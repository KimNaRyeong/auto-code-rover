        "intended_behavior": "Within the `_fit` method, specifically around the refitting logic indicated by `if self.refit:...`, code should be introduced to measure the start and end time around the `best_estimator.fit(X, y, **self.fit_params)` call. This could be achieved by using time measurement functions (e.g., using `time.time()` before and after the fit call). The difference between these two timestamps should be stored in a new attribute of the `GridSearchCV` class, named `refit_time_`. This attribute would then capture the time taken to refit the best estimator on the full dataset. This timing information should be captured regardless of whether `y` is `None` or provided, ensuring that it always reflects the duration of the refitting process. The implementation must ensure this additional feature does not alter the original logic or flow of the method but serves as an add-on information point for users who might need to know the refit timing."
