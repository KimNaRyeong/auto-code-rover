Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue description and the results from the `search_method(\"simplify\")` call, we can determine that the most likely location for addressing the reported bug would be within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. This file is the most direct and obvious place where the `simplify` function's logic for symbolic simplification would reside, especially considering the user's experience with Laplacian computations in different geometrical coordinate systems. \n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The code within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` likely contains the primary implementation of the `simplify` function, including the various strategies it uses to reduce expressions. This method is fundamental for symbolic mathematical simplifications in sympy, trying different algebraic, numerical, and functional techniques to condense expressions into simpler forms.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug described by the user involves the `simplify` function not fully reducing an expression to its simplest form on the first application but requiring a second application to achieve further simplification. This suggests that the recursive or iterative potential of simplification strategies might not be fully exploited or that the order in which these strategies are applied could be optimized. The described bug directly implicates the logic encapsulated within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, as any modifications to address this issue will likely occur here.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior, as hinted at by the user's suggested fix, would be for the `simplify` function to include an option to recursively apply simplification strategies a specified number of times or until no further simplification is possible. This involves adding a parameter for controlling recursion depth (e.g., `max_rec_steps`) and implementing logic to recursively invoke `simplify` according to this parameter. This change aims to ensure that expressions can be reduced to their absolute simplest form in a single call, leveraging the full range of simplification strategies available.\n\nTo progress toward crafting a patch, it would be beneficial to investigate the implementation details of the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. This will provide insights into how the function currently operates, how recursive simplifications could be integrated, and where modifications are necessary to introduce the proposed feature. Therefore, a closer examination of the `simplify` function's implementation in this file is required. \n\nConsidering this analysis, the next logical step would be to specifically examine the `simplify` function within the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file, using:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")` - To get the implementation details of the `simplify` function."

If `max_rec_steps > 0`, the function will attempt to apply further simplifications up to the specified number of times or until no further simplification is achieved.\n\n  The intended behavior incorporates:\n  - An additional parameter in the function signature for controlling the depth of recursive simplification.\n  - A recursive mechanism that checks if the simplified expression could be simplified further, decrementing the `max_rec_steps` counter with each recursive call.\n  - A base case where the function stops recursing either when `max_rec_steps` reaches 0 or when further calls to `simplify` yield no further simplification (i.e., when the operation count or some other complexity measure of the expression does not decrease).\n  - Preserving the existing functionality of the code by ensuring that if `max_rec_steps` is not specified or is 0, the function behaves exactly as before, maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n  This enhancement aims to allow users to specify the depth of the simplification process explicitly, potentially avoiding the need for manual, repeated calls to the `simplify` function to achieve a deeper simplification."
