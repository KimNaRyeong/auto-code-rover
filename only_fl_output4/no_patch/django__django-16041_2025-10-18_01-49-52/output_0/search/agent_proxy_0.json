            "content": "To understand and resolve the issue, we need a concrete understanding of several components:\n\n1. **Django's form handling**: Specifically, we need to understand how `form_kwargs` is processed and applied to forms and formsets. Since the issue is with `empty_permitted` being used within `form_kwargs`, it's essential to understand where and how these kwargs are used.\n\n2. **Rendering of `empty_form`**: Since the error occurs when rendering the `empty_form`, we need to see how `empty_form` is rendered, and how it interacts with `form_kwargs`.\n\n3. **Implementation of `modelformset_factory` and formset handling**: Understanding how `modelformset_factory` processes the `form_kwargs` and how it affects the `empty_form`.\n\nBased on these needs, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n- To understand how `form_kwargs` is processed within formsets, it would be beneficial to look into the implementation of `modelformset_factory`. However, since `modelformset_factory` is a function rather than a class, we might instead need to look into classes it interacts with, such as formsets. Let's look into the base formset class which might be handling the `form_kwargs`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseFormSet\")\n```\n\n- We need to understand the implementation of `empty_form` within the formset class to see how it handles or should handle `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n```\n\n- As the rendering of the `empty_form` is likely happening within a template, it might not be directly visible in Python code how `empty_permitted` interacts here. But since the issue suggests a KeyError related to `empty_permitted`, it implies there's a part of the code explicitly accessing this key. Let's directly search for the usage of `empty_permitted` in the codebase to find any explicit mentions or handling within form or formset classes.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"empty_permitted\")\n```\n\nThese three API calls should give us a good starting point to understand how `empty_permitted` is supposed to work with `form_kwargs` in Django formsets, how `empty_form` is implemented, and provide clues on why setting `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` causes a crash when rendering `empty_form`."
