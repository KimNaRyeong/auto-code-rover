        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue, we need a concrete understanding of several components:\n\n1. **Django's form handling**: Specifically, we need to understand how `form_kwargs` is processed and applied to forms and formsets. Since the issue is with `empty_permitted` being used within `form_kwargs`, it's essential to understand where and how these kwargs are used.\n\n2. **Rendering of `empty_form`**: Since the error occurs when rendering the `empty_form`, we need to see how `empty_form` is rendered, and how it interacts with `form_kwargs`.\n\n3. **Implementation of `modelformset_factory` and formset handling**: Understanding how `modelformset_factory` processes the `form_kwargs` and how it affects the `empty_form`.\n\nBased on these needs, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n- To understand how `form_kwargs` is processed within formsets, it would be beneficial to look into the implementation of `modelformset_factory`. However, since `modelformset_factory` is a function rather than a class, we might instead need to look into classes it interacts with, such as formsets. Let's look into the base formset class which might be handling the `form_kwargs`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseFormSet\")\n```\n\n- We need to understand the implementation of `empty_form` within the formset class to see how it handles or should handle `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n```\n\n- As the rendering of the `empty_form` is likely happening within a template, it might not be directly visible in Python code how `empty_permitted` interacts here. But since the issue suggests a KeyError related to `empty_permitted`, it implies there's a part of the code explicitly accessing this key. Let's directly search for the usage of `empty_permitted` in the codebase to find any explicit mentions or handling within form or formset classes.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"empty_permitted\")\n```\n\nThese three API calls should give us a good starting point to understand how `empty_permitted` is supposed to work with `form_kwargs` in Django formsets, how `empty_form` is implemented, and provide clues on why setting `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` causes a crash when rendering `empty_form`."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API calls, we can begin to piece together how `empty_permitted` is being used and potentially where the issue arises in relation to the bug reported.\n\n### Analysis of `BaseFormSet` and the `empty_form` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   - The `BaseFormSet` class is a fundamental part of Django's form handling that manages collections of forms. It has a method `empty_form` that returns a form instance created with a special prefix and set to be `empty_permitted`. This means the form is allowed not to have any data, which is essential for the template rendering of `empty_form` instances used as placeholders for new records in a formset.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   - The method `empty_form`, by default, explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True`. This specific implementation hints that `empty_form` is designed not to require validation for the presence of data. The issue arises when `form_kwargs={'empty_permitted': True}` is passed, leading to a `KeyError` during rendering, indicating that somewhere in the process, the handling of `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` is not aligning with the expectation that it shouldn't affect `empty_form`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   - The intended behavior would be for `form_kwargs` to be applied to forms within the formset without causing issues for `empty_form`. Since `empty_form` always has `empty_permitted` set to `True` internally, it's likely that `form_kwargs` passed by users should either not override this setting for `empty_form` or the system should handle such overrides gracefully, without resulting in errors.\n\n### Analysis of `empty_permitted` usages\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   - The references to `empty_permitted` across various files indicate its critical role in form validation logic. Its presence in both `django/forms/forms.py` and `django/forms/models.py`, in addition to `formsets.py`, shows it's a pervasive aspect of Django's forms system, affecting both individual forms and formsets.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   - Given the nature of the bug, the core issue likely involves how `empty_permitted` is handled or mishandled when passed through `form_kwargs` and during the instantiation of `empty_form`. The bug suggests there's a mismatch between user expectations (and explicit settings) and the formset's internal handling of the `empty_permitted` flag, particularly for `empty_form`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   - Ideally, the system should respect custom `form_kwargs` for regular forms within a formset but ensure that the special `empty_form` behavior is preserved or that deviations are handled gracefully\u2014essentially, ensuring that setting `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` does not crash the rendering of `empty_form`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the path to a solution would involve ensuring that the `empty_form` ignores `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` or handles it in a way that does not interfere with its internal setup that allows it to be rendered without data. This could involve modifying how `form_kwargs` are processed when generating `empty_form`, perhaps by filtering out or overriding the `empty_permitted` flag specifically for `empty_form` instances."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Therefore:\n\n1. **We do not need more context.**\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `django/forms/formsets.py`\n     - **Class:** `BaseFormSet`\n     - **Method:** `empty_form`\n  \n     **Intended Behavior:** Currently, the `empty_form` method explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True` for the form it returns. The issue arises when `form_kwargs` with `empty_permitted` specified are passed to formsets, impacting the `empty_form`. The intended behavior should ensure that `empty_form` behaves independently of `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` provided by users. This means adjusting the internal handling to either ignore `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` when creating `empty_form` or implementing logic to ensure that the explicit setting of `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs` does not affect or break the rendering of `empty_form`. This could involve modifying the way `empty_form` is instantiated to filter out `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` or setting it after instantiating the form with user-provided `form_kwargs`, ensuring it always remains `True` for `empty_form`.\n\n   This solution would preserve the functionality of allowing customization through `form_kwargs` while ensuring the special case of `empty_form` remains functional and consistent with the expectations of its use case. The goal is to maintain the flexibility offered by Django formsets and their configurations without the unintended side-effect of breaking when `empty_permitted` is explicitly defined by a developer."
