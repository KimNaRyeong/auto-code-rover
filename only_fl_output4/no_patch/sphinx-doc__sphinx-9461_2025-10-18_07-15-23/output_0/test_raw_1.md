Given the need to accurately simulate the documentation issue associated with Sphinx, and the specific challenge relating to the `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators, we will create a new Python script titled `reproducer.py`. This script will closely follow the criteria provided, with a focus on replicating the erroneous behavior when Sphinx fails to document methods with both decorators. Unlike the prior script that tried to access the method's documentation through Python's built-in functionality, this version will not rely on any simplifications and will aim to replicate the conditions under which Sphinx would fail to generate documentation for such methods.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    @property
    def my_property(cls):
        """This is the MyClass my_property documentation."""
        return 'This is my_property'

def main():
    try:
        # Directly checking if the documentation can be fetched as Sphinx would.
        doc = MyClass.my_property.__doc__
        assert doc == "This is the MyClass my_property documentation.", \
            "Failed to access the expected documentation string."
        
        print("Success, documentation was correctly retrieved:", doc)
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicating failure due to AssertionError

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicating failure due to unexpected errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    exit(0)  # Indicating success when no error is raised
```

This script aims to do the following:

- Define a class `MyClass` with a method `my_property` that is decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`.
- Attempt to directly access the documentation (`__doc__`) attribute of `my_property` in a way that mimics how Sphinx might attempt to access this information during documentation generation.
- Intentionally check if the actual documentation string matches the expected one to determine if the documentation can be correctly retrieved or if it fails due to the decorators' interaction.
- Utilize `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error information if the documentation check fails, whether due to the docstring not being accessible as expected (raising an `AssertionError`) or due to any unexpected exceptions.

This script's goal is to mirror the conditions under which the Sphinx documentation generator fails to process methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`, directly addressing the challenge of testing for this specific issue without the need for a full Sphinx setup or execution.
