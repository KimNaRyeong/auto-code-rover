However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

The failure to find classes and methods could indicate a need for broader or different search strategies, considering possible issues such as mismatches in class or method names, or challenges in locating them within the codebase structure.\n\nSince direct searching for classes, class methods, and the code pattern did not yield results, let's consider alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Broaden the code snippet search criteria:** Given that direct code pattern `@classmethod\\n@property` did not return results, it's possible that the codebase uses variances of this pattern, or that the formatting affected the search. A broader search might involve looking for instances of `@classmethod` and `@property` separately or in a broader context. However, this might return too general results, considering these decorators are common in Python codebases.\n\n2. **Search for relevant files:** Since the classes and methods can't be directly found, it might be beneficial to search for files that likely contain these classes based on naming conventions or related modules. The repository mentioned is a \"sphinx_demo\", hinting at demonstration purposes for Sphinx documentation. If the issue describes missing documentation for certain class methods, it might be helpful to search for files related to Sphinx configuration or documentation sources in the project.\n\nGiven the limitations in direct searching, the following API calls could provide additional context or indirect paths to find relevant code:\n\n- `search_code(\"class\")`: This broad search might return too many results but can help in identifying how classes are declared if there's a specific pattern or naming convention used that differs from the standard expectations.\n- `search_code(\"def\")`: Similar to searching for \"class\", this aims to catch how methods are defined, possibly catching unique implementations of class methods or properties.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"sphinx\", \"conf.py\")`: This attempts to find configurations related to Sphinx documentation, assuming \"conf.py\" is the configuration file for Sphinx. It may provide clues on how the documentation is set up or if specific extensions or settings are influencing the documentation output.\n\nThese approaches attempt to circumvent the direct issue of not finding specific classes or methods by gathering more general context on the project structure, class definitions, method definitions, and Sphinx configuration. This broader context might lead to insights about why the issue is occurring or suggest other specific areas of the code or documentation setup that could be the cause of the problem."

Our goal remains to address the issue within the realm of documented class methods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` but are not being captured correctly by Sphinx. \n\nGiven the lack of direct hits from our previous search attempts and the specificities mentioned in the bug report, we need to pivot our strategy towards broader aspects of the codebase that might give us indirect insights or paths to locating the issue, such as the Sphinx configuration itself or examples of class and method declarations as they might pertain to Sphinx's autodoc functionality.\n\nHowever, the previous guidance made errors in proposing nonexistent API call formats and in directing towards a more exploratory search without concrete base points in the actual error report and the tools at our disposal.\n\n### Revised Approach for More Context\n\nLet's correct the approach by focusing on possibly gathering more context related information directly from the declared project repository and its stated structure if such were possible within our operational constraints:\n\n1. **Investigate Sphinx configuration**:\n   - Given the issue's nature revolving around documentation generation via Sphinx, and noting that we cannot directly call upon project files like `conf.py` through our specific API capabilities, the logical step would include directly examining the project's Sphinx configuration files if accessible. This would be to see if certain plugins or settings might affect the documentation of class methods decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n\n2. **Review Python Versions and Sphinx Versions**:\n   - The issue notes amendments in Python 3.10 addressing similar concerns. A relevant action would entail verifying the Python version dependency directed for Sphinx within the project and the specific Sphinx version utilized, especially since Sphinx versioning and its compatibility with Python versions could be central to this issue.\n\nGiven the above understanding and the redirection towards a more theoretical resolution pathway without the direct use of additional API calls to gather more context due to the initial misunderstanding, we can reconceptualize our limitations and approach:\n\n### Hypothetical Resolution Pathway Based on Initial Bug Report\n\nWithout direct access to or findings from the search API to pinpoint specific code instances:\n\n- The conversation around resolving the issue gravitates towards ensuring compatibility between the Sphinx version used and the Python version, as detailed in the bug edits and descriptions within the original report.\n- Since the functionality mentioned (classmethods being able to wrap other descriptors such as `property()`) is highlighted as changing in versions post Python 3.9 and noted within Sphinx's documentation process, ensuring that both Python and Sphinx are in versions that support this would be key.\n- Additionally, verifying Sphinx extensions or configurations that explicitly facilitate or enhance the recognition of complex class method decorations could act as a fallback to ensure the desired documentation output.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe guidance offered lacks the execution of viable API calls under the constraints provided and instead proposes a conceptual framework for navigating the issue based on compatibility and configuration checks in lieu of unavailable direct insights from the codebase."
