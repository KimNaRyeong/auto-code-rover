Given your correction and to ensure the script functions as required—raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, printing a detailed stack trace, and exiting with code `0` when the issue is fixed—below is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` file. This version attempts to directly invoke the problematic scenario in a controlled manner, leveraging exception handling to catch the specific `TypeError`, and using the provided `print_stacktrace` function for detailed output when the error is encountered.

```python
import pytest

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pytest_none_approx():
    actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
    expected_result = {"a": None}
    try:
        approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
        assert approx_expected_result == actual_result
        # If the code gets here without a TypeError, the issue is considered fixed
        print("No TypeError encountered. Issue may be resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        # If a TypeError is encountered, print the stack trace and exit with code 1
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catching AssertionError to differentiate it from other exceptions
        print("AssertionError (as expected when issue is fixed):", e)
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other exceptions and printing their stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pytest_none_approx()
```

This script uses direct execution to try and replicate the issue described. When running, it will attempt the comparison using `pytest.approx()` with an `expected_result` that contains `None`, which previously led to a `TypeError`. If such an error occurs, the script captures it, prints a detailed stack trace using the provided function, and exits with code `1`. Otherwise, if an `AssertionError` is correctly raised by the assertion statement—indicating the expected functioning of the test—it exits with code `0` to signal no issue.

To run this script, save it as `reproducer.py` in your project's root directory and execute it with Python 3: `python3 reproducer.py`. This standalone execution mimics a miniature testing environment, adapting to the constraints provided.
