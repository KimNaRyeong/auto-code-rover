If `actual` or the object being compared (`self.expected`) is `None`, the method should return `False` directly or raise a more descriptive error indicating that `None` values cannot be compared using `approx`. This change ensures that users are not met with a `TypeError` due to unsupported arithmetic operations involving `None`, but instead receive clear feedback on the nature of the error."

        "method": "__eq__",
        "intended_behavior": "In the `__eq__` method, before performing any comparison, check if any value in the `actual` mapping or in the expected mapping (`self.expected`) is `None`. If so, handle gracefully by either explicitly returning `False` to indicate non-equality due to `None` values or raise an informative exception that `None` values are not supported for approximate comparisons in dictionaries. This will guide the user to either correct the test or adjust their expectations regarding the use of `approx` with mappings containing `None`."
