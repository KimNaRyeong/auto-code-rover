Given the detail in the issue, `pytest.approx` seems like the main point of failure when it comes to handling `None` types. Our goal is to see how this function handles inputs and to identify any logic that leads to the `TypeError`.\n\nLet's proceed with the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"approx\")`: To find where the `approx` function is defined in the pytest codebase.\n- `search_code(\"TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'\")`: This search can help identify if there's a known issue or specific handling of this error type elsewhere in the codebase that could provide clues."
