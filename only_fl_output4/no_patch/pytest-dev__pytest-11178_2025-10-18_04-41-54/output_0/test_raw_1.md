To properly reproduce the issue using a standalone Python file and ensure that the test can be executed without directly using `pytest` as a module within the script (which led to the `AttributeError` due to `pytest.approx` not being recognized when executed in a non-test environment), we need to approach this by incorporating a way to run the `pytest` runner programmatically. The exact issue described stems from using `pytest.approx` in a manner that encounters a `None` type value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Given the constraints and the target execution environment (running the script directly with `python3`), a more applicable solution would be to create a temporary test file programmatically within our script and then execute this test file using `pytest`'s command-line interface through the `subprocess` module. This approach allows us to capture the output and exit code correctly to verify if the issue persists or is resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Create a temporary pytest test file
test_code = """
import pytest

def test_pytest_none_approx():
    actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
    expected_result = {"a": None}
    approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
    assert approx_expected_result == actual_result
"""

# Write test code to a temp file
temp_test_file = "temp_test_pytest_approx.py"
with open(temp_test_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(test_code)

# Run pytest on the generated test file
try:
    result = subprocess.run(["pytest", temp_test_file], text=True, capture_output=True)
    # Check if the test failed due to the expected TypeError
    if "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'" in result.stderr:
        print("Issue reproduced: TypeError encountered when using pytest.approx with NoneType.")
        print(result.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate issue presence
    else:
        print("No TypeError encountered. Issue may be resolved.")
        sys.exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script creates a temporary pytest test file that encapsulates the original issue scenario. It then executes this test using the `pytest` command through `subprocess.run`. If the `TypeError` related to the use of `pytest.approx` with `NoneType` is present in the stderr output, the script identifies that the issue has been successfully reproduced, prints the relevant stack trace, and exits with code 1. If the test passes or fails for a reason other than the described `TypeError`, it suggests that the specific issue might not be reproducible under the current environment or pytest version, and the script exits with code 0, indicating no issue.
