This script checks if applying `StandardScaler` to a large `float16` numpy array results in overflow, by detecting the presence of `NaN` values in the transformed array. If it does, it raises an `AssertionError`. The script uses a custom function `print_stacktrace` to print a clear stack trace if an exception occurs. The main function encapsulates the testing logic, and if an error is caught, the script will exit with code 0, thereby indicating that when the issue exists or is simulated accurately, it's expected to exit in this manner. This approach ensures that the script's behavior correctly reflects the state of the issue it's designed to reproduce.
