We need to know how `StandardScaler` calculates the mean and standard deviation and whether these calculations can be adjusted to prevent overflow with `float16`. It will be beneficial to look at the implementation of `fit`, `fit_transform`, and any related methods, such as those for computing mean and standard deviation, within the `StandardScaler` class. Moreover, inspecting how NumPy's operations are handled in this context would also provide valuable insights.\n\nI will begin by searching for the `StandardScaler` class and the methods it uses for calculating the mean and standard deviation. Next, I will look into NumPy's mean and std calculation methods as these seem to be directly involved in the issue.\n\n- search_class(\"StandardScaler\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StandardScaler\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"StandardScaler\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"_compute_mean_std\", \"StandardScaler\")  # Assuming there might be an internal method for this\n- search_method(\"mean\")  # To get context on how NumPy mean calculation is performed\n- search_method(\"std\")  # To get context on how NumPy std calculation is performed"
