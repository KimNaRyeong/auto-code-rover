        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the overflow issue when using `float16` data types, the `partial_fit` method should be enhanced to either: Dynamically adjust the computation data type for mean and standard deviation calculations to a higher precision (e.g., `float32` or `float64`) if the input data type is `float16`. This would prevent overflow during these computations. After computation, the scaling factors (mean, variance) can be cast back to `float16` if necessary to maintain the original data type fidelity for the transformation process. Implement a numerically stable algorithm for calculating mean and standard deviation specifically designed to handle `float16` without overflow. This might involve utilizing algorithms that mitigate the risks of overflow by design. In either approach, it is crucial that this fix: Does not negatively impact the performance and accuracy for data types not prone to this issue. Maintains compatibility with the existing API and functionality of `StandardScaler`. Includes checks to ensure that any temporary increase in data type precision does not inadvertently consume excessive memory, considering the original motivation for using `float16`. This solution should provide a balance between numerical stability and resource efficiency, addressing the core of the issue while preserving the scalability and utility of the `StandardScaler` for large datasets and diverse data types."
