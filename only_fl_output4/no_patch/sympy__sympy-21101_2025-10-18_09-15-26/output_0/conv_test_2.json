If the script exits with code 1, it indicates the issue is present; the script details the assertion failure in the standard error output, relying on the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clarity. Conversely, exiting with code 0 signifies the absence of the described issue, indicating it's been fixed or could not be reproduced under the current conditions."
