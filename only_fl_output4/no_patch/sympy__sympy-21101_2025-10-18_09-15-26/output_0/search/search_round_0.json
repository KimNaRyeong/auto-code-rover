This is likely done by a method that handles the conversion of symbolic expressions to their LaTeX form.\n\n```python\nsearch_method('latex')\n```\n\n3. **Search for code handling `evaluate=False`**: The issue description points out a problem when `Mul` is used with `evaluate=False`. Therefore, finding how evaluation control is implemented may provide insight into where the problem lies.\n\n```python\nsearch_code('evaluate=False')\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at covering essential areas related to the issue: the multiplication operation, its LaTeX conversion, and the evaluation control mechanism in the codebase.\n\nPlease proceed with these API calls."
