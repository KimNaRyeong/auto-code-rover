Here's a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the issue mentioned. It checks whether latex output from an unevaluated `Mul` operation in Sympy correctly displays the `numbersep` between numbers:

```python
from sympy import S, latex, Mul

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        result = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))
        # We expect a space (or some separator) between "6" and "1/2", which is missing.
        assert result == '6 \\frac{1}{2}', f"Output was {result}, but expected '6 \\frac{1}{2}'"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nIssue detected: Latex representation is incorrect as there's no separator between numbers.")
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure you have Sympy installed in your Python environment (`pip install sympy`), and then run this script with `python3 reproducer.py` from the root directory of your project. The script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., if the `latex` function does not insert a separator between the numbers "6" and "\frac{1}{2}"). If the issue is fixed, and the output is as expected, the script exits normally with code 0.
