Given the clarification and goal, let's adjust the approach to ensure the script correctly identifies the issue based on your description: the absence of a separator (specifically `numbersep`) in the output of the `latex` function from Sympy when handling an unevaluated `Mul` object. We'll modify the assertion to correctly capture and assert the presence of this issue.

```python
from sympy import S, latex, Mul

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        result = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))
        # Checking if there's a space or some separator in the result. The issue is there's none.
        # Since the issue describes an incorrect latex string due to the absence of `numbersep`,
        # we'll directly check for the issue's presence by confirming the current incorrect output.
        correct_output = '6 \\frac{1}{2}'
        assert " " in result, f"Expected a space (numbersep) in the result; found '{result}'"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nIssue detected: Latex representation is incorrect as there's no separator between numbers.")
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected. Expected behavior is present. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of `reproducer.py` specifically checks for the issue as described: the absence of a separator (like a space, denoted as `numbersep` in the context) in the `latex` output for an unevaluated `Mul` expression. If the script exits with code 1, it indicates the issue is present; the script details the assertion failure in the standard error output, relying on the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clarity. Conversely, exiting with code 0 signifies the absence of the described issue, indicating it's been fixed or could not be reproduced under the current conditions.
