To reproduce the issue and adhere to your instructions more closely, I'll provide a more complete implementation. We'll programmatically emulate the steps that produce the issue: creating a user and post, performing a search that would involve the many-to-many relationship, and attempting to delete via the admin action programmatically.

Given the specificity of the issue, which involves Django admin operations, a direct script-based approach to interacting with admin views is not straightforward without a web request. However, we can simulate the conditions that lead to the crash and check if the deletion causes a `TypeError` as described.

```python
# reproducer.py

import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin

# Setup Django environment
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    SECRET_KEY='a-random-secret-key',
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
    ),
    ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,
)

django.setup()

from django.http import HttpRequest
from django.contrib.admin.sites import AdminSite
from django.contrib.auth.models import User as DjangoUser

# Models definition
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(User)

admin.site.register(User)
admin.site.register(Post)

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Setup test data
    user = User.objects.create(email='author@example.com')
    post = Post.objects.create(title='Test Post')
    post.authors.add(user)
    
    request = HttpRequest()
    request.method = 'POST'
    request.user = DjangoUser.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@admin.com', 'password')

    # Attempt to perform the action that leads to the crash
    try:
        PostAdmin = admin.site._registry[Post]
        queryset = Post.objects.all()
        # Using the delete selected action to simulate the error
        PostAdmin.get_actions(request)['delete_selected'][0](PostAdmin, request, queryset)
        print("No error occurred, issue might be fixed or not reproduced.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, TypeError), "The encountered exception is not the expected TypeError."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "__main__")
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script does the following:
- Sets up a minimal Django environment.
- Defines the models and admin classes according to your issue description.
- Attempts to simulate the deletion action in the Django admin that causes the issue.

The script attempts to catch `TypeError` specifically at the deletion point and uses the provided function to print a stack trace if it occurs. This serves to mimic the environment and actions leading to the described bug within admin operations.
