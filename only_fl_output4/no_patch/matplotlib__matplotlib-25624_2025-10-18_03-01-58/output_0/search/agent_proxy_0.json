Here are the API calls that should provide the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `tight_layout` method in the entire codebase to find where it is defined and how it's implemented. This information is crucial for understanding how kwargs are handled within the method.\n   - `search_method(\"tight_layout\")`\n\n2. Search for any code snippet that references the `rcParams` or `figure.autolayout` setting to see how it is used throughout the project, especially in relation to layout adjustments. This could give us insights into how the auto layout feature is designed to override or interact with manual layout adjustments like `tight_layout`.\n   - `search_code(\"figure.autolayout\")`\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions the kwargs passed to `tight_layout` not having an effect, it could be insightful to look for where those kwargs (e.g., `w_pad`) are being handled or ignored when `figure.autolayout` is set to True.\n   - `search_code(\"w_pad\")`"
