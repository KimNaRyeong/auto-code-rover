        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to consider whether `figure.autolayout` is enabled and, if so, either integrate `tight_layout`'s kwargs (`w_pad`, among others) into the autolayout process or provide a clear warning that `tight_layout` settings are being overridden by `figure.autolayout`. The intended behavior should ensure that when `tight_layout` is explicitly called, its parameters (like `w_pad`) are respected, either by adjusting the layout accordingly or by informing the user why these settings cannot be applied because `figure.autolayout` takes precedence. The primary goal is to make the interaction between manual layout adjustments (`tight_layout`) and automatic layout (`figure.autolayout`) transparent and predictable for the user."
