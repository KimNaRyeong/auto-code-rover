        "intended_behavior": "This file, responsible for generating the inheritance diagrams, should ensure the generated SVG links correctly point to the associated class documentation files relative to the HTML page's URL in which the diagram is displayed. The intended behavior is to modify the link generation logic within this file so that it correctly computes links relative to the document embedding the SVG, rather than relative to the file system path of the SVG itself. This requires adjusting how URLs within the SVG are calculated, specifically ensuring that they account for the document's location within the site structure. This may involve appending a correct base path or modifying how relative paths are computed within the SVG generation logic."
