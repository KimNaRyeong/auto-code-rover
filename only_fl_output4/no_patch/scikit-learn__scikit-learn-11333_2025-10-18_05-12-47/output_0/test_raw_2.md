To write a script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue where `_BaseCompostion._set_params` is broken due to no estimators being present and adheres to your conditions, follow the updated code block below. This script specifically checks for the issue to be reproduced, captures the stack trace if an error occurs as expected, and asserts a failure if the stack trace does not match the expected outcome.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # Attempt to reproduce the issue
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
    except ValueError as e:
        # Check the error message to confirm it's the known issue
        expected_msg = "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)"
        if str(e) == expected_msg:
            print("The issue was reproduced successfully.")
        else:
            print("A ValueError was raised, but the message was unexpected.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1) # Exit with an error code if the issue is not as expected
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception was caught.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No exception was raised. The issue may have been fixed.")
        exit(0) # Exit with code 0 to indicate potential resolution of the issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_issue()
```

This script aims to reproduce the problem stated in the issue report and uses assertions and error messages to indicate whether the problem still exists or might have been resolved. The exit codes are included to signal the result of the test, where an exit code of `0` suggests the issue might have been fixed based on the script's execution flow not encountering the anticipated error.
