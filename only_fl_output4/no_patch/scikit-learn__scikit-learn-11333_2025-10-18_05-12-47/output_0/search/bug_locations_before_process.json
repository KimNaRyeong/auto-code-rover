        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `_set_params` method should be modified to handle the case when there are no transformers (or estimators) to set parameters on. Specifically, before the line attempting to unpack names with `names, _ = zip(*getattr(self, attr))`, the method should check if `getattr(self, attr)` is an empty list. If it is, the method should skip the unpacking process and directly proceed to the next steps of setting parameters. This change ensures that the method can gracefully handle scenarios where there are no estimators in the composition, thereby preventing the `ValueError` described in the issue. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality of setting parameters when there are estimators while also accommodating compositions with no estimators without causing errors."
