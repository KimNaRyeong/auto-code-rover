        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `_BaseComposition._set_params` method and how it is used within the context of the `ColumnTransformer` class. Given the traceback, we also need to understand the code structure within `_column_transformer.py` and `metaestimators.py`. Here are the API calls that would help gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `_BaseComposition` class to understand its structure and related methods:\n   - `search_class(\"_BaseComposition\")`\n\n2. Since the error occurs in `ColumnTransformer`'s usage of `_set_params`, we need to inspect the `ColumnTransformer` class for its definition and any relevant methods:\n   - `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n3. The error traceback mentions `metaestimators.py`, indicating `_set_params` might be defined or modified there. To explore this, we should find the `_set_params` method within the file where `_BaseComposition` is possibly defined or used:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_set_params\", \"_BaseComposition\")`\n\n4. The error is specifically raised when trying to unpack values in `metaestimators.py`. Investigating the `_set_params` method directly in `metaestimators.py` would provide insight into the error cause:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_set_params\", \"sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py\")`\n\n5. Lastly, to understand how `ColumnTransformer` calls `_set_params` which leads to the error, we should find the `set_params` method within the `ColumnTransformer` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_params\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of how `_set_params` is implemented and invoked, which is crucial for diagnosing the reported issue and identifying a potential fix."
