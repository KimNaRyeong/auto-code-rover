        "intended_behavior": "The method's implementation needs to ensure that when `keep_attrs=True`, the attributes present in the original `DataArray` are preserved and passed along to the resulting `DataArray` generated after computing the quantile. This requires possibly modifying the `_to_temp_dataset().quantile()` call and the handling within `_from_temp_dataset(ds)` to ensure `keep_attrs` is respected and effectively implemented. To resolve the issue, the method should verify after these calls that attributes are correctly handled. If necessary, additional logic may need to be added either in the `quantile` method itself or within the `_from_temp_dataset(ds)` method to ensure attributes are explicitly carried over when `keep_attrs` is set to True. The existing functionality for computing quantiles must remain unchanged; the fix should solely ensure that the `keep_attrs` parameter correctly influences whether attributes are retained in the output."
