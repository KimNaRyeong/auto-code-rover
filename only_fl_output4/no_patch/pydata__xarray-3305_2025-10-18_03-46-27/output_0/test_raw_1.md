Given the error message from the previous attempt to run the test script, which mentioned an issue with `np.unicode_` being removed in NumPy 2.0 and suggested using `np.str_` instead, it seems there was a misunderstanding. That error did not originate from the test script designed to reproduce the reported issue but from attempting to execute it in an incompatible environment. The script was not executed due to incompatibilities between the xarray version and the Python/NumPy version used in the provided environment.

However, the request was for a script to reproduce a specific issue about attributes not being preserved by the `quantile` method in xarray, unrelated to the environment incompatibility. Given the initial instructions and focusing purely on the xarray issue related to `keep_attrs`, I will provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that checks for the attribute preservation issue in `DataArray.quantile`. Please ensure that you run this in an environment compatible with your xarray version:

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units':'K'})
    out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
    assert out.attrs == {'units': 'K'}, "quantile did not keep attributes"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # If any other exception occurs, print its stacktrace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("Issue not present, exited with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script should be executed in an environment where the versions of Python, xarray, and NumPy are compatible and correctly installed. The script purposefully checks for the preservation of attributes by `quantile` and exits with code 0 if the issue is not present, indicating the problem has been resolved, or exits with code 1 and prints a stack trace if the issue persists or any other error occurs.
