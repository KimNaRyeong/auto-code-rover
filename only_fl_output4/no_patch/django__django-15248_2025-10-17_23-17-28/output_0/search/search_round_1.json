        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context from the API calls, here are the insights based on the provided code snippets and descriptions:\n\n1. **django/db/models/query.py (QuerySet's delete method)**:\n   - This method is responsible for deleting records in the current QuerySet.\n   - The deletion process does not simply remove the target object(s); instead, it involves a two-step operation where it first identifies related objects that might also need to be deleted (to maintain database integrity) and then proceeds with deleting those objects.\n   - The issue at hand discusses enhancing signals (like pre/post delete signals, which were not found in the codebase) to include more context about the origin of the delete operation. Thus, this method is directly related to the issue because it's one of the places where we can modify or extend the logic to include details about whether the deletion was initiated directly (via model instance) or through a queryset, thereby providing the necessary context to signal listeners.\n\n2. **django/db/models/base.py (Model's delete method)**:\n   - The `delete` method in Django's model class allows individual model instances to be deleted.\n   - This method could be leveraged to track deletions initiated by direct model instance deletions as opposed to queryset deletions. Since the issue focuses on capturing the origin of delete actions, enhancing this method to include such information could be a part of the solution.\n   - Given the issue's requirements, the intended behavior here would be modified to include additional context that could then be emitted through signals (if those signals are to be extended or created to address the bug). This would involve capturing and passing along the origin of the deletion.\n\n3. **Absence of pre_delete and post_delete in the results**:\n   - Despite the fact that Django has `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals, they were not found in the codebase search results. This absence implies either a limitation of the search scope or that the actual signal definition and handling reside somewhere not covered by the invoked API calls.\n   - These signals are part of Django's mechanism to allow applications to respond to model deletion events. The issue suggests extending these or similar mechanisms to include detailed origin information about the deletion. Therefore, the absence in search results might necessitate a more direct lookup in Django's documentation or source code, or the investigation of how to extend or hook into Django signals more effectively.\n\nGiven these insights, the approach to solving the issue could involve:\n- Extending the queryset and model instance's delete methods to gather and pass information about the deletion's origin (direct instance delete versus queryset delete).\n- Investigating or implementing signal handling that can make use of this extended information to provide detailed context to listeners about the cause and nature of the deletion event."

Specifically, it should be modified to pass along a context or flag indicating the delete was initiated from a queryset. This information can then be picked up by signal listeners to determine the deletion's origin. The functionality to collect related objects for deletion and the actual deletion process should remain unchanged.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** django/db/models/base.py\n  - **Class:** Model\n  - **Method:** delete\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to the `QuerySet`'s `delete` method, the `delete` method in the `Model` class should also be modified to include a context or flag that indicates the delete operation was initiated directly on the model instance. This modification enables signal listeners to differentiate between deletes originating from direct model instance deletions versus queryset deletions. All existing features of the method, like handling cascading deletes and maintaining database integrity, must be preserved.\n\nThrough these enhancements, signal listeners would gain the ability to contextually react to deletions by knowing the origin of the delete operation \u2013 whether from a direct model instance deletion or a queryset deletion, thereby addressing the issue as described."
