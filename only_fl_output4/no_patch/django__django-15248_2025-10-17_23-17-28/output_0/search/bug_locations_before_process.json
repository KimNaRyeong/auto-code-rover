        "intended_behavior": "In order to resolve the issue, the `delete` method within the `QuerySet` class needs to be enhanced to track and include the origin of the delete operation. Specifically, it should be modified to pass along a context or flag indicating the delete was initiated from a queryset. This information can then be picked up by signal listeners to determine the deletion's origin. The functionality to collect related objects for deletion and the actual deletion process should remain unchanged."

This modification enables signal listeners to differentiate between deletes originating from direct model instance deletions versus queryset deletions. All existing features of the method, like handling cascading deletes and maintaining database integrity, must be preserved."
