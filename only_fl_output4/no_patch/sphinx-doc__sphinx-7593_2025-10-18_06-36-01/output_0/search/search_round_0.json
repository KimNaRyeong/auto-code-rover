Please describe.**\n[:kbd:](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#role-kbd) describes \"a sequence of keystrokes\". Sphinx converts it to a single [`<kbd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) element:\n```\n:kbd:`Control-x Control-f`\n```\nbecomes\n```html\n<kbd>Control-x Control-f</kbd>\n```\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nPotentially sphinx could parse the `:kbd:` value and convert it to individual (or nested) `<kbd>` elements, which is what [MDN suggests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd#Representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) as a way to represent key combinations. Something like:\n```html\n<-- Individual -->\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n<-- Nested -->\n<kbd>\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatively the sphinx user could rewrite their markup:\n```\n:kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`x` :kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`f`\n```\n**Related**\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3160\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4197\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding the conversion of `:kbd:` into nested `<kbd>` HTML elements, we'll need to look into how Sphinx processes these directives and subsequently transforms them into HTML. Given the description of the issue, it seems we'll need to investigate how Sphinx handles the `:kbd:` role and then generates the HTML output. Considering Sphinx is a documentation tool written in Python, the functionality is likely implemented in one or more Python files that deal with parsing and rendering reStructuredText (RST).\n\nThe following API calls will help us gather the necessary context to understand how Sphinx currently processes the `:kbd:` role and generates `<kbd>` HTML elements:\n\n1. **Search for the class or method where `:kbd:` roles are processed:**\n   Since the `:kbd:` role is a part of Sphinx's reStructuredText processing, there might be a specific method or class handling this role. We can start by looking for any method that sounds like it might be responsible for handling RST roles or specifically the `:kbd:` role.\n\n2. **Search for the code where HTML `<kbd>` elements are generated:**\n   After identifying how `:kbd:` roles are handled, we'll need to find where Sphinx converts these roles into HTML code. This step will require looking for the generation of `<kbd>` tags.\n\nHere are the API calls I'm choosing based on the strategy above:\n\n- `search_method(\"handle_kbd_role\")`\n- `search_code(\":kbd:\")`\n- `search_method(\"generate_html\")`\n- `search_code(\"<kbd>\")`\n\nThese searches aim to cover the handling of the `:kbd:` role and the generation of the HTML tags. After we gather this information, we should have a clearer understanding of where and how to implement the necessary changes for nested `<kbd>` element support."
