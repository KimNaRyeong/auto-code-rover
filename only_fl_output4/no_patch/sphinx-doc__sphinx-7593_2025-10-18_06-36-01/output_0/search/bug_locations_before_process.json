This method should create a representation (e.g., a list of keystrokes) that can be easily converted into nested `<kbd>` HTML tags. The parser should be able to distinguish between individual keystrokes separated by spaces and combinations denoted by `-` or other delimiters. This change must preserve existing functionality for roles that do not require nesting."

For example, if the representation indicates a combination (e.g., \"Control-x\"), it should generate `<kbd><kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd></kbd>`. The implementation should ensure backward compatibility, such that non-nested roles are unaffected and continue to work as they currently do."
