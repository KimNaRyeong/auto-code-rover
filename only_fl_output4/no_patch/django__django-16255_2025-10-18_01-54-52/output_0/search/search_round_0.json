Knowing that this issue arises from trying to invoke `max()` on an empty sequence in this method, and that it's part of the Django framework, we can narrow down the API calls to get precise information:\n\n1. **Search for the `Sitemap` class**: To understand its structure and any relevant methods, especially focusing on `get_latest_lastmod`.\n   \n   `search_class(class_name=\"Sitemap\")`\n   \n2. **Search for the `get_latest_lastmod` method inside the `Sitemap` class**: This will help us understand the exact logic being used currently and how it interacts with `self.items()` and `self.lastmod`.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(method_name=\"get_latest_lastmod\", class_name=\"Sitemap\")`\n   \n3. **Search for code that calls `max()` within the `Sitemap` class**: Since the issue is specifically about handling an empty sequence with `max()`, we can look for invocations of `max()` within this class to see if there are similar protections elsewhere or to better understand the context.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"max(\", file_path=\"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py\")`\n   \nThese API calls are centered around understanding the implementation details of the `get_latest_lastmod` method within the `Sitemap` class to inform how best to implement the proposed solution in the issue."
