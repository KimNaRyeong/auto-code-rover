Given the misunderstanding in the previous script, let's correct the check to ensure it reflects the issue accurately â€” by focusing on ensuring the assertions directly reflect the issue's presence by checking that the expressions do not simplify as expected when the issue exists and that they do as expected, based on periodicity and simplification properties, once the issue is resolved. The following updated Python script aims to address these points more clearly.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy import exp, I, pi, simplify, expand_complex
    
    # Initial expression and its simplification
    expr1 = exp(9*I*pi/4)
    simplify_expr1 = simplify(expr1)
    
    # The expression after trying to simplify it
    difference_expr = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)
    simplify_difference = simplify(difference_expr)
    expand_complex_difference = expand_complex(difference_expr)
    
    # Checking issues
    # Issue 1: `exp` does not simplify using its periodicity.
    assert expr1 != simplify_expr1, "Issue 1: Simplify incorrectly handles expression periodicity."
    # Issue 2: The difference does not simplify correctly to 0.
    assert simplify_difference != 0, "Issue 2: Simplify incorrectly handles the difference."
    # Issue 3: `expand_complex` does not simplify to 0 accurately.
    assert expand_complex_difference != 0, "Issue 3: Expand_complex incorrectly fails to simplify the expression to 0."
    
    # If no assertions are raised
    print("All issues are resolved; the script exits with code 0.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the issue is still present

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred; please check the test case and dependencies.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script specifically assesses whether the issues detailed are present by performing operations that rely on the periodicity and expected simplification capabilities of the `exp` function in a complex argument scenario. It raises assertions tailored to explore each facet of the problem as described. If the issue still exists, it will report through the raised `AssertionError` and exit with code 1, enabling clear identification of unresolved bugs. Conversely, a smooth, issue-free completion of the script would reflect that the described problem has been resolved, conforming to the original requirement for the script's behavior.
