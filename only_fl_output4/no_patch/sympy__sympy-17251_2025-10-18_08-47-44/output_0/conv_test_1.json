It attempts to simplify `exp(9*I*pi/4)`, which should ideally simplify to the same result as `exp(I*pi/4)` because of the periodic nature of the exponential function when dealing with complex numbers. When the issue exists, the script will raise an `AssertionError` as expected and print a stack trace showing where the issue occurs. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating no errors."
