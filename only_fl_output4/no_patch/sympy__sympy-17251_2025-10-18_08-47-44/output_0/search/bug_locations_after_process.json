If\n385     your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n386     determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n387     together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n388     function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n389     will be robust.\n390 \n391     Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n392     anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n393     intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n394     example:\n395 \n396     >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n397     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n398     >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n399     >>> a\n400     (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n401     >>> simplify(a)\n402     x + 1\n403 \n404     Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n405     simplification functions:\n406 \n407     >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n408     >>> trigsimp(a)\n409     (x**2 + x)/x\n410     >>> cancel(_)\n411     x + 1\n412 \n413     In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n414     complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n415     cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n416     unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n417     to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n418     single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n419     expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n420     ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n421     :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n422     expression.\n423 \n424     For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n425     than input.\n426 \n427     ::\n428 \n429         >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n430         >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n431 \n432     Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n433     root is returned unchanged instead::\n434 \n435        >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n436        True\n437 \n438     If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n439 \n440         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n441         True\n442 \n443     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n444     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n445     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n446     choice.\n447 \n448     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n449     should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n450     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n451     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n452     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n453     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n454     one.\n455 \n456     For example:\n457 \n458     >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n459     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n460     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n461     >>> h = simplify(g)\n462     >>> h\n463     log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n464     >>> count_ops(g)\n465     8\n466     >>> count_ops(h)\n467     5\n468 \n469     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n470     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n471     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n472     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n473     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n474 \n475     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n476     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n477     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n478     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n479 \n480     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n481     >>> def my_measure(expr):\n482     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n483     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n484     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n485     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n486     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n487     ...     return count\n488     >>> my_measure(g)\n489     8\n490     >>> my_measure(h)\n491     14\n492     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n493     True\n494     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n495     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n496 \n497     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n498     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n499     function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n500     from the input expression by doing this.\n501 \n502     If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n503     If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n504     be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n505     to the Floats.\n506 \n507     If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n508     functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n509     For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n510     x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is\n511     False.\n512 \n513     Note that ``simplify()`` automatically calls ``doit()`` on the final\n514     expression. You can avoid this behavior by passing ``doit=False`` as\n515     an argument.\n516     \"\"\"\n517     def done(e):\n518         return e.doit() if doit else e\n519 \n520     expr = sympify(expr)\n521     kwargs = dict(\n522         ratio=kwargs.get('ratio', ratio),\n523         measure=kwargs.get('measure', measure),\n524         rational=kwargs.get('rational', rational),\n525         inverse=kwargs.get('inverse', inverse),\n526         doit=kwargs.get('doit', doit))\n527     # no routine for Expr needs to check for is_zero\n528     if isinstance(expr, Expr) and expr.is_zero and expr*0 is S.Zero:\n529         return S.Zero\n530 \n531     _eval_simplify = getattr(expr, '_eval_simplify', None)\n532     if _eval_simplify is not None:\n533         return _eval_simplify(**kwargs)\n534 \n535     original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n536 \n537     from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n538     from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n539     from sympy import Sum, Product, Integral\n540 \n541     if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n542         return expr\n543 \n544     if inverse and expr.has(Function):\n545         expr = inversecombine(expr)\n546         if not expr.args:  # simplified to atomic\n547             return expr\n548 \n549     if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n550         return done(\n551             expr.func(*[simplify(x, **kwargs) for x in expr.args]))\n552 \n553     if not expr.is_commutative:\n554         expr = nc_simplify(expr)\n555 \n556     # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n557     # is it a purely rational function?
