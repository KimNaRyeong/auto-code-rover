        "intended_behavior": "The regex pattern within 'ASCIIUsernameValidator' should be updated from 'r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'' to 'r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z''. This modification ensures that the validation strictly confines to the beginning and end of the string, disallowing trailing newlines in usernames while preserving the allowed set of alphanumeric and special characters (., @, +, -). This change adheres to the project's requirements for ASCIIUsernameValidator by allowing only English letters, numbers, and specific characters (@, ., +, -, _) without trailing newlines."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to 'ASCIIUsernameValidator', the 'UnicodeUsernameValidator' class's regex pattern must be updated from 'r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'' to 'r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z''. This adjustment ensures the validator excludes usernames ending with a newline, strictly enforcing the pattern from the very start to the very end of the string. The change maintains the validator's purpose of allowing letters (including non-English characters due to Unicode support), numbers, and the specified characters while ensuring no trailing newline characters are accepted. This adjustment affirms the project's validation rules for 'UnicodeUsernameValidator' concerning global character support."
