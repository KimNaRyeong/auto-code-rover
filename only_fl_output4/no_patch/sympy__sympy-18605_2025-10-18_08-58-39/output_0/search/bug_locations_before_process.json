        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method in the `Idx` class should enforce that when a range is provided (either as a singular bound or a tuple representing lower and upper bounds), each component of the range must be either a concrete integer, a symbolic expression that is guaranteed to be an integer (e.g., through some form of integer assumption or simplification), or infinity (positive or negative). This validation should ensure that both:\n\n- Singular bounds are checked for integer-likeness not just by direct `is_integer` attribute but also considering symbolic integers.\n  \n- Tuple bounds (`(m, n)`) undergo a more robust check to similarly enforce that both `m` and `n` are integers or valid symbolic representations of integers. This entails ensuring symbolic bounds that are not concretely integers at the time of creation but are intended to represent such (through assumptions, symbolic simplification, or constraints that ensure integer values) are accepted.\n\nThis means revisiting the logic that performs type and property checks on the bounds within the tuple to ensure that symbolic expressions intended to represent integer bounds do not lead to the unintentional acceptance of non-integer bounds. It might involve refining the condition that assesses the \"integer-ness\" of each bound in the tuple, perhaps adding a step where symbolic bounds are assessed not only for their direct `.is_integer` attribute but also any assumptions or properties that guarantee them to represent an integer space within the mathematical modeling of the problem domain.\n\nThis refinement should preserve the existing functionality of allowing integer bounds (both numeric and symbolic), including infinity, while preventing non-integer, non-symbolic-integer, or otherwise invalid bounds from being accepted. This change should securely bridge the gap identified in the issue, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior that aligns with the mathematical intentions behind the `Idx` object's use in symbolic computation."
