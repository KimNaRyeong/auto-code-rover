To ensure a successful execution highlighting the issue within a standalone Django project, let's create a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This version will properly initialize the Django environment before attempting to interact with models or the database, addressing issues related to the Django app registry not being ready.

Here is a corrected and more comprehensive script:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys

# Setting up the basic Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'reproducer_settings')
from django.conf import settings

settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        '__main__',  # This script itself contains the models and is thus treated as an app
    ),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

from django.db import models
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Define models after setting Django configuration
class ModelA(models.Model):
    pass

class ModelB(models.Model):
    pass

class ModelC(models.Model):
    model_a = models.ForeignKey(ModelA, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    model_b = models.ForeignKey(ModelB, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Initialize Django application
    argv = ['manage.py', 'migrate']
    execute_from_command_line(argv)

    # Test code to reproduce the issue
    try:
        query_1 = ModelC.objects.select_related('model_a')
        query_2 = query_1.select_related('model_b')
        
        assert str(query_1.query) != str(query_2.query), "The two queries are the same but should be different"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 indicates issue presence

    # Exiting with code 0 indicates the issue is fixed (or not present)
    print("Success: The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Necessary to add the current file to the INSTALLED_APPS dynamically
    models.signals.class_prepared.connect(lambda sender, **kwargs: setattr(sender._meta, 'app_label', '__main__'), weak=False)

    # Prepare and run the main functionality
    main()
```

This script is structured to accommodate Django's requirements for configuration and model definition before usage. It dynamically configures itself as a Django "app" which allows the defined models (`ModelA`, `ModelB`, `ModelC`) to be recognized by the Django ORM. Consequently, it proceeds to the primary aim: reproducing the reported issue by comparing queries generated after applying `select_related()` successively.

This updated version ensures a proper initialization of the Django application, thereby preventing errors related to models and app registry not being ready. Should the issue be present, it will raise an `AssertionError` with the relevant stack trace. Conversely, if the issue does not manifest, it concludes with a success message and exits with code 0.
