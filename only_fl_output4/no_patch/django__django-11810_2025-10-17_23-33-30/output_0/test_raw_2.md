Given the requirement and the need to ensure an isolated testing environment that interacts properly with Django's ORM system, let's write a standalone `reproducer.py`. This script will explicitly call Django settings setup, ensuring the script can run outside of a Django project structure while still using Django's model and testing facilities.

Please note, since the script assumes no existing Django project structure, some parts of the setup might need adjustments based on specific Django versions and setups. Here's a basic standalone script that attempts to reproduce the described issue:

```python
"""
reproducer.py
Standalone Django script to reproduce the queryset mutation issue
with select_related.
"""

import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.core.management.commands.migrate import Command as MigrateCommand

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            "default": {
                "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
                "NAME": ":memory:",
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            "__main__",  # Register this script as a Django app
        ),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

# Define models
class ModelA(models.Model):
    pass

class ModelB(models.Model):
    pass

class ModelC(models.Model):
    model_a = models.ForeignKey(ModelA, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    model_b = models.ForeignKey(ModelB, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

def perform_migrations():
    MigrateCommand().execute()

def check_query_mutation():
    query_1 = ModelC.objects.select_related('model_a')
    print('QUERY 1:', str(query_1.query))
    query_2 = query_1.select_related('model_b')
    print('QUERY 2:', str(query_2.query))
    print('QUERY 1 Revisited:', str(query_1.query))

    if str(query_1.query) == str(query_2.query):
        raise AssertionError("The two queries are the same but should differ.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_django_environment()
    perform_migrations()
    try:
        check_query_mutation()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the error presence
    else:
        print("Success: The issue is fixed or not present.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success/no error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs several key steps:
- It configures Django settings in an isolated manner.
- It defines models directly within the script, simulating part of a typical Django app's models module.
- It performs database migrations to ensure the models exist in the database (in-memory SQLite in this case).
- It attempts to reproduce the issue as described, by comparing SQL queries generated by chained `select_related` calls.
- It uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print details if the assertion fails, indicating the issue is present.

This script should be run at the root level of a Django project (or wherever it's convenient, provided Django is installed in the environment) using the command:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This should result in an error (exit code 1 with a printout of the issue) if the issue is present, or exit code 0 with a success message if the issue cannot be reproduced or is already fixed.
