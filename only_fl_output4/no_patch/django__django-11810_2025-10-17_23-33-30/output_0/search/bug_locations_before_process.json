        "intended_behavior": "The `select_related` method should ensure that when it returns a new `QuerySet` instance via a call to `_chain`, this new instance maintains independence from the original `QuerySet`. Specifically, modifications to select related fields in the new `QuerySet` should not impact the original `QuerySet`\u2019s selected fields. Essentially, the method should preserve its existing functionality of allowing selective related object querying while ensuring that the returned `QuerySet` is a true, independent clone of the original, unaffected by further operations on the clone."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_clone` method's intended behavior is to create and return a deep copy of the current `QuerySet` that is completely independent of the original. This means any modifications to the clone's conditions, filters, or selected related objects should have no effect on the original `QuerySet`. The method appears to already aim for this with its current implementation; however, ensuring that the `query.chain()` call effectively duplicates the query settings in such a way that further modifications to `query` attributes (such as `select_related` changes) do not reflect back to the originating `QuerySet` is crucial. It might require reinforcing the deep cloning process of the `query` object or evaluating if the `query.chain()` method adequately isolates cloned queries from their originals."
