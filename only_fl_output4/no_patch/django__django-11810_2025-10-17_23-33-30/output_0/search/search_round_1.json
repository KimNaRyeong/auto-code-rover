The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides us valuable insight into the bug related to `QuerySet`'s `select_related` method and its interaction with the `_clone` method.\n\n### 1. Analyzing `select_related` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `select_related` method in the `QuerySet` class is designed to return a new `QuerySet` instance that will select related objects based on the specified ForeignKey fields. If fields are specified, only those related objects are included in the selection. Calling `select_related(None)` will clear the list of related fields to be selected.\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  - The bug description highlights an issue where chaining `select_related` calls mutates the original QuerySet, contrary to the expectation that each call should return a new, independent `QuerySet` instance. The `select_related` method uses `_chain` for creating what is intended to be a new `QuerySet` instance, which should not affect the original.\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  - The intended behavior is that each call to `select_related` would result in a new `QuerySet` that independently maintains its list of fields to be selected. Applying `select_related` on this new `QuerySet` should not alter the state of previously existing `QuerySet` instances.\n\n### 2. Analyzing `_clone` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `_clone` method is intended to return a copy of the current `QuerySet`. It's a lighter alternative to `deepcopy()`, duplicating the `QuerySet` including its model, query, database alias (`_db`), and hints. It also copies other attributes like `_sticky_filter`, `_for_write`, `_prefetch_related_lookups`, `_known_related_objects`, `_iterable_class`, and `_fields`.\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  - Given the issue at hand, it seems the `_clone` method correctly attempts to create a new instance of `QuerySet` with its own copy of the query and other relevant attributes. However, the bug suggests that despite this cloning process, changes in the cloned object via `select_related` still impact the original `QuerySet`, implying the cloning mechanism might not be fully isolating the `QuerySet` instances as intended.\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  - The intended behavior for `_clone` is to produce a completely independent `QuerySet` that can be modified without affecting the original `QuerySet`. This isolation is crucial for ensuring that modifications to cloned `QuerySet`s do not unexpectedly alter others.\n\nFrom the gathered context, it seems both `select_related` and `_clone` are implemented with intentions that align with the expected behavior described in the bug report. Yet, the reported mutation of the original `QuerySet` upon modifying the cloned instance suggests there might be an oversight in how the isolation between cloned objects is maintained. Specifically, considering `select_related` affects the query attribute of the `QuerySet`, and `_clone` creates a new instance with its own query using `query.chain()`, investigating the implementation of `query.chain()` method or how `_clone` manages the linkage of the query attribute between clones could be the next steps to uncover the root cause of the mutation issue."

Specifically, modifications to select related fields in the new `QuerySet` should not impact the original `QuerySet`\u2019s selected fields. Essentially, the method should preserve its existing functionality of allowing selective related object querying while ensuring that the returned `QuerySet` is a true, independent clone of the original, unaffected by further operations on the clone.\n\n   - **Location 2:** \n     - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n     - **Class:** `QuerySet`\n     - **Method:** `_clone`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The `_clone` method's intended behavior is to create and return a deep copy of the current `QuerySet` that is completely independent of the original. This means any modifications to the clone's conditions, filters, or selected related objects should have no effect on the original `QuerySet`. The method appears to already aim for this with its current implementation; however, ensuring that the `query.chain()` call effectively duplicates the query settings in such a way that further modifications to `query` attributes (such as `select_related` changes) do not reflect back to the originating `QuerySet` is crucial. It might require reinforcing the deep cloning process of the `query` object or evaluating if the `query.chain()` method adequately isolates cloned queries from their originals."
