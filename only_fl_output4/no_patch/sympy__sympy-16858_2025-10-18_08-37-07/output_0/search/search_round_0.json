        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to adding missing checks and attributes to various distributions in `sympy.stats`, it would be helpful to understand the structure and current implementation of distributions within the library. Since the issue description does not specify exact classes or methods altered, a broader approach to find relevant files, classes, or snippets would be more appropriate. This would include looking for major classes within the `sympy.stats` module that represents distributions, and identifying common methods where checks might be missing or attributes need to be added.\n\nGiven this approach, let's perform the following API calls for a start:\n\n1. `search_code(\"sympy.stats\")`: This will help in identifying files or parts of code where distributions are primarily defined or implemented.\n2. `search_class(\"Distribution\")`: As many statistical distributions might inherit from a base class or implement an interface for distributions, searching for such a class can give us an insight into the core architecture.\n3. `search_method(\"check\")`: Since the issue mentions missing checks for parameters, searching for `check` method occurrences can reveal where parameter validations are being performed across various distributions."
