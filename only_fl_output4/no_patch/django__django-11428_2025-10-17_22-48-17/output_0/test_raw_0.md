Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue. It attempts to simulate the Django autoreload mechanism and the use of `AppConfig` in a minimal setup without the need for a full Django project structure. This script will check for the specific exception handling issue and output a stack trace if the issue is present, exiting with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., when it detects behavior inconsistent with the reported issue).

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class MyException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, value: str, other_thing: str):
        super().__init__(value)
        self.ot = other_thing

    """

    trying to reconstruct the exception instead of simply re-raising it.
    """
    try:
        # Mimic the problematic behavior
        exc_type = type(exception)
        new_exc = exc_type(exception)
        raise new_exc
    except TypeError as e:
        # If we encounter the TypeError, it indicates the issue is present.
        print("Issue detected: TypeError encountered during exception re-raise.")
        raise AssertionError("Autoreload exception re-raising issue present.") from e
    except MyException as re_raised_exception:
        # If the original exception is re-raised without issue, the issue is fixed.
        print("Original exception: ", re_raised_exception)
        print("No issue detected: Original exception re-raised successfully.")
        sys.exit(0)

def simulate_app_ready():

    """
    raise MyException("foo", "bar")

try:

    try:
        mimic_django_autoreload_raise(e)

        sys.exit(1)

This script primarily detects the exception handling issue in a simulated environment that represents the Django autoreloader behavior. When run, it should exhibit the failure mode described in the issueâ€”if the exception re-raise behavior causes a `TypeError` due to an incorrect assumption about the exception's constructor signature, it will report this via an `AssertionError` and print the related stack trace. If the underlying issue is resolved (i.e., Django or the autoreloader handles the exception correctly), the script should exit normally with code 0, indicating no issue detected.
