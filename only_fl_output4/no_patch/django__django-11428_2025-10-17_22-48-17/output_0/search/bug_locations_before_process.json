        "intended_behavior": "The `raise_last_exception` method should be modified to preserve and re-raise the original exception object directly, rather than attempting to create a new instance of the exception. This change ensures that exceptions with custom signatures (i.e., exceptions requiring more than just the error message as initialization parameters) are re-raised correctly. The method needs to handle exceptions of any signature, maintaining the original information, including arguments passed to its constructor and the traceback. This fix would involve adjusting the method to check if the stored exception (`_exception`) can be re-raised directly, rather than creating a new instance of it. This approach would accommodate the re-raising of exceptions with varying signatures without causing a `TypeError`, thus preserving the existing functionality of the code while fixing the issue described."
