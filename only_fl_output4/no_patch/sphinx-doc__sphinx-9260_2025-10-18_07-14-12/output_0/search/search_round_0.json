        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context around the functionality of the Sphinx linkchecker, especially how it verifies anchor links within HTML documents generated from GitHub-rendered reStructuredText files. Given the detailed description of the problem, specific API calls would be directed towards finding implementation details of the linkchecker, understanding how it recognizes and validates anchors, and identifying any recent changes that could have affected its behavior regarding GitHub's anchor naming convention (`user-content-` prefix).\n\n1. **Search for the LinkChecker class in the codebase:**\nWe can start by looking for a class that could be directly responsible for link checking, such as `CheckExternalLinksBuilder`, or any class name that sounds relevant if `LinkChecker` is not directly available in Sphinx's codebase.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for methods related to link checking within a likely module:**\nAssuming the link checking logic is encapsulated within methods that parse and validate URLs and anchors, we need to find such methods. Potential method names might involve \"check\", \"validate\", \"anchor\", or \"URL\".\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"check_anchor\")\n   search_method(\"validate_url\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for code related to anchor validation or extraction:**\nGiven the specific issue with GitHub-rendered anchors, we should look for code snippets that deal with extracting or validating anchors from URLs. This includes looking for code that manipulates or checks for the presence of the \"user-content-\" prefix.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"user-content-\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are targeted to get a broad yet relevant context around the link checking functionality of Sphinx, with a focus on anchor handling which is central to the reported issue. The collected information would be critical for identifying potential areas for patching to accommodate or properly handle GitHub's anchor format."
