        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

This includes looking for code that manipulates or checks for the presence of the \"user-content-\" prefix.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"user-content-\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are targeted to get a broad yet relevant context around the link checking functionality of Sphinx, with a focus on anchor handling which is central to the reported issue.

Let's delve into the specifics:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the `check_anchor` function**\n- The `check_anchor` function is defined in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`. Its purpose is to determine whether a given HTML anchor exists in a response content by parsing the HTML data received from a URL request.\n- The function employs an `AnchorCheckParser` to parse the HTML content in search of a specified anchor. It reads the response content in chunks to optimize performance, stopping as soon as the anchor is found, which avoids downloading unnecessary data.\n\n### 2. **Relation to the Bug**\n- The bug involves the link checker failing on anchor links that are correctly rendered by GitHub but are prefixed with `user-content-`. This implies an issue in how the `check_anchor` function or its supporting components (like `AnchorCheckParser`) identify and verify anchors in HTML content.\n- The link checker works as expected when explicitly using GitHub's `user-content-` prefixed anchors but fails when the conventional anchor naming without the prefix is used. Given that browsers and GitHub both resolve these URLs correctly, the issue might be within the scope of how `check_anchor` (and related parsing logic) recognizes what constitutes a valid anchor in the context of GitHub's HTML rendering.\n\n### 3. **Intended Behavior**\n- Ideally, the `check_anchor` function should be flexible enough to recognize both conventional anchors and those prefixed by GitHub (i.e., `user-content-`). This means it should successfully verify an anchor's existence regardless of the presence of such a prefix. This adjustment would more accurately reflect real-world browser behavior and GitHub's HTML content structuring.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven this context and the described issue, the following actions could provide additional insights necessary for a potential fix:\n- **Investigate `AnchorCheckParser`**: Understanding how this parser works and what criteria it uses to identify anchors could reveal why the prefix `user-content-` isn't recognized. \n  ```python\n  search_class(\"AnchorCheckParser\")\n  ```\n  \n- **Review How Anchors are Extracted from HTML**: There might be adjustments or enhancements needed in how HTML content is parsed to extract anchors, especially considering GitHub's conventions.\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"parser.feed\")\n  ```\n\n- **Identify Where Anchors are Validated**: It's crucial to find the point in the code where the anchor validity is determined. This might not only be in `check_anchor` but could involve other components; knowing these can help adjust the validation logic to be more inclusive.\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"parser.found\")\n  ```\n\nBy investigating these areas, we aim to gather sufficient context to modify the link checker's behavior to accommodate GitHub's `user-content-` prefix convention without failing valid links."

        "content": "From the collected context, we have a clearer picture of how the `AnchorCheckParser` class and the `check_anchor` function operate within Sphinx's linkcheck.py module. Let's digest the findings:\n\n### 1. **Functionality of the Collected Code Parts**\n\n- **`AnchorCheckParser` Class**: This class inherits from `HTMLParser` and is designed to parse HTML content to search for a specified anchor. The class is initialized with a `search_anchor` argument, which it uses to identify the desired anchor as it parses through HTML content. The `handle_starttag` method is a key part of how this parser identifies start tags of HTML elements, potentially to find anchor elements or IDs that match the `search_anchor`.\n\n- **Usage of `parser.feed` in `check_anchor` Function**: The `check_anchor` function utilizes `parser.feed(chunk)` to parse through chunks of HTML content and determine if the specified anchor exists within that content. This parsing process continues until either the entire content is parsed or the anchor is found (`parser.found`).\n\n### 2. **Relationship to the Bug**\n\n- The issue is that Sphinx's linkchecker fails on GitHub-specific anchors prefixed with `user-content-` while browsers and GitHub support navigating to these anchors without issue. This indicates a potential gap in the `AnchorCheckParser`'s logic or the way `check_anchor` function uses it, where the prefixed anchors are not recognized or handled correctly.\n\n### 3. **Intended Behavior**\n\n- To resolve the bug, the `AnchorCheckParser` and potentially the `check_anchor` function should be adapted to consider the possibility of `user-content-` prefixed anchors. The intended behavior would be that the parser can correctly identify and validate anchors regardless of whether they include this prefix. This means either stripping the prefix before comparison or adjusting the anchor matching logic to account for both prefixed and unprefixed anchor names.\n\nGiven the specific issue with handling GitHub's anchor naming convention, potential improvements could include:\n\n- Enhancing the `AnchorCheckParser` to normalize anchor names by automatically removing the `user-content-` prefix before attempting a match.\n- Modifying the `check_anchor` function to preprocess anchor names, applying normalization logic that considers GitHub's anchor naming scheme.\n\nThis approach would enable the link checker to validate links accurately based on how browsers interpret and navigate to anchors, both with and without the `user-content-` prefix, thus aligning Sphinx's linkchecker functionality closer to real-world usage scenarios."

This normalization process should occur before or during the `handle_starttag` method's operation, ensuring that both prefixed and unprefixed versions of an anchor name can be recognized as valid. Importantly, this change should be done in a way that does not affect the parser's ability to recognize other valid anchors, ensuring that it maintains its original functionality for all other types of anchor names.\n\n   **Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\n   - **Method:** `check_anchor`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The `check_anchor` function may need adjustment to work seamlessly with the updated `AnchorCheckParser`. If the normalization of anchor names (removing or ignoring `user-content-` prefix) is handled within the parser, `check_anchor` may not need significant changes. However, it should be reviewed to ensure that the normalization logic is correctly applied before the parser starts processing the HTML content. This ensures that anchor checking logic remains robust and accurately reflects the behavior of web browsers and GitHub's rendering of anchor links, thus preserving the functionality of linking to the correct parts of a document while accommodating GitHub-specific anchor prefixes."
