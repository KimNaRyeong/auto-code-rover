        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method should accurately handle simplifications involving trigonometric functions with complex arguments. It should ensure that transformations between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions (`cos` to `cosh` and vice versa) correctly incorporate the complex nature of the arguments. Specifically, it should not erroneously transform `cos(pi/6 - I*asinh())` into `cosh(pi/6 + asinh())` without correctly handling the complex part. This might involve checking for complex arguments' properties and applying trigonometric identities correctly to preserve complex numbers' semantics."
