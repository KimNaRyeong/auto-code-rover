Here is the `reproducer.py` file you requested. This script will check the issue with simplification of trigonometric functions with complex arguments in SymPy 1.0, raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is detected. It utilizes the provided function for printing a detailed stack trace when an exception is caught.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_simplification_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, I, sqrt, cos, pi, asinh, cosh, simplify

    # Original expression with the issue
    a = 2*sqrt(2)*I*cos(pi/6 - I*asinh(5*sqrt(2)/2)/3)/3
    a_simplified = simplify(a)

    # Correct simplified form of the expression
    correct_b = 2*sqrt(2)*I*cosh(I*pi/6 + asinh(5*sqrt(2)/2)/3)/3
    correct_b_simplified = simplify(correct_b)

    # Evaluating numerical values
    a_val = a.evalf()
    a_simplified_val = a_simplified.evalf()
    correct_b_simplified_val = correct_b_simplified.evalf()

    # Assert to verify if the issue exists
    try:
        assert a_val == a_simplified_val, "The original expressions did not simplify correctly."
        assert a_val == correct_b_simplified_val, "The corrected expressions did not simplify correctly."
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_simplification_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        # Ensure the script exits with code 1 if an exception occurs
        exit(1)
```

When you run this script with Python 3, it will attempt to perform the problematic simplification and compare the expected and actual numerical results. If the simplified expression's numerical value does not match the original expression's value as expected, it indicates the presence of the issue, triggering the `AssertionError` and printing the stack trace accordingly.
