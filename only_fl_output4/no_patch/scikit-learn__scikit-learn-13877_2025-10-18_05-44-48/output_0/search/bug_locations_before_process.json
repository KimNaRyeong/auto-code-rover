        "intended_behavior": "The method `pairwise_distances` should correctly compute and return the cosine distances when executed in parallel (`n_jobs=-1` or greater than 2). The bug likely resides in how results from parallel computations are aggregated. The intended behavior is to ensure that whether computed in parallel or sequentially (single-threaded execution), the function produces consistent and correct cosine distance matrices. It might be necessary to investigate and possibly revise the aggregation of results in the `_parallel_pairwise` utility function called by `pairwise_distances` for parallel computations. The fix should maintain the correctness of returned values from the function, ensuring that parallel computations with `metric='cosine'` return the accurate floating-point distance matrix, aligning with the sequential (`n_jobs=1`) results.\n\nIt's also noted that using the `euclidean` metric yields integer values instead of floats when executed in parallel, indicating a similar issue where the data type or precision might be incorrectly handled during the result aggregation phase for parallel tasks. The intended behavior here is to ensure that `euclidean` distances retain their floating-point precision in all cases, matching the expected results from sequential computation."
