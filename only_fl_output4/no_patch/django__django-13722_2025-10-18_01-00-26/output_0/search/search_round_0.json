Since the issue suggests adding a method similar to `get_changeform_initial_data` for inline formsets, let's start by locating InlineModelAdmin and examining its current methods:\n\n1. Search for the `InlineModelAdmin` class to understand its current structure and methods.\n2. Since the issue mentions a method similar to `get_changeform_initial_data`, we should search for this method to understand its implementation and figure out where it's used.\n3. Knowing how formsets are currently initialized might also help, so let's search for any code related to formset initialization in `InlineModelAdmin`.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"InlineModelAdmin\")\nsearch_method(\"get_changeform_initial_data\")\nsearch_code(\"formset initialization\")\n```"
