        "content": "To address the issue described, we'll need context around the implementation of the Q object, particularly how the | operator (logical OR) is handled. This will likely involve looking into the Q class implementation and any special methods that handle operator overloading (e.g., `__or__` for |). Given the information from the issue, here are the API calls I will perform:\n\n1. Search for the Q class to understand its structure and definitions. This information is critical to identify methods responsible for operations that involve pickling or where the TypeError might originate from when using the | operator.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Q\")`\n\n2. Since the issue specifically occurs when applying the | operator, we need to locate the implementation of this operator within the Q class. The | operator in Python objects is typically implemented via the `__or__` method, so we'll search for that in the Q class.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")`\n\n3. Given the nature of the error, it might also be useful to understand how the Q object handles the `x__in` operation. This might not directly involve the | operator but could provide insights into how dict_keys objects are managed internally, which could influence the approach to handling them in | operations.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Q\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point to understand the underlying causes of the bug and guide the next steps in developing a patch."
