Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can place in the root directory of your project. This script attempts to reproduce the described issue. When executed, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (indicating that the problem could be successfully reproduced). If the issue is fixed, the script should exit gracefully with exit code 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from django.db.models import Q
    try:
        # Assuming the issue occurs when applying | operator to a Q object with dict_keys
        result = Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        # If the code reaches this point without exceptions, it means the issue has been fixed.
        print("Issue has been fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

To run this script, ensure you have Django set up correctly in your environment, as the script imports from `django.db.models`. This setup would typically involve having a Django project setup with a valid settings module configured. Otherwise, you might encounter import errors or issues related to Django being unable to find its configuration.

This script strictly follows your criteria, using the provided function to print the stack trace clearly and handling the specific case of applying the bitwise OR operation (`|`) to a `Q` object that contains a non-pickleable type (`dict_keys`, in this case).
