        "intended_behavior": "When the `ci` parameter is explicitly set to `None`, the function should issue a warning to the user indicating that the usage of `ci=None` is deprecated or being phased out in favor of explicitly using `errorbar=None`. Following this warning, the function should internally handle the scenario as if `errorbar=None` were passed to ensure consistency with the intended new behavior. This modification should preserve the existing functionality of handling `ci` and `errorbar` parameters but enhance the user feedback mechanism and future-proof the argument handling mechanism."
