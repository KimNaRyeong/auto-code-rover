Modifications should ensure that terms differentiated only by case (MySQL vs mysql) are not flagged as duplicates. Adjustments could include setting case_sensitive options if available, or applying custom sorting or merging logic for glossary terms within the Sphinx build process. Any changes must maintain the overall functionality of the documentation build process, including preserving the distinction between terms where case differences are meaningful and relevant to the content, and ensuring that all glossary terms remain accessible and correctly rendered in the final documentation output."
