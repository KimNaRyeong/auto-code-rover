Specifically, it adds 2000 to years less than 70 and 1900 to years between 70 and 99, implying that it perceives years 00 to 69 as 2000 to 2069 and years 70 to 99 as 1970 to 1999 respectively.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue described is with this exact logic of handling two-digit years. The bug report highlights that this approach does not follow the guidelines provided by RFC 7231 regarding the interpretation of two-digit years. The RFC specifies that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits. The current logic, however, statically translates two-digit years without considering the current year, potentially leading to incorrect interpretations.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior should involve dynamic computation based on the current year. Instead of statically converting years based on the threshold of 70, it should dynamically adjust two-digit years by considering whether the resulting year is more than 50 years in the future from the current year. If so, it should reinterpret that year to signify the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\nGiven these insights, a patch must revise the logic within this specific block of code to bring the functionality in line with RFC 7231. Incorporating a dynamic check relative to the current year to decide how to interpret two-digit years would resolve the issue. To craft a precise solution, further context might be needed, specifically regarding how the current year is accessed within the Django codebase and performing calculations based on the current year. \n\nA possible next step could involve:\n- Searching for code snippets on how Django projects typically access the current year, ensuring the solution aligns with Django conventions and practices.\n- Adjusting the logic in the identified code block to comply with the mentioned RFCs' requirements, incorporating a comparison versus the current year to determine how to handle years perceived to be in the future."

This adjustment involves dynamically determining the century of a two-digit year based on the current year. If a two-digit year, when interpreted as being in the 20th or 21st century, appears to be more than 50 years in the future, it should instead be interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n  - Specifically, this means replacing the simplistic check that statically assigns a century to a two-digit year, with a more sophisticated logic that:\n    1. Retrieves the current year.\n    2. Compares the two-digit year with the last two digits of the current year.\n    3. If the computed year (with the century assumed as 1900 or 2000 added) is over 50 years ahead of the current year, it should instead treat it as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n  - This change ensures compliance with RFC 7231 and addresses potential misinterpretations of two-digit years, thereby resolving the stated issue."
