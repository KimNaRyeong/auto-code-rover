Therefore, the appropriate API calls to make would involve searching for this specific function within the django codebase to retrieve the relevant code snippet and analyze the current implementation.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. search_method(\"parse_http_date\") - This will help in finding the implementation of the mentioned method in the entire codebase.\n\n2. search_code(\"0-69 to be in 2000-2069, and 70-99 to be 1970-1999\") - Since the issue description explicitly mentions the logic that's being criticized, searching for this specific code snippet can quickly lead us to the problematic section of the code."
