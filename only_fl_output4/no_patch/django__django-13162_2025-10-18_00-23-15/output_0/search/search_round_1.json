For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's piece together how it relates to the issue at hand and plan our next steps accordingly.\n\n1. **Classes Named `Migration` in the Codebase**:\n   - **What it does**: The classes named `Migration` likely define the structure and behaviour of database migrations. They may include metadata, dependencies, and the operations to apply to the database.\n   - **Relationship with the bug**: The root issue concerns the filenames of merge migrations. While the specific class responsible for generating these filenames hasn't been identified yet, it is reasonable to assume it may either directly be part of, or interact with, the `Migration` class or a similar utility within the migration system.\n   - **Intended behavior**: These classes should eventually lead us to the point where merge migrations are handled\u2014specifically, where their filenames are generated.\n\n2. **No Method Found for `create_merge_filename` and Results for `merge`**:\n   - **What it does**: The non-existence of a method explicitly named `create_merge_filename` indicates that merge migration filename creation is likely handled within a method with a different name, possibly as part of a general migration file naming function. The `merge` methods found might not directly relate to migrations but might show how 'merge' operations are generally labeled or triggered in various contexts.\n   - **Relationship with the bug**: Without direct hits for filename generation, understanding the broader context of 'merge' operations can still provide indirect clues about conventions or utility functions that might be involved in the process we're interested in.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The anticipated connection would involve finding how these merge operations tie back into migration management, directly or through associated utility functions.\n\n3. **Code Containing `merge_` and `timestamp`**:\n   - **What it does**: These snippets, especially those in `makemigrations.py`, are likely directly involved in the naming convention of migrations, including the process of naming merge migrations.\n   - **Relationship with the bug**: Given the issue's discussion around changing the naming convention from timestamp-based to a more descriptive approach involving the merged file names, analyzing these portions of the code will likely lead us to the logic that needs altering.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The code blocks that reference `merge_` and `timestamp` may contain the logic for generating migration filenames. Modifying this logic according to the issue description will involve identifying how filenames are currently constructed and devising a method to include the names of the migrations being merged.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the initial search results, the next logical steps are:\n\n- Examine the code related to migrations within `django/db/migrations/migration.py` and `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` closely. Since these files appear in the context of both class definitions and code snippets relevant to migration naming and timestamp usage, they are likely candidates for containing the filename generation logic.\n- Specifically, `makemigrations.py` stands out due to its association with generating migration files. It's logical to concentrate on this file for clues on how filenames are generated and how they could be modified to adhere to the suggested naming scheme.\n\nTo get more context on how filenames are generated, especially for merge migrations, the following additional API calls should be considered:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"makemigrations\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"filename\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Since specific methods were not identified in the initial search, the function(s) in question are those which implement or call logic to generate the filename for merge migrations.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Modify or extend the logic within this file to generate merge migration filenames based on the names of the migrations being merged, rather than simply using a timestamp. This involves constructing a filename that reflects the content of the merge (i.e., the specific migrations that are being combined). For instance, when merging migrations `0002_conflicting_second` and `0002_second`, the merge migration's filename should look something like `0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py`. This behavior preserves the existing functionality by still uniquely identifying migration files with sequential prefixes (e.g., `0003_`), while enhancing clarity by specifying the source migrations involved in the merge in the filename itself. This approach improves the understandability of migration files, particularly in larger projects where tracking the purpose and content of migrations through filenames can significantly streamline development and debugging processes.\n\nThis proposed change directly addresses the issue by incorporating informative elements (names of the specific migrations being merged) into the filenames of merge migrations, enhancing the transparency and utility of migration filenames in Django project development."
