This could involve scrutinizing the steps following the invocation of `enet_path` within `fit` that translate the output `coefs` into `self.coef_`, ensuring the shape is always consistent with the expected dimensions, independent of the intercept fitting."

        "method": "enet_path",
        "intended_behavior": "Within `enet_path`, careful examination and adjustment are necessary to ensure that the computation and return of coefficient shapes correctly account for `fit_intercept=False`. It's essential to verify that when `enet_path` is called, the resulting coefficients' shape is consistent, whether or not an intercept term is accounted for in the model. This might involve adjusting how `coefs` are initialized and manipulated based on the `fit_intercept` parameter, to maintain dimensionality consistency across different configurations."
