        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, I need to understand how the `Lasso` class is implemented, specifically how it handles the `fit_intercept` flag and how it computes and assigns the `coef_`. Here are the searches that would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Lasso` class definition to understand its structure and to find any relevant methods that might deal with fitting the model and setting the `coef_` attribute.\n2. Search for the `fit` method within the `Lasso` class, as that is where the logic for fitting the model to the data occurs, and likely where the shape of `coef_` is determined based on `fit_intercept`.\n3. Since the description mentions a comparison case with `fit_intercept=True` working as expected, it could be helpful to see if there's distinct handling based on this flag in the code.\n\nLet's formulate the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Lasso\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `Lasso` class is defined, which is essential for understanding how it's implemented.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"Lasso\")`:This will provide details on how the fitting process is handled within the `Lasso` class, specifically looking at how `coef_` is shaped and whether `fit_intercept=False` is considered during this process."
