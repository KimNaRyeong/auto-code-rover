It looks like you're asking for a corrected version of the standalone `reproducer.py` script under the scenario that it should properly handle the exception case and make sure the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed or properly handled. Please note, the error you encountered seems related to an installation issue with scikit-learn rather than the script itself. However, I'll ensure the script includes a proper exit code handling as per your request.

Given the context, I will adjust the script to include better error handling and to ensure it exits with code 0 when the issue represented by the assertion error is resolved, or more generally, if the script runs to completion without encountering assertion failures.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn import linear_model

        # Case with intercept
        est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
        est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,)
        print("Intercept case passed.")

        # Case without intercept
        est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Shape of `coef_` is wrong"
        print("No-intercept case passed.")
    except ImportError as e:
        print("ImportError encountered. Please ensure scikit-learn is correctly installed.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(-1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("AssertionError encountered.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(-1)

    # If script reaches here, no issues were found.
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This adjusted version of `reproducer.py` includes a broad try-except block to catch both `ImportError`, which relates to the issue you've faced with the sklearn installation, and `AssertionError` for the specific test case failure, and other unexpected exceptions. Each block handles the error by printing a helpful message and a stack trace for debugging. The script ensures an exit code of 0 is used when the script concludes without encountering issues, thereby fulfilling your requirement.
