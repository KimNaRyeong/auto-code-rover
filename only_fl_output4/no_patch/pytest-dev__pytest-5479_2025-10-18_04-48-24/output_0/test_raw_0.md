```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_u():
    import pytest

    with pytest.raises(AssertionError, match=u"\u2603"):
        assert False, u"\u2603"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_u()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the script executed fully
```

Please note that the script expects the `pytest` module to be installed in your Python environment. If it's not already installed, you can install it using the following command:

```shell
pip install pytest
```

Running `python3 reproducer.py` with the described setup will execute `test_u`. The expected behavior is to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue occurs, and the `print_stacktrace()` function is designed to print a detailed stack trace of the issue for debugging purposes. 

This script is written with Python 3 syntax and handling in mind. Since the original issue pertains to Python 2's handling of Unicode with pytest, do note that Python 3 has much improved Unicode handling, which should generally prevent this type of error from occurring.
