        "content": "To address the issue, it seems we need to understand how the `pytest.raises` method is being used and how it handles the `match` argument, especially in Python 2 environments where Unicode handling can be problematic. The error shown (`UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\u2603' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)`) points towards an encoding issue when Python attempts to handle a Unicode string. Given this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the usage and definition of `pytest.raises`:** This will help us understand how `pytest.raises` is implemented and how it handles the `match` parameter, which seems to be where the Unicode handling issue originates.\n   \n2. **Search for any utility or helper functions that might be involved in Unicode string processing or Encoding handling within the context of assert statements or exceptions:** If there's specific logic to handle Unicode strings or encode/decode operations, it will be useful to know.\n\nSince the issue is clearly within the context of a test case using `pytest.raises`, our search will focus around these areas:\n\n- `search_method('pytest.raises')`: To get an overview of where and how `raises` is defined or used across the project, which might lead us to the implementation.\n- `search_code('assertionError, match=')`: Assuming that this pattern might be utilized not only in the provided example but also in similar contexts within the project, understanding its usage could provide insights into common practices around assertion handling and Unicode string matching in the project.\n\nThese API calls are chosen to provide comprehensive context around both the specific use case and broader practices within the project that might influence the resolution of the reported issue."
