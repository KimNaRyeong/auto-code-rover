        "content": "To address the issue, it seems we need to understand how the `pytest.raises` method is being used and how it handles the `match` argument, especially in Python 2 environments where Unicode handling can be problematic. The error shown (`UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\u2603' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)`) points towards an encoding issue when Python attempts to handle a Unicode string. Given this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the usage and definition of `pytest.raises`:** This will help us understand how `pytest.raises` is implemented and how it handles the `match` parameter, which seems to be where the Unicode handling issue originates.\n   \n2. **Search for any utility or helper functions that might be involved in Unicode string processing or Encoding handling within the context of assert statements or exceptions:** If there's specific logic to handle Unicode strings or encode/decode operations, it will be useful to know.\n\nSince the issue is clearly within the context of a test case using `pytest.raises`, our search will focus around these areas:\n\n- `search_method('pytest.raises')`: To get an overview of where and how `raises` is defined or used across the project, which might lead us to the implementation.\n- `search_code('assertionError, match=')`: Assuming that this pattern might be utilized not only in the provided example but also in similar contexts within the project, understanding its usage could provide insights into common practices around assertion handling and Unicode string matching in the project.\n\nThese API calls are chosen to provide comprehensive context around both the specific use case and broader practices within the project that might influence the resolution of the reported issue."

        "content": "Given that we didn't find direct references or uses of `pytest.raises` or `AssertionError, match=` in the codebase, our approach needs to be adjusted. The problem might not lie with how `pytest.raises` itself is implemented or directly used within the codebase since it's a part of the pytest framework, but rather with how Unicode strings are handled or encoded in the context where pytest's assertion mechanisms are used, particularly when exceptions are caught and matched against patterns.\n\nSince the issue clearly involves Unicode handling and we know that Python 2 has different Unicode handling capabilities compared to Python 3, it might be fruitful to investigate how the project deals with exceptions and encodings, especially in test files which might not directly modify or extend the `pytest.raises` functionality but use it in a way that triggers the bug.\n\nReflecting on this, we should focus on a few different areas:\n\n1. **Unicode and encoding handling in Python 2 within the project:** Given the nature of the issue, it's worth looking into how the project handles Unicode strings and encodings, especially in the context of assertions within tests. This might shed light on practices or utility functions that are relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **Custom wrappers or utilities around assertions or pytest functionalities:** Since direct references to `pytest.raises` weren't found, it's possible that the project uses wrappers or utility functions that internally use pytest functionalities, including exception handling and assertions.\n\nThus, the next steps in our investigation could involve:\n\n- **Looking for any encoding or decoding functions:** Since encoding issues are at the heart of the matter, finding utility functions that handle encoding might provide insights.\n  \n- **Searching for custom assertion functions or exception handling utilities:** These might abstract away the direct usage of `pytest.raises` and might be where the issue needs fixing.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls could be helpful:\n\n- `search_code('encode')`: To find any explicit encoding operations that might give insights into how Unicode strings are customarily handled.\n- `search_code('decode')`: Similarly, to see if there's any manual decoding that could interact poorly with Python 2's default ASCII encoding.\n- `search_code('assert ')`: Since the issue is related to asserting with a Unicode match, looking for custom assertion patterns might be useful.\n- `search_code('with pytest.raises')`: While we didn't find `pytest.raises` directly, searching for its usage context might still offer clues, especially in wrapped or utility functions.\n\nThese calls are aimed at circling around the problem area from different angles, hopefully shedding light on the code patterns and practices that led to the reported issue."
