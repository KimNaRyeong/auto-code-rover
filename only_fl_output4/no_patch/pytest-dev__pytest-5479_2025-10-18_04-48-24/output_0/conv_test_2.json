Given that you mentioned the script being run with `python3 reproducer.py`, note that the original issue pertains to Python 2 behavior, particularly the handling (or mishandling) of Unicode and the default ASCII codec which can lead to a `UnicodeEncodeError` when non-ASCII characters are involved.\n\nThe `print_stacktrace` function will clearly show where the issue originates if it fails due to a Unicode-related problem. However, since the script implicitly requires `pytest` to run the test function as intended, just executing it with a Python interpreter won't directly run the test in a normal `pytest` testing environment. Thus, under normal circumstances, running this file with `python3` won't behave as it might inside a `pytest`-controlled environment unless adapted for standalone execution.\n\nFor a script intended to be executed outside the pytest environment that still demonstrates the behavior (raising an `AssertionError` with a Unicode message), one would typically directly call the function intended for testing or simulate the `pytest` behavior manually, which could complicate the reproducibility of the environment-specific issue. Remember to install pytest and adjust the script for an environment that mimics the original issue's conditions as closely as possible if attempting to reproduce environment-specific issues."
