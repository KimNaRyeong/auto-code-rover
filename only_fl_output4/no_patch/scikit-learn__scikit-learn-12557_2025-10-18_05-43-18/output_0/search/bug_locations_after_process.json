Given its direct influence on how `decision_function` operates, especially for OvR scenarios, ensuring this function's tie-breaking logic is transparent and mirrored by the `predict` method is crucial. The tie-breaking mechanism here should follow a predefined, consistent rule (e.g., selecting the smallest class label in case of ties) that `predict` either implicitly respects or explicitly applies. This modification will address the consistency issue raised, ensuring both `decision_function` and `predict` output the same class predictions under tied conditions."
