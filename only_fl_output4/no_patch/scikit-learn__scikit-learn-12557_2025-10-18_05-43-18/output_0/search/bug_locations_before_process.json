        "intended_behavior": "The `decision_function` within the `SVC` class should actively include a consistent tie-breaking mechanism that aligns with the `predict` method. Since the issue specifies a disparity in the handling of ties, the method's modification should ensure that the final output (i.e., chosen class) from `decision_function` mirrors the output of `predict` when ties are encountered. This may involve either revising how `decision_function` evaluates ties, ensuring it uses a standardized or configurable approach that `predict` can also utilize, or ensuring `predict` leverages `decision_function`'s outcomes directly or indirectly to maintain consistency."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_ovr_decision_function`, as identified, involves computing a continuous, tie-breaking OvR decision function. Given its direct influence on how `decision_function` operates, especially for OvR scenarios, ensuring this function's tie-breaking logic is transparent and mirrored by the `predict` method is crucial. The tie-breaking mechanism here should follow a predefined, consistent rule (e.g., selecting the smallest class label in case of ties) that `predict` either implicitly respects or explicitly applies. This modification will address the consistency issue raised, ensuring both `decision_function` and `predict` output the same class predictions under tied conditions."
