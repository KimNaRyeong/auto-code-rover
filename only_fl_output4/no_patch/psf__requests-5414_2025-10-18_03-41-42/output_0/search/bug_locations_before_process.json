        "intended_behavior": "In the `prepare_url` method, specifically around the lines where IDNA encoding of the host part of the URL is attempted (lines 401-407), the intended behavior is to catch `UnicodeError` and re-raise it as an `InvalidURL` exception with a message indicating that the URL has an invalid label. This change will ensure that users receive a consistent and informative error message that adheres to the expected handling of URL validation within the library, maintaining the overall functionality of accurately preparing and validating URLs before an HTTP request is made. The core functionality of IDNA encoding and URL validation remains, but with an additional layer of error handling to catch and translate `UnicodeError` into a more descriptive and expected exception type, thus resolving the issue described."
