Given that the initial attempt to reproduce the issue did not correctly capture the expected outcome and considering the provided guidelines, the script `reproducer.py` needs to properly differentiate between the expected `InvalidURL` exception and other potential issues, such as `UnicodeError` or environment-specific errors. Rewriting the script with this in mind and ensuring correct exception handling might help in correctly reproducing the described issue. Let's revise the script accordingly.

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests
from requests.exceptions import InvalidURL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    url = "http://.example.com"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        # If the request does not raise an exception, it means the issue is likely fixed or not present.
        print(f"Request to {url} succeeded, which is unexpected for this test.")
    except InvalidURL as e:
        # This is the expected result based on the issue description.
        print("InvalidURL exception caught as expected. Issue appears to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except UnicodeError as e:
        # The situation described in the issue where a UnicodeError is raised instead of InvalidURL.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("UnicodeError occurred instead of InvalidURL. The issue is present.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other exception that might be raised, which is not expected.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError(f"An unexpected exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 indicates that the issue is present or another unexpected situation occurred.
    exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 indicates that the issue has been fixed or the test succeeded.
```

This rewritten version captures both expected `InvalidURL` exceptions and unexpected `UnicodeError` instances, accordingly reacting by either marking the test as successful (if `InvalidURL` is caught as expected) or failing the test (if `UnicodeError` is encountered or if any other unexpected exception occurs). Please make sure that the test environment is correctly set up with all necessary dependencies and that the version of the `requests` library being used is consistent with the one reported in the issue.
