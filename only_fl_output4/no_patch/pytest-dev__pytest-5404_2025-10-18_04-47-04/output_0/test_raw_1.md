Given the adjustment needed, understanding that the initial script did not reproduce the issue potentially because it might not have accurately simulated the environment or conditions under which the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` occurs, a revised attempt is needed. This particular error could be intricately related to how `pytest` interacts with the importing of modules, especially around decorators and wrapped functions which might not be straightforward to replicate outside its ecosystem.

However, focusing on simulating an environment closer to `pytest`, we can introduce a mock setup that imitates the wrapping/unwrapping of attributes that `pytest` might perform during collection and setup phases. Here's a more focused approach:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_pytest_behavior():
    try:
        # Attempting to replicate a scenario similar to what happens under pytest that could result in '__wrapped__' KeyError
        # Note: This is a simplified simulation. The actual issue might stem from a more complex interaction.
        
        class MockFunctionWrapper(object):
            def __init__(self, function):
                self.__wrapped__ = function

        def problematic_function():
            print("This function does nothing problematic on its own.")

        wrapped_function = MockFunctionWrapper(problematic_function)

        # Mimicking pytest's inspection that triggers the error
        if hasattr(wrapped_function, '__wrapped__'):
            unwrapped_func = getattr(wrapped_function, '__wrapped__')
            unwrapped_func()  # Invoke to simulate further interaction that might trigger the KeyError in a real scenario.

        # The script should raise an AssertionError if it doesn't encounter the expected error condition,
        # implying it has failed to replicate the reported issue.
        return True

    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False  # Indicating the occurrence of the expected KeyError.
    except Exception as unexpected_e:
        # Any unexpected exception types encountered would be indicative of an incorrect reproduction attempt.
        print(f"Unexpected exception type encountered: {unexpected_e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = simulate_pytest_behavior()
    assert not result, "The simulation didn't encounter the expected KeyError. It might not accurately reproduce the reported issue."
    if result:
        print("The issue was not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        print("The KeyError issue was successfully simulated.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate success in reproducing the issue.
```

This script attempts to create a minimal reproducible setup that could potentially lead to the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` when a function or object attribute is unwrapped, simulating the behavior observed with `pytest`. It introduces a mock wrapper to replicate the conditions under which the error could manifest, focusing on attribute wrapping and unwrapping, a process often encountered in testing frameworks and decorators.

Please adjust the specifics of the simulated behavior (e.g., the function or object wrapping/unwrapping) based on more detailed understanding of the original context or environment in which the error occurs, as the exact replication might require more specific conditions to trigger the `KeyError`.
