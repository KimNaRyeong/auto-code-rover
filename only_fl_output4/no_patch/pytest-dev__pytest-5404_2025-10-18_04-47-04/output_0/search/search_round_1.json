The problem arises when using `from xxx import yyy` in the context of running `tox` or `pytest`, where the failure is specifically noted to occur if the import `from sty import fg` is not commented out in the project. Additionally, an error occurs during the collection phase of testing with `pytest`, which suggests it might be related to test discovery or execution, potentially involving decorators or wrappers used in the code or tests.\n\nTo begin with, we should first look into how and where `fg` from `sty` is used within the project files, since removing or commenting out this import is mentioned as a workaround to avoid the KeyError. We also need to understand if there's any custom logic around `unwrap` or handling of `__wrapped__` attributes directly that might lead to the error. Moreover, looking at how tests are collected or executed might offer insights, as the error is reported during `pytest` test collection.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls:\n1. search_code(\"from sty import fg\"): This will help us find all instances where `fg` from `sty` is imported, which is directly related to the scenario described in the issue.\n2. search_code(\"__wrapped__\"): Since the KeyError revolves around the `__wrapped__`, it's essential to find occurrences of this attribute to understand its usage and potential misuse in the codebase.\n\nThese searches are aimed at gathering context around the usage patterns causing the issue and any direct references to the attribute mentioned in the error."

        "content": "The results from the search API calls provide a pivotal direction for troubleshooting the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'`.\n\n### Analysis of the Search Results\n\n#### \"from sty import fg\" Not Found in the Codebase\nThis result is quite intriguing because the issue description mentions that commenting out `from sty import fg` mitigates the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'`. Since this import statement could not be found, it suggests either a misunderstanding in the issue description or that the import statement is dynamically constructed or executed in a non-conventional manner.\n\n#### Occurrences of `__wrapped__`\nThe fact that `__wrapped__` was mentioned in two specific files (`testing/python/integration.py` and `src/_pytest/compat.py`) is significant. Given that `__wrapped__` is a feature typically associated with decorators (especially those used for wrapping functions for additional functionality while preserving the original function's metadata), its presence in these files suggests they are involved in either test integration or compatibility layers that might interact with decorators.\n\n1. **`testing/python/integration.py` (3 matches)**\n   - **What It Does:** This file probably deals with integrating various Python components or features for testing purposes. The presence of `__wrapped__` might indicate it's dealing with decorated functions\u2014either to unwrap them for introspection or to modify behavior for testing.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug:** The error happens during test collection, which could involve code in this file as it might be inspecting or modifying test functions.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, any interaction with `__wrapped__` should gracefully handle cases where this attribute is absent to avoid `KeyError`s. Handling or checking for the existence of `__wrapped__` should be done cautiously.\n\n2. **`src/_pytest/compat.py` (2 matches)**\n   - **What It Does:** Compatibility files often include shims or utilities to bridge differences between Python versions or smooth over edge cases. Usage of `__wrapped__` here could serve to make function wrapping and unwrapping behaves uniformly across different Python versions.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug:** If the bug is triggered by an attempt to unwind or inspect a wrapped function and `compat.py` is involved in such a process, incorrect or overly aggressive access to `__wrapped__` without checking its existence could lead to the described `KeyError`.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The code should robustly handle the absence of `__wrapped__`, perhaps by using `getattr` with a default value, or checking its presence before access.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above analysis, more detailed context around how `__wrapped__` is used in both files is necessary. Specifically, understanding how test functions are being handled could shed light on the mechanism leading to the `KeyError`. To achieve this, the following API calls are proposed:\n\n1. search_code_in_file(\"`__wrapped__`\", \"testing/python/integration.py\"): To get precise snippets where `__wrapped__` is used, offering insight into potential points that could cause the bug.\n2. search_code_in_file(\"`__wrapped__`\", \"src/_pytest/compat.py\"): Similar to the first call but focused on compatibility layers, potentially uncovering how `__wrapped__` is managed across different scenarios, including error handling or access mechanisms that might contribute to the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Locations:\n\n   - **Location 1: File: testing/python/integration.py**\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The code that accesses `__wrapped__` should first check if the attribute exists. This could be implemented by either using `getattr` with a default value or explicitly checking the presence of the `__wrapped__` attribute on an object before accessing it. This adjustment is necessary to prevent `KeyError` when the attribute is not present on an object that is being inspected during the test collection or execution process. The existing functionality, which likely aims to introspect or modify test functions (potentially for unwrapping decorators), should be preserved while making it robust against the absence of `__wrapped__`.\n   \n   - **Location 2: File: src/_pytest/compat.py**\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The code related to function unwrapping or manipulation that uses `__wrapped__` should implement safer access patterns. As in the previous location, using `getattr(obj, '__wrapped__', default)` or a similar check will ensure that `KeyError` is not raised. This file's role in smoothing over compatibility issues suggests it might be dealing with a variety of Python versions and their nuances in handling wrapped functions. Thus, enhancing robustness here is crucial. The amendment should not alter the core functionality intended by these compatibility layers but should ensure they are fault-tolerant to differences in object attributes, particularly `__wrapped__`.\n   \nThese changes aim to mitigate the occurrence of `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` by introducing checks before attempting to access `__wrapped__`, ensuring that the code gracefully handles scenarios where this attribute is absent."
