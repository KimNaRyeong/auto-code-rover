If the child class has the `__init__` method (using typed parameters) and I try to reassign the attribute from `Generic` class I got the following error:\n```text\nWARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:dry-python/returns.git\n$ cd returns\n$ poetry install\n$ cd docs\n$ poetry run make html\n```\nCode example:\n* Python script\n```python\nfrom typing import (\nClassVar,\nType,\nTypeVar,\nGeneric,\n)\n_ValueType = TypeVar('_ValueType')\nclass MyGeneric(Generic[_ValueType]):\n#: Doc comment example.\nsome_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\nclass MyGenericChild(MyGeneric[_ValueType]):\ndef __init__(self, inner_value: _ValueType) -> None:\npass\nMyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\n```\n* rst\n```rst\n.. test:\nTest\n====\n.. automodule:: lib.test\n:members:\n```\nIf you try to modify something in the script maybe the error will not appear, it's a very specific corner case!\n**Expected behavior**\nThe warning should not appear!\n**Your project**\n[returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux 5.7.9-1-MANJARO\n- Python version: 3.8.3\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:\n```text\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\nsphinx.ext.doctest\nsphinx.ext.todo\nsphinx.ext.coverage\nsphinx.ext.viewcode\nsphinx.ext.autosummary\nsphinx.ext.napoleon\nm2r\nsphinx_autodoc_typehints\nsphinxcontrib.mermaid\nhoverxref.extension\n```\n---\nrelated issue https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/568\n</issue>"

Since the issue describes a problem that arises during Sphinx documentation generation, specifically with automodule documentation of these classes, we should ensure we're looking at how these classes are documented, along with their implementation.\n\nBased on the issue description, here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `MyGeneric` class definition in the codebase** to understand its structure and any doc comments associated with it, which might be causing the Sphinx warning:\n   - `search_class(\"MyGeneric\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `MyGenericChild` class definition in the codebase** to see how it extends `MyGeneric` and how its `__init__` method and attributes are documented:\n   - `search_class(\"MyGenericChild\")`\n\n3. **Search for any specific mentions of `MyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild` assignment** to see where and how this reassignment is done in the codebase, which might be relevant since the issue specifically mentions this reassignment:\n   - `search_code(\"MyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\")`\n\nThese API calls will help understand the general implementation and documentation approach for these classes in the project and potentially identify what might be causing the Sphinx documentation generation to emit a warning."
