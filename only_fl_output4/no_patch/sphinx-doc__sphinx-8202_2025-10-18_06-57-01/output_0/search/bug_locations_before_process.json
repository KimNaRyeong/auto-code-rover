The configurations, especially those related to extensions like autodoc and autosummary, might need fine-tuning to handle doc comments for generic classes without triggering warnings. Ensure that any custom settings or extensions related to documentation parsing explicitly support or correctly handle the structuring of doc comments on attributes within generic classes. The intended behavior is to maintain existing documentation generation capabilities while eliminating the generation of formatting-related warnings."

Modifications might be needed to explicitly handle or better support doc comments on generic class attributes. This could include adjusting parsing logic to correctly interpret field lists within these contexts or providing configuration options that allow users to specify how such comments should be treated. The aim is again to preserve the functionality of automatic documentation generation while ensuring it does not misinterpret or incorrectly format comments, avoiding warnings."
