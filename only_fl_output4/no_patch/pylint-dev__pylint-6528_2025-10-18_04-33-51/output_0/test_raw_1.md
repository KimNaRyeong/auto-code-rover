To address the error you encountered, it's essential to ensure that the `pylint` command is installed in the environment where this script is run. The error you're seeing suggests that `pylint` was not found in the script's execution environment. Make sure `pylint` is installed and available in your system's PATH, or adjust the script to call the specific path to `pylint` if it's installed in a non-standard location.

Below is a revised version of the script that makes an explicit check for the `pylint` executable's presence. It will provide a more instructive error message if `pylint` is missing. Note that this script assumes `pylint` can be called directly from the command line (i.e., it is in the system's PATH). Adjust the `PYLINT_COMMAND` variable if you need to specify a full path to `pylint`.

from typing import List


PYLINT_COMMAND = 'pylint'

    )
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    if process.returncode not in (0, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32):
        # Pylint exit codes 0, and any combination of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 for different issue types
        raise Exception(f"Pylint execution failed with code {process.returncode}: {stderr}")
    return stdout + stderr

This script, `reproducer.py`, will first verify that `pylint` is installed by attempting to run `pylint --version`. If this check fails, it will print an error message indicating that `pylint` must be installed and accessible. Assuming `pylint` is correctly set up, the script will proceed to setup test files and run various pylint commands to test whether the ignore settings are functioning as expected. If the script detects the issues described, it will raise an `AssertionError`; otherwise, it will finish by stating no issues were detected.
