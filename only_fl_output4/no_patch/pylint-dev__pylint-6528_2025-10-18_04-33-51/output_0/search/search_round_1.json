This contradicts the documentation and seriously compromises the usefulness of recursive mode.\n### Configuration\n_No response_\n### Command used\n```shell\n### .a/foo.py\n# import re\n### bar.py\n# import re\npylint --recursive=y .\npylint --recursive=y --ignore=.a .\npylint --recursive=y --ignore-paths=.a .\npylint --recursive=y --ignore-patterns=\"^\\.a\" .\n```\n### Pylint output\nAll of these commands give the same output:\n```\n************* Module bar\nbar.py:1:0: C0104: Disallowed name \"bar\" (disallowed-name)\nbar.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)\nbar.py:1:0: W0611: Unused import re (unused-import)\n************* Module foo\n.a/foo.py:1:0: C0104: Disallowed name \"foo\" (disallowed-name)\n.a/foo.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)\n.a/foo.py:1:0: W0611: Unused import re (unused-import)\n```\n### Expected behavior\n`foo.py` should be ignored by all of the above commands, because it is in an ignored directory (even the first command with no ignore setting should skip it, since the default value of `ignore-patterns` is `\"^\\.\"`.\nFor reference, the docs for the various ignore settings from `pylint --help`:\n```\n--ignore=<file>[,<file>...]\nFiles or directories to be skipped. They should be\nbase names, not paths. [current: CVS]\n--ignore-patterns=<pattern>[,<pattern>...]\nFiles or directories matching the regex patterns are\nskipped.

Thus, focusing on specific parts of pylint that deal with these functionalities will be essential. Here are the API calls I would make to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the code or method that handles the `--recursive` argument. This could be in command-line parsing or within a configuration setup method, as it seems central to the issue.\n2. Search for the methods or classes that process the `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` options since the issue mentions that pylint is not respecting these settings in recursive mode.\n3.

This could mean that the recursive behavior is either a default setting, implemented with a different naming convention, or controlled by a more general mechanism within the Pylint codebase that isn't directly tied to the exact string argument `--recursive=y`.\n\nThe result from searching for `--ignore` returning matches within `pylint/checkers/similar.py` is intriguing. This indicates that there's specific logic related to ignore functionality within a part of Pylint focused on checking for similarities, which might not be directly responsible for the file traversal and ignore logic in a broader sense. However, it's a starting point to understand how ignore patterns are implemented and could provide insight into how these patterns are being applied or perhaps missed during recursive directory traversal.\n\n### Next Steps for API Calls\nGiven the initial results and considering the necessary analysis, we should:\n\n1. Investigate how Pylint initializes its scanning process, especially how it decides which files or directories to include or exclude as this will give us insight into where the bug might lie in regards to not respecting ignore settings in recursive mode.\n\n2. Because the `--ignore-patterns` and `--ignore-paths` searches returned no results, it's possible these are handled differently than expected or are part of a larger configuration parsing mechanism. Understanding Pylint's configuration loading and parsing process could reveal how these arguments should be processed.\n\n3. The absence of direct hits for the recursive option hints that we should explore the codebase for file traversal or directory scanning logic, which may not necessarily explicitly reference the `--recursive` option.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the next API calls:\n\n- Search for general configuration loading or parsing logic which might involve all command-line arguments, including those for ignoring files.\n- Investigate how file or directory inclusion/exclusion is determined during the linting process to understand where the breakdown regarding ignored paths might occur.\n\nThus, the next API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_configuration\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`\n- `search_code(\"file_traversal\")`\n- `search_code(\"directory_scan\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify relevant parts of the code that are likely involved in processing the problematic behavior, even though the specific arguments returned no direct results."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Do we need more context:\n\nGiven the limited results from the initial search and the specific needs of the issue, it seems more context is indeed required to pin down the exact bug locations and to understand the mechanism Pylint uses for file parsing, especially in recursive mode and how it applies ignore rules.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations:\n\nSince the specific locations for the bug cannot be determined without further context from the codebase, particularly regarding how Pylint handles `--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths` in conjunction with `--recursive=y`, along with how it initializes and configures its linting process, I cannot provide an accurate or comprehensive identification of bug locations at this time.\n\n### Additional Context Needed:\n\nTo adequately pinpoint where the bug might be and understand the intended behavior at those locations, additional investigations into how Pylint performs its setup process, handles command-line arguments, and traverses directories for files to lint, especially with ignore filters applied, are necessary. Therefore, the following API calls are essential:\n\n1. `search_method(\"load_configuration\")`\n2. `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`\n3. `search_code(\"file_traversal\")`\n4. `search_code(\"directory_scan\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at uncovering parts of the code where the logic for handling recursive operations and applying ignore filters may reside. Without this information, proposing bug locations and their intended behaviors would be speculative and might not address the root cause of the issue described."
