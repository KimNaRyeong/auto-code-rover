        "intended_behavior": "This class should ensure that all command-line options, particularly those associated with ignoring files (`--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths`), are correctly parsed and affect the selection of files and directories for linting. Specifically, for the issue at hand, when `--recursive=y` is used, this class should properly interpret and pass the ignore options such that files and directories specified to be ignored are indeed excluded from linting. It may involve enhancing how command-line arguments are translated into configurations that affect the recursive file selection process."
