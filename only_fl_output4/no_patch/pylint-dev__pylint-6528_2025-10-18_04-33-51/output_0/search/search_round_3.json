This could mean that the recursive behavior is either a default setting, implemented with a different naming convention, or controlled by a more general mechanism within the Pylint codebase that isn't directly tied to the exact string argument `--recursive=y`.\n\nThe result from searching for `--ignore` returning matches within `pylint/checkers/similar.py` is intriguing. This indicates that there's specific logic related to ignore functionality within a part of Pylint focused on checking for similarities, which might not be directly responsible for the file traversal and ignore logic in a broader sense. However, it's a starting point to understand how ignore patterns are implemented and could provide insight into how these patterns are being applied or perhaps missed during recursive directory traversal.\n\n### Next Steps for API Calls\nGiven the initial results and considering the necessary analysis, we should:\n\n1. Investigate how Pylint initializes its scanning process, especially how it decides which files or directories to include or exclude as this will give us insight into where the bug might lie in regards to not respecting ignore settings in recursive mode.\n\n2. Because the `--ignore-patterns` and `--ignore-paths` searches returned no results, it's possible these are handled differently than expected or are part of a larger configuration parsing mechanism. Understanding Pylint's configuration loading and parsing process could reveal how these arguments should be processed.\n\n3. The absence of direct hits for the recursive option hints that we should explore the codebase for file traversal or directory scanning logic, which may not necessarily explicitly reference the `--recursive` option.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the next API calls:\n\n- Search for general configuration loading or parsing logic which might involve all command-line arguments, including those for ignoring files.\n- Investigate how file or directory inclusion/exclusion is determined during the linting process to understand where the breakdown regarding ignored paths might occur.\n\nThus, the next API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_configuration\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`\n- `search_code(\"file_traversal\")`\n- `search_code(\"directory_scan\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify relevant parts of the code that are likely involved in processing the problematic behavior, even though the specific arguments returned no direct results."

Further exploration into how `load_configuration` interfaces with command-line arguments is needed.\n- **For file selection/exclusion logic:** The failure to find matches for `file_traversal` and `directory_scan` implies that Pylint might employ a different terminology or structure for its file handling logic.

This includes handling various options passed to Pylint when it is invoked, likely including modes such as `--recursive`, and configurations like `--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths`.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug:\nSince the issue at hand involves Pylint not respecting certain ignore settings specifically when used in conjunction with the `--recursive=y` command-line option, the `_ArgumentsManager` class might be directly involved with or impact the bug. If this class is responsible for parsing and transferring these command-line options into a form that the rest of the Pylint application can act on, any flaws or oversights in how it processes or prioritizes these options could lead to the observed bug.\n\n#### Intended behavior:\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior of the code in `arguments_manager.py` would be to ensure that all command-line options related to ignoring files and directories are properly parsed, validated, and effectively communicated to the parts of the application responsible for file traversal and lint target selection. Specifically, it should:\n- Correctly parse `--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths` options, ensuring they are applied to the set of files and directories Pylint considers when running in `--recursive` mode.\n- Ensure that the default behavior of ignoring files and directories with names starting with a dot (`.`) is preserved and functioning as documented, even when explicit ignore options are not provided.\n\n### Next Steps for Gathering Context\n\nGiven the limitations of the current context to pinpoint the exact malfunction leading to the described bug, further investigation into how Pylint selects and filters its linting targets is necessary. Specifically, it may be beneficial to explore:\n\n1. How Pylint builds the list of files and directories to lint, especially in recursive mode, and how ignore options affect this process.\n2. Whether there are specific methods or classes responsible for applying these ignore rules to the file selection process that have not been identified yet.\n\nTherefore, it could be useful to attempt more targeted searches around the functionality mentioned in the `arguments_manager.py`, as well as broadening the search to identify where the list of files for linting is composed and how ignore rules are applied. However, given the constraints of our interaction, further searching is not possible, but these insights provide a good foundation for a more in-depth manual review or targeted queries in the codebase."

It may involve enhancing how command-line arguments are translated into configurations that affect the recursive file selection process.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, where ignored files are not respected in recursive mode, the problem likely resides not just in how arguments are parsed, but also in how those parsed configurations are utilized by the system to filter files/directories for linting.\n\n#### Additional Considerations:\nWithout direct access to the mechanism of file traversal and ignore rule application in recursive mode (no explicit `file_traversal` or `directory_scan` logic identified), one must assume that resolving the issue might involve either or both:\n\n- Ensuring the ignore rules are properly incorporated into the file/directory selection logic during the initial lint target setup phase, possibly requiring a review of how these configurations are passed along and used in the codebase.\n  \n- Verifying the integration between command-line parsing in `_ArgumentsManager` and the rest of the system, specifically how ignore configurations are handled.
