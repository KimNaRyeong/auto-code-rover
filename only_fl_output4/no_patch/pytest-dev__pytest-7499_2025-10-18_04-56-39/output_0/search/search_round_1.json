        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about the confusing message when using `pytest.raises` with a `match` that is not None, we need to examine the implementation of the `pytest.raises` function and any related mechanisms for matching error messages with the provided pattern. Since the issue mentions trouble with matching identical strings possibly due to the inclusion of parentheses, it's also relevant to understand how `pytest.raises` interprets and verifies the given `match` argument.\n\nBased on the issue description, we should start by investigating the core of pytest's exception handling mechanism, specifically the `raises` method, and how it processes the `match` argument. Additionally, because the issue highlights an `AssertionError` with a specific pattern not matching an identical string, examining the handling of the `match` argument inside `raises` for potential issues with string representations or regex interpretations would be critical.\n\nConsidering these points, the following API calls are necessary to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the `raises` method within pytest's codebase. This is crucial for understanding how pytest handles the `match` argument and performs the assertion.\n   \n2. Investigate any related utility functions or methods that `raises` might be using to compile, interpret, or compare the `match` argument against the raised exception message.\n\nGiven the information above, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`: This will help us find where the `raises` method is defined or used throughout the pytest codebase.\n  \n- `search_code(\"match=\")`: Since the issue focuses on the confusion around matching strings with parentheses, searching for how the `match` parameter is handled in code can provide insights into potential points where the logic could be improved. \n\nThese calls should provide a starting point for understanding the issue and identifying where modifications can be made to improve the error messaging when a match fails, especially in cases where the strings contain parentheses."

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the API calls we made:\n\n### 1. `search_method(\"raises\")`\n\nThe `raises` method has been found in two key files:\n\n- `testing/code/test_excinfo.py`: This file likely contains tests for the `raises` method, which is crucial for ensuring its functionality meets expectations. While this may not contain the implementation of `raises`, it's useful to understand the contexts in which `raises` is expected to function correctly.\n  \n- `src/_pytest/python_api.py`: This file is more promising with respect to the implementation of the `raises` method, given its location in the source directory. Since we have three matches here, it is highly likely that the actual logic and handling of the `raises` method, including how it interprets the `match` argument, are contained within this file.\n\nGiven the issue, the `raises` method in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` is of particular interest. It handles exception testing and uses the `match` argument to compare a pattern against the string representation of the exception message. The intended behavior should allow users to provide a regex pattern (or possibly a plain string) to match against the exception message. When such matching fails, especially in cases where the strings are visually identical but considered different due to hidden characters, parentheses handling, or regex interpretation issues, it leads to confusion, as described in the issue.\n\n### 2. `search_code(\"match=\")`\n\nThe code snippets containing `match=` are scattered across numerous testing-related files. Of particular interest are occurrences within `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and `testing/python/raises.py`, with the former likely pertaining to the implementation and the latter possibly to specific tests related to the `raises` functionality and its `match` argument handling.\n\n- The 3 matches within `src/_pytest/python_api.py` suggest this file deals directly with interpreting and applying the `match` argument in various scenarios. It is crucial for figuring out how the `raises` method processes its `match` argument.\n- The 17 matches in `testing/python/raises.py` imply a broad coverage of tests concerning the `match` functionality of the `raises` method. This can give us insight into the expected behavior and potentially the issue's root cause when the argument does not behave as intended.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo address the issue described, understanding exactly how the `raises` method in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` implements the `match` argument processing is key. Additionally, investigating the tests in `testing/python/raises.py` might reveal any existing test cases that aim to catch this specific behavior or lack thereof.\n\nGiven the provided information:\n\n1. **`raises` Implementation**: It would be beneficial to review the implementation details of `raises` in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` to see how the `match` argument is used, especially in terms of regex handling and string comparison.\n  \n2. **Tests and Expected Behaviors**: Examining how tests in `testing/python/raises.py` use `match=` can help us understand the intended functionality and potential gaps leading to the issue.\n\nTherefore, the next logical steps involve detailed reviews of the `raises` implementation in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` and the testing scenarios in `testing/python/raises.py` that specifically focus on the `match` argument. This will provide insights into the current behavior versus the expected or intended behavior that could address the confusion described in the issue."

This behavior should include:\n     - Explicitly checking if the provided `match` argument is a raw string or needs special handling to accurately interpret parentheses and other regex special characters.\n     - Enhancing the error message to provide more clarity on why a match failed, possibly suggesting checks for special characters or regex patterns.\n     - Maintaining existing functionality for straightforward string matches and regex pattern matches without introducing breaking changes.\n     - Optionally, integrating a check to warn or inform users when it looks like a regex pattern is intended but potentially misinterpreted due to issues like unescaped characters or lack of raw string notation.\n   \nThis refined approach in handling the `match` argument ensures that users have a clearer understanding of the functionality and limitations of the `match` parameter, particularly in complex scenarios involving special characters or detailed regex patterns."
