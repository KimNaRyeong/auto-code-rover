        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about the confusing message when using `pytest.raises` with a `match` that is not None, we need to examine the implementation of the `pytest.raises` function and any related mechanisms for matching error messages with the provided pattern. Since the issue mentions trouble with matching identical strings possibly due to the inclusion of parentheses, it's also relevant to understand how `pytest.raises` interprets and verifies the given `match` argument.\n\nBased on the issue description, we should start by investigating the core of pytest's exception handling mechanism, specifically the `raises` method, and how it processes the `match` argument. Additionally, because the issue highlights an `AssertionError` with a specific pattern not matching an identical string, examining the handling of the `match` argument inside `raises` for potential issues with string representations or regex interpretations would be critical.\n\nConsidering these points, the following API calls are necessary to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the `raises` method within pytest's codebase. This is crucial for understanding how pytest handles the `match` argument and performs the assertion.\n   \n2. Investigate any related utility functions or methods that `raises` might be using to compile, interpret, or compare the `match` argument against the raised exception message.\n\nGiven the information above, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`: This will help us find where the `raises` method is defined or used throughout the pytest codebase.\n  \n- `search_code(\"match=\")`: Since the issue focuses on the confusion around matching strings with parentheses, searching for how the `match` parameter is handled in code can provide insights into potential points where the logic could be improved. \n\nThese calls should provide a starting point for understanding the issue and identifying where modifications can be made to improve the error messaging when a match fails, especially in cases where the strings contain parentheses."
