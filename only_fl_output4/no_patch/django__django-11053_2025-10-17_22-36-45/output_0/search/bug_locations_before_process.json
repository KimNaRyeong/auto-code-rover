If a key is not uppercase, the method should either raise a ValueError indicating that only uppercase settings are allowed or silently skip setting these improperly named settings. This enforces the documented convention that settings should be uppercase. The existing functionality for setting custom settings via this method is preserved, except that it now validates the case of setting names."
