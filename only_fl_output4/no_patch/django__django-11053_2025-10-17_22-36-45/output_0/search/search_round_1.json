        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results:\n\n1. **`configure` method in `django/conf/__init__.py`:**\n   - **What it does**: The `configure` method allows setting up custom settings manually. It does so by creating a `UserSettingsHolder` instance, passing the `default_settings` to it, and then setting attributes based on the `**options` provided by the caller.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: This method does not currently enforce the uppercase-only rule for settings names, which allows any case-sensitive setting names to be used and subsequently passed on to the `UserSettingsHolder`. This behavior goes against the documentation that presumably states settings names must be uppercase.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior, based on the issue, would be to enforce that all setting names passed to `configure()` are uppercase. This would likely involve adding a check within the loop that iterates over `options.items()`, raising an error or ignoring settings that don't comply with the uppercase rule.\n\n2. **`UserSettingsHolder` class in `django/conf/__init__.py`:**\n   - **What it does**: This class acts as a container for user-defined settings. It provides mechanisms to set, get, and delete attributes (settings), plus some additional utility functions like determining if a setting is overridden.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The bug indicates that `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__()` allows retrieving non-upper settings, which is rooted in its implementation. However, the current implementation does not impose restrictions on the case of attribute names; it simply returns the value of the attribute if it exists or delegates to the `default_settings` otherwise.\n   - **Intended behavior**: While the `UserSettingsHolder` class is primarily concerned with the storage and retrieval of settings, imposing the uppercase naming convention appears to be outside its direct responsibility. That said, it could potentially enforce this convention on retrieval (though this doesn't prevent setting of non-uppercase settings) or provide a warning/error mechanism to discourage or prevent access to non-uppercase settings.\n\nGiven this understanding, the necessary adjustments to fix the bug involve:\n- Modifying the `configure` method to enforce uppercase names for the settings being set.\n- Optionally, considering if any enforcement or warnings should be added to `UserSettingsHolder` for accessing non-uppercase settings, though this might not directly resolve the issue but could serve as an additional layer of enforcing the convention.\n\nThe primary focus should be on adjusting the `configure` method to filter out or raise errors for non-uppercase setting names to align the behavior with the documented expectations."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

If a key is not uppercase, the method should either raise a ValueError indicating that only uppercase settings are allowed or silently skip setting these improperly named settings. This enforces the documented convention that settings should be uppercase. The existing functionality for setting custom settings via this method is preserved, except that it now validates the case of setting names.\n\n   Considering the specific use case and the documentation, raising an explicit error seems more aligned with the principle of failing fast, guiding users towards correct usage patterns.\n\nThe modification might look something like this:\n\n```python\nfor name, value in options.items():\n    if not name.isupper():\n        raise ValueError(f\"Setting names must be uppercase. Found: '{name}'\")\n    setattr(holder, name, value)\n```\n\nThis change makes sure that any attempt to configure settings with non-uppercase names is immediately flagged, aligning the code\u2019s behavior with the documentation and preventing subtle errors that could arise from ignoring the convention."
