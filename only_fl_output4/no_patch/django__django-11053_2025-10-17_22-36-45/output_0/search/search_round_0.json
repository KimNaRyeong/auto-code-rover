        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to gather more context about how `settings.configure()` and `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__()` are implemented and interact with non-upper case settings. This requires looking into the Django codebase, specifically in the `django.conf` module where settings management is likely to occur. We'll start with:\n\n1. Locating the implementation of `settings.configure()` to understand how it processes settings.\n2. Finding where `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__()` is defined to see how it retrieves setting values.\n\nFirst, let's find where `settings.configure()` is implemented and then search for the `UserSettingsHolder` class along with its `__getattr__` method:\n\n- search_method(\"configure\")\n- search_class(\"UserSettingsHolder\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"UserSettingsHolder\")"
