Wrong relative path in skip report when tested file is upper than invocation directory
The problem is if tested file is upper than invocation directory . It occurs in skip report.
Example: 
path of tested file is:`/home/xyz/my_tests/test1.py`
and `pytest` is called in location: `/home/xyz/pytest`.

```bash
 xyz@ubuntu:~/pytest$ pytest -rs ../my_tests/test1.py
============================================== test session starts ===============================================

============================================ short test summary info =============================================
SKIPPED [1] my_tests/test1.py:3: no way of currently testing this

```
Instead ``SKIPPED [1] my_tests/test1.py:3: no way of currently testing this`` it should be
``SKIPPED [1] ../my_tests/test1.py:3: no way of currently testing this``.
