To address the issue specified, I will provide you with a Python script (`reproducer.py`) designed to mimic the conditions under which the problem emerges. This script will programmatically create the necessary directory structure, a dummy test file to be skipped, and finally will invoke `pytest` leveraging Python's `subprocess` module to capture and analyze pytest's output. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` displaying a stack trace pinpointing the exact failure point.

Here is how the `reproducer.py` script can be structured:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_file(test_directory: str, test_file_name: str):
    if not os.path.exists(test_directory):
        os.makedirs(test_directory)
    test_file_path = os.path.join(test_directory, test_file_name)
    with open(test_file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write("""
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="no way of currently testing this")
def test_sample():
    pass
""")
    return test_file_path

def run_pytest_on_file(test_file_path: str):
    invocation_directory = "pytest_invocation_dir"
    if not os.path.exists(invocation_directory):
        os.makedirs(invocation_directory)
    command = ["pytest", "-rs", test_file_path]
    result = subprocess.run(command, cwd=invocation_directory, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    return result

def verify_skip_message(result, test_file_path):
    expected_message = f"SKIPPED [1] {test_file_path}:3: no way of currently testing this"
    if expected_message not in result.stderr:
        raise AssertionError(f"Expected message not found in pytest output: {expected_message}")

def main():
    try:
        test_directory = "../my_tests"
        test_file_name = "test1.py"
        test_file_path = create_test_file(test_directory, test_file_name)
        result = run_pytest_on_file(test_file_path)
        verify_skip_message(result, test_file_path)
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script follows these steps:
1. It creates a test file with a `pytest` skip mark.
2. It runs `pytest` on this file from a different (nested) directory.
3. It checks `pytest`'s output to verify whether the skip message contains the correct relative path to the skipped test.
4. If the message does not contain the correct information (demonstrating the reported issue), it raises an `AssertionError` and outputs a stack trace for debugging purposes.

Remember, `pytest` needs to be installed in your Python environment for this script to work, and you may need to adjust the paths or environment according to your specific setup or operating system.
