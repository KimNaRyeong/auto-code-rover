        "content": "To resolve the issue about the wrong relative path in the skip report when the tested file is located in a directory above the invocation directory, we should gather information about how the path is generated and used in the skip report. For this, we need to look into the parts of the code that deal with the test collection, skip report generation, and possibly path normalization or resolution. Given the tools at our disposal, let's start with the following API calls:\n\n1. search_method(\"report_skipped_tests\"): This method likely handles the reporting of skipped tests, including the message formation that contains the path.\n\n2. search_code(\"SKIPPED\"): This code snippet could be part of forming the message for skipped tests and might help locate where the relative path is appended to the skip report.\n\n3. search_code(\"rootdir\"): Since the output mentions \"rootdir\" as part of the test session start, looking for how \"rootdir\" is defined and used might give insights into how paths are resolved or normalized relative to it.\n\nThese calls should give us a good starting point for understanding how paths are handled in skipped test reports."
