This script `reproducer.py` will reproduce the issue as described and should meet the requirements you mentioned. It attempts to convert a multi-indexed `DataArray` to a pandas series and expects to trigger a `NotImplementedError` due to the attempt to check for NA values in a `MultiIndex` scenario which isn't supported within the provided context.

The script will:
- Raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, providing a detailed stack trace.
- Print "Issue appears to be fixed." and exit with code 0 if the attempted operation completes successfully, indicating the issue has been resolved.
