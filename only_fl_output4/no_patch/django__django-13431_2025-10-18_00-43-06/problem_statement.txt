QuerySet.aggregate() mixes annotated fields names.
Description
	
I have the following model (simplified for opening the issue).
class T(models.Model):
 id = models.AutoField(primary=True)
 foo = models.IntegerField()
and I perform the following query on MySQL (simplified for opening the issue)
T.objects.annotate(anon=F('foo')).aggregate(foo=Max(F('anon')), sum=Sum(F('foo')))
this produces the following SQL query
SELECT MAX(`anon`), SUM(`foo`) FROM (SELECT `table`.`foo` AS `anon` FROM `foo`) subquery
that causes the following exception
django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1054, "Unknown column 'foo' in 'field list'")
I would expect django to generate
SELECT MAX(`anon`), SUM(`anon`) FROM (SELECT `table`.`foo` AS `anon` FROM `table`) subquery
