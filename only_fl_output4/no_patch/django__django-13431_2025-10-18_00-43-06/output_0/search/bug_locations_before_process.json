To resolve the issue, the method's behavior needs to ensure that: 1. When an annotated field is included in an aggregate function, the generated SQL should accurately reference the annotated field as it is represented within the internal SQL subquery structure. 2. It properly handles the aliasing of fields to ensure that any field, once annotated, can be referenced by its alias in aggregate functions without causing SQL errors. 3. The logic that verifies and constructs the aggregation part of the SQL query needs to correctly interpret annotated fields and utilize their alias names as intended, preventing the generation of invalid SQL statements."

        "intended_behavior": "Although the primary issue seems to stem from the aggregate method, it's crucial that the annotate method correctly sets up annotations for subsequent operations like aggregation. Thus, ensuring that: 1. Annotations created by this method are seamlessly integrated into the queryset in such a way that they can be accurately referred to in subsequent aggregation operations. 2. The method provides clear, reliable handling for the assignment of aliases to annotated fields and ensures these aliases are directly usable in subsequent aggregate calls without ambiguity or error."
