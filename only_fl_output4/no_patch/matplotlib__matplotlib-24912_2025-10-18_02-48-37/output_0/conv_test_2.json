While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\r\nprint( myplot.levels )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\r\n\r\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif not self.filled:\r\n            inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\r\n            levels_in = self.levels[inside]\r\n            if len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\r\n                self.levels = [self.zmin]\r\n                _api.warn_external(\r\n                    \"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\r\n```\n"

        "content": "Given the clarification needed to create a script that raises an `AssertionError` as specified when the issue is present, and reflects the behavior described in the reported Matplotlib issue, let's reformulate the `reproducer.py` script. The goal here is to ensure that the assertion fails if the `levels` attribute is changed unexpectedly by Matplotlib, reproducing the described issue where user-specified contour levels outside the data range are inappropriately altered by the library.\n\nLet's implement the adjustments considering the provided function to print a stack trace more accurately.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_plot_with_levels_outside_range():\n    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)\n    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n    data = np.sin(X) * np.cos(Y) * 10  # Multiply by 10 to ensure data range falls below the level 100\n\n    try:\n        # Note: the reported behavior differs from Matplotlib's documentation and expectations.\n        # To reproduce the specific issue, we check if Matplotlib inappropriately modifies the specified levels.\n        myplot = plt.contour(X, Y, data, levels=[100])\n        levels = myplot.levels\n        assert np.array_equal(levels, [100]), f\"Incorrect contour levels: Expected [100], got {levels}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        test_plot_with_levels_outside_range()\n    except AssertionError:\n        exit(1)\n    else:\n        exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script specifically addresses the reported issue by ensuring `data` produces a range that does not include the specific contour level of `100`, thus correctly setting up the test scenario as per the issue description. The script checks if the result of the `levels` attribute strictly equals `[100]`, as it should be when Matplotlib respects the explicitly given contour levels, despite them being outside the actual data range.\n\nIf Matplotlib's behavior has changed or if there was a mistake in expecting an error or change in behavior when executing the test, the script's behavior might differ (e.g., exiting with code `0` if the issue is fixed or not present). However, based on the issue's description, this script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the problem occurs, printing a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes."
