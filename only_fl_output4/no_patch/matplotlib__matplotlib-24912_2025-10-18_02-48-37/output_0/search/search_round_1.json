        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

Let's dive into each part of the code and answer the questions raised:\n\n### Analysis of `_process_contour_level_args` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `_process_contour_level_args` method is responsible for determining the contour levels and storing them in `self.levels`. It processes either the user-defined levels passed as arguments or defaults based on the data type (boolean or numeric) and contour type (filled or unfilled). Notably, if no levels are within the data range for unfilled contours, it sets `self.levels` to contain only the minimum data value, following an external warning.\n\n#### Relationship between this Part of the Code and the Bug\nThe issue arises specifically in the segment where it checks if the contour levels fall within the data range (`zmin` to `zmax`). If none do, and for unfilled contours, it defaults to `[self.zmin]`, overriding the user-defined levels. This behavior can lead to confusion or erroneous results in batch processing scenarios where specific contour levels are desired, regardless of the data range.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended modification, as derived from the issue description, is to permit users to override this autoscaling behavior via a keyword argument, likely introduced in the call to `plt.contour()` and propagated here. When the override flag is true, the conditional autoscaling logic should be bypassed, maintaining the user-defined contour levels even if they fall outside the data range.\n\n### Actionable Insights\nGiven the examination, the required changes involve introducing a new keyword argument that influences the behavior of the `_process_contour_level_args` method. Specifically, this flag should adjust the conditional logic around lines 1141-1147 to skip automatic scaling of `self.levels` based on the data range when the user desires to use custom contour levels, potentially outside the existing data bounds.\n\n### Next Steps\nImplementing the change will require:\n- Adding a new keyword argument at the point of defining or calling contours that allows users to specify their preference for overriding the autoscale feature.\n- Modifying the `ContourSet` class to accommodate this new argument, which influences the logic flow in `_process_contour_level_args` to optionally skip the autoscaling to `[self.zmin]`.\n- Ensuring that this change does not adversely impact existing behavior, especially in default or unspecified cases, to maintain backward compatibility.\n\nThis analysis lays the groundwork for precisely targeting the code modification needed to address the reported issue while preserving the existing functionalities of Matplotlib contours."

This keyword argument (`override_autoscale`) should be checked within the conditional statement that currently sets `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]` if all requested levels are outside the data range. If `override_autoscale` is true, this adjustment should be bypassed, thereby preserving the user-specified levels regardless of whether they fall within the data range. This implementation should ensure:\n   \n   - Existing functionality remains unchanged by default (i.e., without specifying the new argument), maintaining backward compatibility.\n   - When the override is active, user-defined contour levels are retained as specified, even if they do not align with the data range.\n\nThe addition of this new keyword argument would likely also necessitate updates elsewhere in the code where `ContourSet` or the `contour/contourf` functions are invoked or defined, ensuring the new argument is properly passed through. However, based on the current context, the primary modification to fix the bug is located in the mentioned method."
