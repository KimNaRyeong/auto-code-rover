However, since the data is not processed directly by `AdaBoost*` but by its base estimator (on which `fit`, `predict_proba` and `predict` may be called), we should not need to constrain the data that much, allowing for `X` to be a list of text blobs or similar.\nSimilar may apply to other ensemble methods.\nDerived from #7767.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to understand how the AdaBoost and possibly other ensemble methods validate their input `X`. We aim to see if we can relax the type and format constraints on `X` to allow not just arrays or sparse matrices but potentially more varied data types like lists of text blobs. Given this, the following API calls are strategic to gather needed context:\n\n1. **Search for the AdaBoost class**: We want to find which file(s) the AdaBoost classifier or regressor is defined in since the issue seems to focus on AdaBoost specifically.\n   - `search_class(\"AdaBoost\")`\n\n2. **Search for validation methods within the AdaBoost class**: Since the issue mentions that the validation of `X` might be unnecessarily strict, we want to find the segments where AdaBoost is performing this validation. It's likely done in methods like `fit`, `predict_proba`, and `predict` according to the issue details.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"AdaBoost\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"predict_proba\", \"AdaBoost\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"predict\", \"AdaBoost\")`\n\n3. **Search for other ensemble method classes**: The issue suggests that similar validation constraints may apply to other ensemble methods. Identifying these classes can help evaluate if a broader approach is needed.\n   - `search_class(\"Ensemble\")`\n\n4. **Search for code snippets that perform validation**: We're looking for any specific validation checks on `X` to see how they are implemented and whether they are tightly coupled with the assumption that `X` must be an array or sparse matrix. Although we don't have a specific method name for validation, such checks might be mentioned in method docs or inline comments.\n   - `search_code(\"validate_X\")`\n\nEach selected call aims to map out the relevant parts of the code dealing with data validation in AdaBoost and potentially other ensemble methods to understand the current implementation and constraints better. This information will serve as a foundation for proposing a patch to relax data type constraints on `X`."
