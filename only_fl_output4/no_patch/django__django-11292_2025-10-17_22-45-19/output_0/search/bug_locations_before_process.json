        "intended_behavior": "The `add_arguments` method should be enhanced to include an argument definition for `--skip-checks`. This modification would enable the parser to recognize the `--skip-checks` command line argument when provided by the user. The implementation should ensure that when `--skip-checks` is specified, it sets an option (e.g., `options['skip_checks'] = True`) that can be checked in the command execution flow to conditionally skip the execution of checks. This addition preserves existing functionality while providing the new capability to skip checks."
