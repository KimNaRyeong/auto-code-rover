        "content": "To gather the sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, we should focus on the `model_to_dict` function and understand how it interacts with the `fields` argument. Since the issue specifically mentions a problem in the behavior of `model_to_dict` and how it treats the `fields` parameter, we'll need to find this function and review its implementation. The problem statement also hints at a faulty if condition that should be corrected.\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls will be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the `model_to_dict` method:** To find where `model_to_dict` is implemented, which will give us the file name and the location within that file.\n\n2. **Search for the problematic code snippet:** The provided problem statement mentions `if fields and f.name not in fields:` which seems to be the problematic line. Searching for this snippet will confirm its exact location and the surrounding code context.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_method(\"model_to_dict\")`\n- `search_code(\"if fields and f.name not in fields:\")`"
