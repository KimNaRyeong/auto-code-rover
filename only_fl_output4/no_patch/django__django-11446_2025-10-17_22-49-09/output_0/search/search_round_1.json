        "content": "To resolve the issue of default error webpages not being correctly-formed HTML pages in Django 2.2.1 when `DEBUG=False`, we need insights into how Django handles error responses, specifically for 404 (Not Found) errors in a non-debug mode. The default error handling mechanism and templates Django uses for rendering these pages are crucial here. Given the description, our focus might be on how Django constructs the error page for 404 errors when `DEBUG=False`.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for potential classes or modules related to error handling in Django:\n   - `search_class(\"Http404\")`\n   - This call is based on the assumption that `Http404` is a commonly used exception for 404 errors in Django projects.\n\n2. Search for the method that might be responsible for rendering the 404 error pages, likely found in Django's views or error handling utility modules:\n   - `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`\n   - `search_method(\"default_error_view\")`\n   - These methods are assumed to be involved in handling or rendering 404 error pages based on standard naming conventions in Django or web frameworks in general.\n\n3. Since the issue specifies the difference in error page rendering based on the `DEBUG` setting, it would be useful to investigate the code paths that check the `DEBUG` setting while handling error responses:\n   - `search_code(\"settings.DEBUG\")`\n   - This code snippet is critical for understanding how the `DEBUG` mode influences error page rendering.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the Django codebase that are responsible for error handling, particularly for 404 errors, and how the `DEBUG` setting influences the rendering of error pages. The insights gathered from these API calls will help us identify where modifications can be made to ensure that a correctly-formed HTML page is served in all scenarios."

The `Http404` class is a subclass of `Exception`, used specifically for handling 404 Not Found errors in Django.\n\n   **Analysis**:  \n   - This part of the code defines the exception to be raised when a requested resource is not found.  \n   - It's related to the bug because any handling or rendering of a 404 error page likely starts with this exception being raised.  \n   - The intended behavior related to the issue would not be directly in the exception itself but in how this exception is caught and handled to render the 404 error page.\n\n2. **Result from `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`**:  \n   Found a method `page_not_found` in `django/views/defaults.py`. This method serves as the default 404 handler, attempting to render a template named `404.html` or falling back to a simple string containing HTML content if that template doesn't exist.\n\n   **Analysis**:  \n   - This part of the code is responsible for rendering the 404 page when the requested resource cannot be found. It tries to load a custom template for the 404 page and, failing that, defaults to rendering a basic HTML response.\n   - It is directly related to the bug. The fallback HTML response (`<h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>`) does not include a full HTML document structure (`<html>`, `<body>` tags, etc.), which is the core complaint in the issue.\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior here would be to ensure that even the fallback response is a correctly-formed HTML document. This means wrapping the existing content in `<html>` and `<body>` tags, at a minimum.\n\n3. **Result from `search_method(\"default_error_view\")`**:  \n   Could not find the method `default_error_view` in the codebase.\n\n   **Analysis**:  \n   - This indicates there might not be a generic default error view by this name, or the concept is handled differently in Django. With no direct result, the focus remains on the `page_not_found` function and possibly how Django's settings influence behavior, notably with the `DEBUG` setting.\n\n4. **Result from `search_code(\"settings.DEBUG\")`**:  \n   The code snippet `settings.DEBUG` was found in multiple files, indicating its widespread use in determining behavior based on whether the site is running in debug mode.\n\n   **Analysis**:  \n   - `settings.DEBUG` influences various aspects of how Django operates, likely including error handling and the rendering of error pages.\n   - While the specific code snippets were not detailed, the prevalence of this setting suggests it could play a role in how error pages are generated and displayed. For instance, in debug mode, Django provides detailed error reports, which would not be the case when `DEBUG=False`.\n   - Related to the issue, the behavior when `DEBUG=False` might not correctly prioritize returning fully structured HTML error pages, especially for 404 errors without a custom template.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe direct path to a solution involves modifying the `page_not_found` default handler to ensure its fallback content is encapsulated within a complete HTML document structure. This involves addressing the part of the code that generates the fallback error message. Given the widespread references to `settings.DEBUG`, a nuanced consideration could be ensuring that any changes made gracefully degrade or enhance the user experience appropriately based on the debugging status. However, the immediate bug fix seems to be localized to improving the default 404 error handling logic."

Location 1: File: django/views/defaults.py, Function: page_not_found.\n   - Intended Behavior: The function responsible for handling 404 errors should ensure that if it fails to find a custom 404 template and resorts to rendering default content, this content is a well-formed HTML document. Currently, the fallback error page is just a snippet of HTML (`<h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>`) that lacks the necessary HTML (`<html>`, `<body>`) tags to make a complete document. To resolve the issue, we should modify the fallback content by wrapping it within `<html>` and `<body>` tags. Additionally, the `Content-Type` header should be set to `text/html` to ensure proper rendering by browsers. The improved fallback would thus look like:\n\n```python\ntemplate = Engine().from_string('''\n<html>\n<body>\n  <h1>Not Found</h1>\n  <p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>\n</body>\n</html>''')\n```\n\nThis change ensures the response meets basic HTML document standards, improving the user experience by providing a correctly formed HTML page even in cases where a custom template is not used or found. This is especially relevant when `DEBUG=False`, aligning the behavior more closely with what users and developers would expect from a production environment."
