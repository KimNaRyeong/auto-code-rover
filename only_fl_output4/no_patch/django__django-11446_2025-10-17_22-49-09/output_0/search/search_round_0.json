        "content": "To resolve the issue of default error webpages not being correctly-formed HTML pages in Django 2.2.1 when `DEBUG=False`, we need insights into how Django handles error responses, specifically for 404 (Not Found) errors in a non-debug mode. The default error handling mechanism and templates Django uses for rendering these pages are crucial here. Given the description, our focus might be on how Django constructs the error page for 404 errors when `DEBUG=False`.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for potential classes or modules related to error handling in Django:\n   - `search_class(\"Http404\")`\n   - This call is based on the assumption that `Http404` is a commonly used exception for 404 errors in Django projects.\n\n2. Search for the method that might be responsible for rendering the 404 error pages, likely found in Django's views or error handling utility modules:\n   - `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`\n   - `search_method(\"default_error_view\")`\n   - These methods are assumed to be involved in handling or rendering 404 error pages based on standard naming conventions in Django or web frameworks in general.\n\n3. Since the issue specifies the difference in error page rendering based on the `DEBUG` setting, it would be useful to investigate the code paths that check the `DEBUG` setting while handling error responses:\n   - `search_code(\"settings.DEBUG\")`\n   - This code snippet is critical for understanding how the `DEBUG` mode influences error page rendering.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the Django codebase that are responsible for error handling, particularly for 404 errors, and how the `DEBUG` setting influences the rendering of error pages. The insights gathered from these API calls will help us identify where modifications can be made to ensure that a correctly-formed HTML page is served in all scenarios."
