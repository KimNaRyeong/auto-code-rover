        "intended_behavior": "The issue appears to arise because the method cannot correctly handle the extraction when faced with expressions that are assembled using Mul with evaluate=False, particularly when trying to extract a factor from a product that is negated or involves negation. The intended behavior is for extract_multiplicatively to: - Properly recognize and facilitate the extraction of multiplicatively inverse elements especially in cases where the expression and the factor share a negation, such as attempting to extract -2 from (-2*x - 4*y - 8). - Preserve existing functionality for all other use cases, ensuring no regression or unintended side effects on the current capabilities of the method. This involves possibly addressing how non-evaluated Mul expressions are treated by the method, ensuring that factors can be extracted whether or not the expression has been evaluated. - Consider enhancing the method to handle cases where the common factor is spread across terms in the expression, possibly by improving the logic that interacts with primitive or the handling of evaluated vs. non-evaluated expressions."
