Certainly! Below is the corrected version of a Python script designed to reproduce the described issue. The script will attempt to demonstrate the problem with `pd.NA` causing an axis reversal in a plot. If the issue is present an `AssertionError` will be thrown, and the stack trace will be printed as requested. The script will exit with code 0 if and when the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_issue():
    # Create mock data
    mock_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'date': ['0', '1', '2', '3'],
        'value': [1, 2, 1, 1.5]
    })

    mock_data_full = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_full['type'] = 'no_NA'

    mock_data_pd_na = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_pd_na['type'] = 'pd.NA'
    mock_data_pd_na.loc[2, 'value'] = pd.NA

    mock_data_np_nan = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_np_nan['type'] = 'np.nan'
    mock_data_np_nan.loc[2, 'value'] = np.nan

    test_data = pd.concat([mock_data_full, mock_data_pd_na, mock_data_np_nan])

    grid = sns.FacetGrid(
        data=test_data,
        col='type',
        sharey=False,
        sharex=True
    )
    
    grid.map(sns.lineplot, 'date', 'value', alpha=0.5)
    plt.close()  # Prevent the actual plot from showing during the test
   
    # Check if the issue is present by comparing y-limits for no_NA and pd.NA plots
    # For simplicity, use the recorded data positions in the subplot grid
    axes = grid.axes.flatten()
    y_limits_no_na = axes[0].get_ylim()
    y_limits_pd_na = axes[1].get_ylim()

    # The issue is present if y-limits are inverted (i.e., start is greater than end)
    if y_limits_no_na[0] > y_limits_no_na[1] or y_limits_pd_na[0] > y_limits_pd_na[1]:
        raise ValueError("Detected axis inversion.")

def main():
    try:
        check_for_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code indicating failure to pass the test
    else:
        print("Issue not present, axis order is as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code indicating the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script ensures that if `pd.NA` is leading to axis inversion in seaborn plots, the issue is caught and described in detail. However, it will only raise an error and display a stack trace if the underlying conditions for the issue are met â€“ if pandas or seaborn internals have changed in a way that resolves this issue, or the issue cannot be reproduced under the current conditions, the script will exit successfully.
