It appears there was a misunderstanding or possibly an environment setup issue in the previous interaction. The error message you received indicates that the `pandas` module (or possibly other required modules like `seaborn` and `matplotlib`) wasn't installed in your Python environment, which is necessary for the script to run.

To address the previous instructions and ensure that the environment is properly set up for the Python script, make sure to have all the necessary packages installed. This includes `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. If you're using a `conda` environment, ensure you activate the correct environment where these packages are installed. If the packages are not yet installed, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

Or, if using `conda`, you can install these packages using:

```bash
conda install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

Assuming the necessary packages are installed, below is a corrected or reiterated version of the standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) designed to reproduce the issue based on your request for a script that raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present. 

Please note: This script is based on the premise that the issue you're encountering is related to plotting behavior with `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. If the environment issue persists (i.e., missing modules), it needs to be resolved first by ensuring all necessary libraries are installed in your active Python environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import seaborn as sns

    mock_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'date': ['0', '1', '2', '3'],
        'value': [1, 2, 1, 1.5]
    })

    mock_data_full = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_full['type'] = 'no_NA'

    mock_data_pd_na = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_pd_na['type'] = 'pd.NA'
    mock_data_pd_na.loc[2, 'value'] = pd.NA

    mock_data_np_nan = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_np_nan['type'] = 'np.nan'
    mock_data_np_nan.loc[2, 'value'] = np.nan

    test_data = pd.concat([mock_data_full, mock_data_pd_na, mock_data_np_nan])

    sns.set(style="darkgrid")
    
    try:
        grid = sns.FacetGrid(
            data=test_data,
            col='type',
            sharey=True,  # Assuming we are looking to ensure y-axis consistency across facets
            sharex=True
        )
        
        grid.map(sns.lineplot, 'date', 'value')

        # Since the issue described relates to plotting, it's challenging
        # to programmatically assert correctness without visual inspection.
        # Instead, you might save the plot and manually inspect, or ensure
        # settings are consistent. Let's check data ordering for an approximation:
        
        check_order = test_data.groupby('type')['value'].apply(lambda x: all(x.diff().dropna() >= 0)).all()
        assert check_order, "Data ordering affected by presence of NAs"
        
    except Exception as e:  # Catching all exceptions for illustrative purposes
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure this script is run in an environment where all the required libraries are present. This script aims to check if the presence of NAs (`pd.NA` or `np.nan`) affects the order of the data (and hene, potentially, the plot) but does not directly assess the visual order of axis elements in a plot, given that such an assessment typically requires manual inspection.
