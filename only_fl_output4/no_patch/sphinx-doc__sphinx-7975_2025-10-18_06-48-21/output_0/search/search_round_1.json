To understand how index entries are processed and categorized into different sections, including \"Symbols\", we need to identify the classes and methods responsible for generating the index for the HTML output. We can start by searching for a method that might be directly responsible for this functionality, such as something related to index processing or HTML generation. \n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"generateIndex\")\nsearch_method(\"createIndex\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that symbols like \"@\", \"\u00a3\", and \"\u2190\" are categorized into separate \"Symbols\" sections with the same HTML anchor, it's important to understand how symbols are classified and how anchors are generated. This could be handled in a method related to sorting or categorizing entries, or directly within the index generation logic.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"categorizeIndexEntries\")\nsearch_method(\"sortIndexEntries\")\n```\n\n3. The issue description suggests a problem with how entries starting with certain symbols are handled differently, leading to two \"Symbols\" sections instead of one. There might be specific code handling these symbols.

However, under the constraints of the current situation, I can still hypothesize on common patterns where such an issue might occur and propose a generic approach for resolving the reported issue:\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Location and Intended Behavior\n\n#### Bug Location:\n- **File:** (The specific file where index entries are processed for HTML output. Since the search did not return specifics, this is a placeholder.)\n- **Class:** (A class likely responsible for generating the index or organizing the HTML output. This could be something similar to `HtmlGenerator` or `IndexProcessor`, but the exact name is unknown.)\n- **Method:** (A method within the above class that deals with sorting or categorizing the index entries before they are turned into HTML output. The exact method is unknown, as specific search terms like `generateHtml`, `processEntries`, or similar did not yield results.)\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- The method responsible for organizing index entries into the \"Symbols\" section needs to be modified or extended to ensure that all special characters are treated uniformly. Instead of allowing entries starting with certain symbols to be categorized into separate \"Symbols\" sections, the process should:\n  - Recognize all special characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, _\u2190_, and any others defined as symbols) uniformly and group them under a single \"Symbols\" section.\n  - Ensure that the HTML anchor used for the \"Symbols\" section is unique and consistent, such that there is only one \"Symbols\" section, and all special character entries are included within it.\n  - Preserve existing functionality for sorting and categorizing alphabetical and numeric entries, ensuring that the introduction of a unified \"Symbols\" section does not adversely affect the existing index structure.\n  - Update or refine any logic or heuristics used to determine the categorization of entries, ensuring robust handling of symbols, possibly through an updated sorting algorithm or an expanded categorization schema to encompass the full range of possible characters encountered in index entries.\n\nGiven the lack of specific search results, further investigation into the codebase is necessary to identify the exact locations and methods that require modification. The above hypothetical approach suggests a direction for resolving the issue based on common principles of content organization in software documentation or similar HTML outputs."
