Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

Search for the implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag within Django's template system.\n2. Explore how the template system handles escaping, particularly with `SafeString` instances, to understand the current mechanism for preventing double escaping.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_code(\"blocktranslate asvar\")`: This will help find the code responsible for processing the `blocktranslate` tag when the `asvar` argument is used.\n2. `search_class(\"SafeString\")`: We need to understand the `SafeString` class to see how it's used to prevent escaping of variables marked as safe.\n3. `search_method(\"escape\")`: To see how and where Django escapes variables for output in templates, which could be relevant to understanding double escaping issue.\n4. `search_code(\"escape\")`: Since escaping could be handled in various places outside of a method named `escape`, let's also find references to escaping behavior throughout the codebase."
