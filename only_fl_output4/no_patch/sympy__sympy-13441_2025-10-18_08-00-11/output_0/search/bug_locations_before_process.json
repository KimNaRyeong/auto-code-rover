This could involve introducing optimizations like caching intermediate results or employing a more efficient algorithm for traversing and counting operations in an expression. The method should maintain accuracy in counting operations while minimizing the computational overhead for large symbolic expressions."

Possible improvements include optimizing the use of diff and _eval_derivative methods to reduce redundant computations, especially in the context of large systems where the Jacobian computation currently becomes a bottleneck. The optimization should ensure that the calculated Jacobian remains accurate but is computed in a way that significantly reduces the computational load and execution time, particularly for expressions involving a large number of derivatives."

This could involve better handling of expressions to minimize computation before applying differentiation, simplifying expressions where possible before the differentiation process, or employing more efficient algorithms for symbolic differentiation. The goal is to preserve the method's current functionality, ensuring accurate differentiation, while improving performance for complex or large expressions."
