Below is an updated version of `reproducer.py` tailored to your specifications. This revised script attempts to replicate the specified issue involving `PairGrid` errors with `hue` assigned in `map`. Should the problem be current, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace of the issue. On the other hand, if the issue is resolved, the script will exit with code 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

        # it's adjusted to pass the column name directly
