They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to making mixture models more compatible with the clusterer interface, we should perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the mixture model classes to understand their current implementation.\n2. Find how the `n_components` parameter is used within these classes.\n3. Check for the existence or implementation detail of the `labels_` attribute in these models.\n4. Look for a `fit_predict` method in both mixture models and clusterer classes to compare their presence or implementation details.\n5. Investigate how mixture models are documented compared to clusterers, which likely involves searching through documentation files rather than code.\n\nHowever, the last point cannot be directly addressed with the given API capabilities, focusing on the first four points with API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"MixtureModel\")`: To see if there's a base or common class for mixture models from which specifics inherit.\n- `search_code(\"n_components\")`: To find how and where `n_components` is defined and used across mixture models.\n- `search_code(\"labels_\")`: To check if and how `labels_` might be used or why it's missing.\n- `search_method(\"fit_predict\")`: To check the existence and implementation details of `fit_predict` across the codebase. This is important to assess whether it's feasible or beneficial to add this method to mixture models to align with clusterers."
