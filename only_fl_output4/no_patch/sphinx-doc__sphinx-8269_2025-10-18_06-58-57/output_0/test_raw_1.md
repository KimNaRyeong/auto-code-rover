Given the error message indicating that `sphinx-quickstart` could not be found, it's possible that Sphinx isn't installed in your environment, or the environment path doesn't include the location of Sphinx's scripts. Before running the revised script, ensure Sphinx is installed and accessible in your environment. If Sphinx is installed but the script still fails to find `sphinx-quickstart`, you might need to activate the environment where Sphinx is installed or adjust your `PATH`.

Here's the revised `reproducer.py` that attempts to address the initial problem statement. This script assumes Sphinx is installed and `sphinx-quickstart` is accessible:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    try:
        # Assuming Sphinx is installed and sphinx-quickstart is in PATH
        subprocess.run(["sphinx-quickstart", "--project", "proj", "--sep", "--author", "me",
                         "--release", "1.0", "--language", "en", "--quiet", "--no-makefile", "--no-batchfile"], check=True)
        # Append a link that leads to a 404 page with an anchor to index.rst
        with open("source/index.rst", "a") as f:
            f.write("\n`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def run_linkcheck():
    try:
        # Execute 'sphinx-build -b linkcheck' instead of 'make linkcheck' for compatibility
        result = subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "linkcheck", "source", "build/linkcheck"], 
                                capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return result.stdout + result.stderr
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_issue_present(output):
    expected_msg = "broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt"
    actual_msg = "broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - Anchor 'test' not found"
    if actual_msg in output and expected_msg not in output:
        raise AssertionError("Issue is present: linkcheck reports anchor not found instead of HTTP error.")

try:
    setup_sphinx_project()
    output = run_linkcheck()
    check_issue_present(output)
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("Issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script:
1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project using `sphinx-quickstart`.
2. Adds a document with a broken link containing an anchor to `index.rst`.
3. Runs the `sphinx-build` command with the `linkcheck` builder instead of using `make`, which is more universally compatible, especially on environments where `make` isn't configured.
4. Checks the output for the presence of the issue and raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected.

**Important Note**: Before running this script, ensure that Sphinx is correctly installed in your current Python environment. You can install Sphinx using `pip install sphinx`. If the command `sphinx-quickstart` still isn't recognized, ensure that the `Scripts` or `bin` directory of your Python environment is in your system's `PATH`.
