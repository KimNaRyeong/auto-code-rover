        "intended_behavior": "This method should first check the HTTP status of the URI without considering the anchor. If the HTTP status code represents an error (e.g., 404, 500), that error should be reported immediately as the primary issue, overriding any concerns about the anchor. The anchor check should only proceed if the HTTP request is successful (i.e., status codes 2XX), ensuring that linkcheck_anchors settings are properly considered. This behavior ensures clarity between different kinds of errors and addresses the user's issue regarding incorrect error prioritization."
