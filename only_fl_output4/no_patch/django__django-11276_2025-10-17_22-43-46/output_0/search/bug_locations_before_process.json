        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior after resolving the issue is for the `escape` method to utilize Python's standard library function `html.escape()` rather than its current implementation. This change aims to preserve the existing functionality of escaping ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe HTML use, while potentially improving performance as indicated by Python's documentation and the mentioned Python bug tracker issue.\n\nThe `escape` function will need to be updated to call `html.escape()`, with careful attention to ensure that it still returns a string marked as safe by Django's `mark_safe` (or ensuring that `html.escape()`'s output is compatible with Django's safety mechanisms). Special consideration should be given to the handling of single quotes, ensuring that the functional behavior does not change for Django developers relying on the current output.\n\nThis change will effectively leverage the wider community-maintained version of the escape functionality, reduce code duplication within Django, and potentially yield performance benefits as highlighted in the original issue description."
