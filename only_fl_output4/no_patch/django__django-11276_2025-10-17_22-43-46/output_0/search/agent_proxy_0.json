Based on the issue description, the key points of interest are:\n\n1. The implementation of `django.utils.html.escape()`.\n2. Any usage of `html.escape()` that might already exist for comparison or reference.\n3. Performance metrics or code comments that justify the current implementation, if available.\n\nGiven these requirements, here are the API calls I will use to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")` - This will help us find the definition of `escape()` within `django.utils.html`, which is the direct target of the issue.\n2. `search_code(\"html.escape\")` - To check if `html.escape()` from Python's standard library is already being used elsewhere in the Django project, which might give us insights into compatibility or precedent.\n3. `search_code_in_file(\"from django.utils.html import escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")` - This is to see if there are any self-references within the module that might need to be updated or are relevant to understanding the current implementation.\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid foundation of code context to begin addressing the issue."
