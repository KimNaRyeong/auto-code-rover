We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n"

If the prior implementation did not expose the issue due to either an environmental setup or incorrect assumptions, let's adjust the scope based on your instructions.\n\nGiven your goal is to test the performance and output discrepancy between Django's `escape` function and Python's standard library `html.escape` function, and that the previous implementation exited with code `0` without raising an `AssertionError`, it implies that adjustments are needed. \n\nThis revised `reproducer.py` script specifically targets the reproduction of the alleged issue, taking into consideration:\n\n1. Strictly testing for performance improvement claims.\n2. Explicitly checking for the stated minor output discrepancy (`&#39;` vs. `&#x27;`).\n\nPlease note, for this script to run, you need a Django environment setup due to the dependency on `from django.utils.html import escape`.\n\n```python\nimport timeit\nimport html\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        from django.utils.html import escape as django_escape\n\n        test_string = \"copyright <&> 'quotes'\"\n\n        django_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: django_escape(test_string), number=100000)\n        html_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: html.escape(test_string), number=100000)\n\n        if html_time >= django_time:\n            raise AssertionError(\"html.escape() performance is not better than Django's escape().\")\n\n        django_output = django_escape(test_string)\n        html_output = html.escape(test_string)\n\n        if django_output.replace(\"&#39;\", \"&#x27;\") != html_output:\n            raise AssertionError(\"html.escape() output does not match Django's escape() after normalization.\")\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Exits with error code 1 if issue is present\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An unexpected error occurred:\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n    print(\"No issues detected.\", exit(0))\n```\n\nThis script attempts to more closely validate the issue at hand: checking for performance discrepancies and output differences between Django's and the standard library's `escape()` functions.

Conversely, if no problems are found (indicating the issue is effectively resolved or non-existent under the test conditions), it will print \"No issues detected.\" and exit with code `0`."
