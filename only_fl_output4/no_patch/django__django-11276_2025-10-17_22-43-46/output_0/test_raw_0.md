Below is a standalone `reproducer.py` Python file designed to reproduce the issue as per your instructions. This script will import the `escape` function from `django.utils.html`, apply it to a test string, and compare the output to what the built-in `html.escape` function from the Python standard library produces. The goal is to assert whether replacing Django's custom `escape` function with Python's built-in `html.escape` would lead to any discrepancies or improvements as described, specifically in terms of performance and output.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_html_escape_speed_and_output():
    import timeit
    import html
    try:
        # Trying to import Django's escape function
        from django.utils.html import escape as django_escape

        # Test case
        test_string = "copyright <&> 'quotes'"

        # Testing the speed and output of Django's escape function
        django_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: django_escape(test_string), number=100000)
        django_output = django_escape(test_string)

        # Testing the speed and output of Python standard library's escape function
        stdlib_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: html.escape(test_string), number=100000)
        stdlib_output = html.escape(test_string)

        # Assertion for performance improvement
        assert stdlib_time < django_time, "Python standard library's html.escape() is not faster."

        # Assertion for output compatibility - Note: This is a simplistic comparison.
        # One could enhance this by converting entities back and comparing semantic equivalence.
        assert django_output.replace("&#39;", "&#x27;") == stdlib_output, "Outputs are not equivalent."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_html_escape_speed_and_output()
```

How it works:
- This script defines a `test_html_escape_speed_and_output` function that imports and applies both Django's and Python standard library's `escape` functions to a test string.
- It measures the performance of both and asserts whether the standard library's version is faster as well as if the outputs are equivalent after normalization (since there's a known discrepancy in the encoding of single quotes).
- The script uses `assert` statements to check these conditions, which will raise an `AssertionError` if the condition is not met.
- If an `AssertionError` is caught, it will print a stack trace specifically detailing where the assertion failed.
- Run this script in a Django project environment where `django.utils.html` is accessible.
- The script exits with code `0` if no exception is raised (indicating the potential issue is resolved or not present), otherwise, it will raise an AssertionError showing the problem.
