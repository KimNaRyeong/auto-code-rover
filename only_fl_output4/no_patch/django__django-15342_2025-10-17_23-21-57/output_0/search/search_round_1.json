        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls, we can distill significant insights concerning the issue and its broader implications within the Django codebase.\n\n### Analysis of `ModelState` Class\n\n#### django/db/migrations/state.py\nThis file contains the `ModelState` class relevant to our issue, where the `get_field` method is defined. This class plays a crucial role in Django's migrations system, representing the state of a model at a particular point in time. The `get_field` method, in particular, seems to be the crux of our issue, meant to retrieve a field by its name from the model state. Given the issue's description, the unintended behavior occurs when `_order` is treated specially based on `order_with_respect_to`, even in scenarios where it shouldn't, leading to a KeyError.\n\n#### django/db/models/base.py\nThe second `ModelState` class found in `django/db/models/base.py` relates to managing the state of individual model instances and is not directly relevant to the migration issue described.\n\n### Analysis of `_order` and `order_with_respect_to` Code Snippets\nThe various appearances of `_order` and `order_with_respect_to` in different files highlight how these are integrated within Django's ORM system. `_order` is used in multiple contexts, including model base definitions and proxy model fields, indicating its central role in ordering mechanisms. `order_with_respect_to` snippets located across migration and model definition files show its purpose in defining order in relation to another field within the same model or across related models.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug and Intended Behavior\nThe presence of `_order` without `order_with_respect_to` in models, especially in models generated by tools like django-simple-history, uncovers a scenario not originally anticipated in the `ModelState.get_field` logic introduced by the commit mentioned in the issue. The method's current behavior assumes that if `_order` is requested, it should translate to the field specified by `order_with_respect_to`. This logic fails when `_order` exists explicitly as a field without leveraging the `order_with_respect_to` meta option, throwing a KeyError.\n\nThe intended behavior, given the issue description, should allow `ModelState.get_field` to retrieve the `_order` field directly if `order_with_respect_to` isn't set in the model's options. This would accommodate models where `_order` is used explicitly as a field name, preventing the crash during migration operations like `makemigrations`. \n\nThus, the solution should involve modifying the `get_field` method's logic to more defensively check for the presence of `order_with_respect_to` in the model's options before attempting to substitute `_order` with the field it references. If `order_with_respect_to` isn't used, the method should proceed to return the `_order` field without alteration. This adjustment would align the code behavior with the broader expectations for handling `_order` fields in Django models, ensuring compatibility with models generated by tools like django-simple-history and supporting straightforward extension or customization of model ordering semantics."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Currently, the method erroneously assumes the presence of `order_with_respect_to` if `_order` is accessed, leading to a crash. To resolve the issue, the method should:\n\n- Check if `field_name` is `_order`. If so, it should then check whether the model's options include `order_with_respect_to`.\n- If `order_with_respect_to` is not present, the method should directly attempt to return the `_order` field from the model state's fields if it exists, instead of trying to map `_order` to another field name.\n- This ensures that models explicitly defining an `_order` field can still successfully retrieve it without requiring `order_with_respect_to`.\n- The solution should preserve the original functionality for models that do use `order_with_respect_to`, automatically mapping `_order` to the appropriate field.\n\nIn summary, the code modification aims to provide a more robust handling of `_order` by considering both use cases: when it's part of the model's ordering mechanism through `order_with_respect_to`, and when it's explicitly defined as a separate field. This approach eliminates the KeyError and allows both scenarios to function as intended during migration operations like `makemigrations`."
