Specifically, we are interested in the `ModelState` class, the `get_field` method within it, and the usage patterns relating to `_order` and `order_with_respect_to`. Here are the API calls that will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `ModelState` class within the codebase to find which file(s) it is defined in.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelState\")`\n\n2. Given that the new function introduced is `ModelState.get_field`, it's essential to look up its implementation. However, without knowing the exact file, the first step is necessary.\n   - Since we don't know the file path yet, we'll delay constructing this call until after the first result.\n\n3. To understand how `_order` and `order_with_respect_to` are currently being handled in relation to the reported issue, we should also look for any references or usages of these two within the project. This can give us insight into why the crash occurs when `_order` exists without `order_with_respect_to`.\n   - `search_code(\"'_order'\")`\n   - `search_code(\"'order_with_respect_to'\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the problem, including where the `get_field` method is defined and how `_order` and `order_with_respect_to` are being used or expected to behave in various parts of the project."
