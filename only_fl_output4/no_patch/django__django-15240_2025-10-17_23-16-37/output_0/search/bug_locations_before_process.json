This method, potentially named validate_migration_files, should compare the list of migrations recorded in the database with those available on the filesystem. If a recorded migration does not have a corresponding file, it should be marked for potential removal, considering the nuances discussed in the issue (e.g., handling squashed migrations and ensuring that migrations mentioned in the replaces list of other migrations are not prematurely removed)."

This ensures that the django_migrations table does not contain records of migrations that are no longer present in the file system. It's crucial that this adjustment is made carefully to preserve the integrity of the migrations process, especially in environments with multiple databases or complex migration histories."
