This script reproduces the mentioned issue by attempting to use `categorical_crossentropy` loss for binary classification with the HistGradientBoostingClassifier. The `main` function trains the model and then makes predictions, checking if the model correctly predicts the binary outcome when it should. If the model does not predict as expected (an indication that `categorical_crossentropy` does not handle binary classification correctly without raising an explicit error or generalizing properly), the script will raise an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, the script will indicate no issue was detected. Error handling is in place to provide a clear stack trace should an unexpected error occur during execution.
