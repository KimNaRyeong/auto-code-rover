Certainly! Considering the requirements and ensuring we are following the right approach to reproduce the issue effectively within the stipulated guidelines, here's how we can modify the `reproducer.py` script:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    import numpy as np

    X = [[1, 0],
         [1, 0],
         [1, 0],
         [0, 1],
         [1, 1]]
    y = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
    gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                                        min_samples_leaf=1)
    gb.fit(X, y)
    predictions = gb.predict([[1, 0], [0, 1]])

    # We expect one of the predictions to be 1, not both to be 0, as per correct behavior for binary classification
    assert predictions[0] == 1 or predictions[1] == 1, "Incorrect predictions: both are 0."
    print("The test passed, no issue with categorical_crossentropy on binary classification was detected.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print("AssertionError:", e)
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is reproduced

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script is designed to flag an issue specifically with the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function when used in binary classification scenarios with the HistGradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn. If the classifier fails to make correct predictions due to this setup, the script will acknowledge the presence of the issue by raising an `AssertionError` but exiting cleanly with exit code 0 to signify that the issue was successfully reproduced as per the requirements. 

In contrast, if the script encounters any unexpected errors (such as import issues, runtime exceptions outside the purview of the issue being tested, etc.), it will output a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the problem and then exit with code 1, indicating an abnormal termination due to an unexpected issue.
