Search for mentions or uses of the `replace` method in the `fitsrec.py` file to understand its usage and confirm the bug as described:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"output_field.replace\", \"fitsrec.py\")`\n\n2. Look for the class definition or any class that might use this faulty code, to understand its structure and how the method fits within it:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"class\", \"fitsrec.py\")`\n\n3. Check if there are any unit tests or any test code related to this functionality to understand why the issue is not triggering test failures:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"test\", \"fitsrec.py\")`\n\nThese actions are expected to give us an overview of how `output_field.replace` is being used, whether the faulty line of code is part of a larger method or class that's not properly covered by tests, and potentially guide us towards the parts of the code that need to be modified or more closely inspected to resolve the issue."
