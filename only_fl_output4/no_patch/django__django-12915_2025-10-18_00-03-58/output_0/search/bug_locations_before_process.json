        "intended_behavior": "The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class needs an implementation of a new method `get_response_async` to serve static files asynchronously in an ASGI environment. This method should:\n- Accept an `HttpRequest` object as its only argument, similar to the synchronous `get_response`.\n- Asynchronously check if the requested file exists and serve it if possible. This might involve adapting the `file_path` method to work asynchronously or ensuring file I/O operations are done in a non-blocking manner.\n- Handle exceptions (e.g., `Http404`) asynchronously, ensuring that appropriate HTTP response objects are returned non-blockingly.\n- The implementation should leverage Python's `async` and `await` syntax to ensure asynchronous execution through the method.\n- The functionality should mirror that of `get_response` in `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` but adjust for asynchronous execution. This implies utilizing `async` versions of necessary operations (like file serving and exception handling) to ensure compatibility with ASGI specifications.\n- This method will enable `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` to process static file requests efficiently and correctly within Django's ASGI application framework, addressing the reported issue without altering the existing synchronous behavior for other types of handlers or requests."
