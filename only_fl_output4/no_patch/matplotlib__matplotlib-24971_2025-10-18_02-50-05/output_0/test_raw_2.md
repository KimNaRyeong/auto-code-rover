In light of the previous complications, let's refocus on simplifying the approach while still using basic Python standard libraries without external dependencies for image comparison. We will utilize `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image comparison, which should be available in most environments or can be easily installed as part of standard Python distributions. This adjustment is intended to avoid the issue encountered with missing libraries.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_images_identical(img1_path, img2_path):
    from PIL import Image, ImageChops

    img1 = Image.open(img1_path)
    img2 = Image.open(img2_path)

    diff = ImageChops.difference(img1, img2)

    # if all pixels are black, images are the same
    if diff.getbbox():
        raise AssertionError("Images are not identical")

def main():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
    
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")

    try:
        check_images_identical("test1.png", "test2.png")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

In this revision, the `PIL` library's `ImageChops.difference` method is used to compute the difference between the two saved images. If there is any difference, the `diff.getbbox()` method will return a non-`None` value, indicating that there are indeed discrepancies between the two images, signifying the presence of the originally reported issue. This script exits with code 0 when no differences are found (i.e., the issue is fixed) and raises an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace if discrepancies are detected between the two image saves.
