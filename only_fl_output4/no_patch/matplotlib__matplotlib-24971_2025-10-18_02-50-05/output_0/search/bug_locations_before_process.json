        "intended_behavior": "When using savefig with bbox_inches=\"tight\", the method should ensure that layout configurations like \"compressed\" applied via subplot_mosaic are consistently retained across multiple saves of the same figure. This means that before calculating the tight bounding box, the method must reliably recognize and apply any custom layout settings (like \"compressed\") that were used to generate the figure. This would ensure that all aspects of figure layout, especially those affected by constrained_layout and specific layout requests, are accurately reflected in each saved file, without being forgotten on a second save. Any caching mechanism within savefig that might cause it to overlook layout updates on subsequent saves should be addressed to preserve these settings effectively."

        "intended_behavior": "The subplot_mosaic method may need a closer examination to ensure that when a \"compressed\" layout is specified, this layout preference is distinctly flagged or embedded within the figure's properties in a manner that savefig can unmistakably identify and respect on every save operation. While subplot_mosaic successfully creates a layout based on the user's specifications, ensuring that these specifications (like \"compressed\" layout) have a lasting effect on how the figure is saved, requires that such preferences are stored or communicated in a clear and persistent way. This might involve adjustments to how layout preferences are passed between subplot_mosaic and savefig to ensure consistent application of the intended layout settings across multiple figure saves."
