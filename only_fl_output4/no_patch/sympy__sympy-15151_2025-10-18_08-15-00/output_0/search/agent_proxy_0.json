The description suggests that we are dealing with a project that involves mathematical expressions, possibly in LaTeX or a similar format for displaying indexed variables. Therefore, we should focus on finding the relevant class or method responsible for this functionality.\n\nGiven the information, here are the API calls that could help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"pretty printing indexed\")`: This will help us find mentions of pretty printing, specifically for indexed items, which could lead us to the relevant part of the codebase dealing with the rendering or formatting of expressions.\n2. `search_code(\"x_{1,i}\")`: Since the user expects the indexed variable to be formatted as \"x_{1,i}\", searching for this string might lead us directly to the code handling such formatting or at least give us clues about the formatting conventions used in the project.\n3. `search_method(\"pretty_print\")`: If there is a method specifically named or containing the term \"pretty print\" or similar, it's likely involved in the formatting process.\n4. `search_method(\"render\")`: Considering that the issue involves rendering a mathematical expression, methods named \"render\" or containing \"render\" might be involved in the display process.\n\nThese searches should provide us with a broad enough net to catch the relevant code context needed to address the issue."
