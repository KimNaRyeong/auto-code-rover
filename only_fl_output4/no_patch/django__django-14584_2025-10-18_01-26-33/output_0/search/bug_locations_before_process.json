        "intended_behavior": "Modify or enhance the BaseDatabaseWrapper class to ensure that every logging output concerning database operations includes the database alias. This could be through a method that wraps logging calls or by adding functionality in existing methods that handle database operations (e.g., create_cursor, make_debug_cursor). Ensure the existing functionality, such as connection handling, query execution, and transaction management, remains unaffected by these changes. The specific modification would involve appending the self.alias content to logged messages in a readable and consistent format, particularly in operations involving data execution and transaction management."

        "intended_behavior": "In django/db/backends/utils.py, specifically within any methods responsible for executing queries or logging database operations (potentially in logging setups within cursor classes or execution wrappers), modify the log message construction to include the database alias. This alteration would directly address the issue by embedding the alias into SQL operation logs, thereby making the log output more informative for applications using database routing or multiple databases. The change should preserve all functionalities related to query execution, error handling, and other utilities provided by this file."
