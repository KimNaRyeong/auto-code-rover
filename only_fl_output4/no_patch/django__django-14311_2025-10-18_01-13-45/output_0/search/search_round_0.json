Given the commit mentioned in the issue details, it's relevant to find where this fix was applied and then analyze surrounding code to understand how the module name is processed for autoreloading.\n\nLet's break down the tasks and corresponding API calls needed to address the issue:\n\n1. The issue mentions a problem fixed by a specific commit but provides insights into handling the `-m` flag for autoreloading. Let's start by searching for the code related to autoreloading mechanisms in Django.\n\n2. We need to understand how the autoreloader is detecting and processing module paths, especially for cases using `-m foo.bar.baz`.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following API calls for gathering the necessary information:\n\n- search_method(\"get_main_module\")\n- search_method(\"runserver\")\n- search_code(\"autoreload\")\n- search_code(\"-m\")"
