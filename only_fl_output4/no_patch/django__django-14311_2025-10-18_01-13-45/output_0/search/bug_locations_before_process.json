The autoreloader should maintain the full module path as specified, without simplifying or truncating it, ensuring that changes to files within nested modules trigger a reload when running a server with 'python -m'. The existing functionality to watch for file changes and reload on modifications should be preserved, with improved handling for '-m' specified modules."

If there's any preprocessing or setup done by 'runserver' that might affect how modules are loaded or watched, it should be adjusted to correctly support the full range of module specifications allowed by the '-m' flag. This includes ensuring any paths or module names passed to the autoreloader are accurate and fully qualified."
