Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nclass TestFoo:\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod() -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod_inner(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_staticmethod_outer(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod(cls) -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod_inner(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_classmethod_outer(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n```\nThe most worrysome cases are `test_classmethod` and `test_classmethod_outer`, which are not discovered by pytest.

        "content": "To address the issue of inconsistent support for `staticmethod` and `classmethod` with pytest discovery and running, and considering the problem revolves around pytest's handling of these methods, especially with decorators such as `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, the approach should involve:\n\n1. **Discovering where and how `TestFoo` class is defined** to understand if there's any project-specific configuration affecting its behavior.\n2. **Finding existing implementations or uses of `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in test classes** to check if there's a consistent pattern or workaround already being applied elsewhere in the project.\n3. **Checking how pytest decorators are applied on static and class methods in other contexts** to see if the issue is specific to this scenario or a wider project-related or pytest-related issue.\n\nGiven these aspects, we'll use the following API calls for more context:\n\n- `search_class(\"TestFoo\")`: To find the definition and use of the `TestFoo` class within the codebase.\n\n- `search_method(\"test_staticmethod\")`: Since this method is mentioned to pass, locating its usage might help understand how it's configured or used differently.\n\n- `search_method(\"test_staticmethod_inner\")`: Given there's a warning when collecting this method, understanding its other instances or similar patterns in the codebase could illuminate the issue.\n\n- `search_method(\"test_classmethod\")`: Because this method silently fails to run, finding other occurrences or definitions can provide clues on whether its failure is unique or a common issue with class methods.\n\n- `search_method(\"test_classmethod_outer\")`: Especially since it also fails to run, understanding its broader usage might offer insights into potential misconfigurations or pytest limitations.\n\n- `search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\")`: To see how the pytest parametrize decorator is commonly used with static and class methods throughout the project, which may reveal if there's a specific pattern causing the issue.\n\nThis selection of API calls is tailored to cover the different aspects of the issue: class definition, method implementation, and the usage of pytest decorators which are crucial to uncovering the root cause of the problem and developing a comprehensive understanding for a fix."
