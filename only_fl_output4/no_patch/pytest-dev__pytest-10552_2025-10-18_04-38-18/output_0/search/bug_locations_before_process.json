The collection mechanism should be enhanced to recognize these methods as valid test cases, including the proper handling of static and class methods parameters when parameterized. This adjustment will prevent `staticmethod` and `classmethod` from being overlooked or mishandled during test collection, ensuring they are executed as expected."

The intended behavior here would involve modifying how decorators are applied to these methods or improving how pytest introspects and collects such methods, preserving their functionality while still allowing them to be parameterized and executed as tests."
