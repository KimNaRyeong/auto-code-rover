Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to verify the presence of the reported pytest issue with `staticmethod` and `classmethod` test discovery and execution. This script uses subprocess to run pytest on a dynamically created Python test file and analyzes the output to detect whether the issue exists. If the expected tests do not run due to the issue, an `AssertionError` will be raised, showing the details of the problem.

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script creates a temporary Python test file that includes a mixture of `staticmethod` and `classmethod` test cases, some of which are parameterized. After writing the test cases to a file, it runs pytest against it and analyzes the output. The script checks for specific warnings and the count of passed tests to determine if the pytest issue exists. If the issue is detected, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. If the tests pass as expected, indicating the issue is resolved, it exits with code 0.
