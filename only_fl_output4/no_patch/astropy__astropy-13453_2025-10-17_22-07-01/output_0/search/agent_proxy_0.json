Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Table\")`: This will give us an overview of the `Table` class where the write method is likely defined or overridden. \n2. `search_method(\"write\")`: Since the issue is specifically with the `write` method's behavior in the context of HTML output, getting details on all occurrences of this method might help identify the specific implementation or override that handles HTML formatting. \n3. `search_code(\"write(format=\\\"html\\\"\")`: This will help us find code snippets where the `write` method is specifically used to write tables in HTML format, which might lead us directly to the relevant part of the code handling HTML output formatting."
