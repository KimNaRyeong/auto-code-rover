Given the specifications and requirements to correctly reproduce the issue while accurately detecting whether the issue is present, the updated script accounts for potential project-specific nuances. This script will attempt to format a table for HTML output using Astropy and validates that formatting is applied as specified. If the formatting is not applied, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, effectively indicating that the issue is being reproduced. In contrast, a successful run without errors suggests the absence of the reported issue or that it has been resolved.

```python
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_html_formatting(html_content, expected_values):
    # Simple verification that expected formatted values are in output
    for value in expected_values:
        if value not in html_content:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected formatted value {value} not found in HTML output.")

def test_html_formatting():
    from astropy.table import Table
    from io import StringIO

    # Mock table data
    t = Table([(1.23875234858e-24, 3.2348748432e-15), (2, 4)], names=('a', 'b'))
    
    # Attempt to apply formatting
    formatted_column_values = ["1.24e-24", "3.23e-15"]

    with StringIO() as output:
        t.write(output, format="html", formats={"a": "{:.2e}".format})
        html_result = output.getvalue()
    
    # Verify if formatting is applied by searching for expected formatted values in the HTML output
    try:
        verify_html_formatting(html_result, formatted_column_values)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise AssertionError("HTML output did not respect formatting for column 'a'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_html_formatting()
        print("Test passed: HTML output respects formatting.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

This Python script, `reproducer.py`, aims to directly capture and document the problem as described, thereby providing a straightforward mechanism for detecting and underlying the presented issue. Running this script in the root directory of the Astropy project (or any properly configured Python environment with Astropy installed) will serve as an effective diagnostic tool. It will confirm whether the reported formatting issue in HTML output persists, adhering to specified formatting parameters.
