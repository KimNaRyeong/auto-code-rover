I understand previously provided script and instructions did not address your needs correctly, given the nature of errors encountered. Let's refine the approach considering the error details you shared. The issue seems to involve module import errors, particularly around `ssl_match_hostname`. Given that, and the requirement to exit with a status code `0` when fixed, and to handle the error otherwise, I've revised the script while maintaining the function to print stack traces as you requested.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to import the modules and methods that previously caused import errors
        from ssl import CertificateError, match_hostname
        from requests.packages.urllib3.packages.ssl_match_hostname import CertificateError, match_hostname
        from requests import get

        # Attempt a simple request that would cause the original 301 redirect issue with pyopenssl/SNI
        response = get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')

        # If no exceptions were raised until this point, we consider the issue as fixed.
        print("No exceptions raised. Exiting with code 0 as the issue appears to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred, indicating the issue might still be present.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # We expect an AssertionError if the issue is reproduced or another related error
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Execution Context:** This script aims to assess compatibility and error handling with the SSL configuration and requests redirection in a Python environment. It reproduces key steps that would trigger the original issue, focusing on both the importation of necessary modules (which was the immediate cause of failure in the attempt) and the request operation that led to the error. By catching exceptions and inspecting their nature, particularly surrounding SSL and redirects, it gives a more directed test towards the described problem.

**Why This Script:**

- It attempts to replicate the steps leading to errors, particularly around SSL and network requests (a central part of the described issue).
- It provides an immediate check for the specific problems (import errors, SSL errors, redirection handling) with concise feedback.
- It integrates error feedback directly related to the progression of exceptions that exemplify the described issue.

Running this script in your environment should offer a clear indication of whether the described SSL redirection issue persists, based on the ability to perform the operation and the occurrence of exceptions.
