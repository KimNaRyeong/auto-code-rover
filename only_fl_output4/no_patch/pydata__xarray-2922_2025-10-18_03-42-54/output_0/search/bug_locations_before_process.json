        "intended_behavior": "The goal is not to fix a bug per se but to extend the functionality of the `Dataset` class by adding a new method that can compute weighted averages. To resolve the issue, a new method named `average` (or possibly `weighted_average` for clarity) should be added to the `Dataset` class. This method should:\n\n- Allow users to specify the dimensions over which to compute the average. If dimensions are not specified, the method could default to computing the average over all dimensions.\n- Optionally accept weights for each dimension involved in the average calculation. These weights could be specified as another `Dataset` or a data structure of a compatible shape that maps weights to the dimensions or individual elements being averaged.\n- Preserve existing functionality by not altering the structure or data within the `Dataset` unless related directly to the computation of averages.\n- Efficiently handle missing data according to the library's or user's preferences, providing options to ignore or include NaN values in the weighted average calculation.\n- The method should return a new `Dataset` object containing the averages computed, respecting the original data structure's metadata, attributes, and coordinates whenever applicable.\n\nThis new capability will enhance the `Dataset` class by enabling more sophisticated data analysis directly within the context of the existing library's ecosystem, particularly valuable for users working with geographic or similarly complex datasets requiring weighted statistical computations."
