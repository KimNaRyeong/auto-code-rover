Based on your requirements for a reproducible test that should exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved and raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, here's an updated version of `reproducer.py`. This version attempts to reproduce the issue described where a fixed `Accept` header leads to a `406 Not Acceptable` response from the server. The goal is to ensure the script fails (i.e., raises an `AssertionError`) under the conditions described (issue present) and succeeds otherwise.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_request_with_accept_header():
    """
    Makes an HTTP HEAD request to a URL that is known to respond with 406 when an Accept header is set to a specific value.
    This simulates the condition where Sphinx's hardcoded 'Accept' header causes issues.
    """
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    
    # Headers as set in the issue
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
        'User-Agent': 'Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4'
    }
    
    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)
    return response.status_code

try:
    status_code = make_request_with_accept_header()
    # The issue describes getting a 406 Not Acceptable response, which is not expected behavior.
    assert status_code != 406, f"Failed: Got {status_code}, which indicates the issue is present."

    # If the issue were resolved (i.e., able to configure custom HTTP headers), a 200 OK is expected.
    print('The issue is not present. Exiting gracefully.')
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

This script will directly address the scenario described: attempting to access a specific GitHub URL with a problematic `Accept` header. The expectation, based on the reported issue, is that a fixed or incorrect `Accept` header leads to a `406 Not Acceptable` response from GitHub's server, which this script asserts against. When the feature to configure custom HTTP headers correctly is implemented and working, modifying the headers within this script accordingly should avoid triggering the `AssertionError`, and the script should conclude with the message "The issue is not present. Exiting gracefully."
