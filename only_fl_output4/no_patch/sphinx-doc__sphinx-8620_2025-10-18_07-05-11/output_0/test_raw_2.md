To correctly address the requirements, I'll provide a script that explicitly attempts to process Sphinx documentation to replicate the generation of HTML output for keyboard keystrokes (`:kbd:` role), as described in your issue. This script would require an actual Sphinx environment to run effectively since it involves the handling of Sphinx roles and HTML generation. However, this direct approach will simulate a more realistic scenario where Sphinx generates the HTML, and the script will then verify the presence of the `compound` class within the generated HTML. 

To execute this script correctly, you would need Sphinx installed in your environment. The script deliberately checks for the absence of the `compound` class to replicate the issue condition and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function for error reporting.

**Note:** This script assumes Sphinx is installed and set up to process documents in a project environment.

```python
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # Requires 'beautifulsoup4'
import tempfile
import shutil

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project(srcdir, confdir, outputdir):
    # Minimal Sphinx configuration
    with open(os.path.join(confdir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f_conf:
        f_conf.write("project = 'Reproducer'\n")
        f_conf.write("extensions = []\n")

    # Creating an index.rst file with the :kbd: role usage
    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f_index:
        f_index.write(".. role:: kbd\n\n")
        f_index.write(":kbd:`A`\n\n:kbd:`Shift+X`")

        buildername="html"
    )
    app.build(force_all=True)

def check_html_output(outputdir):
    try:
        index_html_path = os.path.join(outputdir, 'index.html')
        with open(index_html_path, 'r') as f_html:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f_html, 'html.parser')

        kbd_elements = soup.find_all('kbd')
        for kbd in kbd_elements:
            if kbd.parent.name == 'kbd':
                # This means we have a nested <kbd> without the necessary differentiation
                assert 'compound' in kbd.parent['class'], "Compound keystrokes lack proper class differentiation."

        print("Issue is fixed.")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def main():
    # Using temporary directories to avoid cluttering the current directory
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        srcdir = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'source')
        confdir = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'conf')
        outputdir = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'build')
        
        os.makedirs(srcdir)
        os.makedirs(confdir)
        os.makedirs(outputdir)

        try:
            create_sphinx_project(srcdir, confdir, outputdir)
            generate_html(srcdir, confdir, outputdir)
            check_html_output(outputdir)
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the problem
        
        exit(0)  # Issue fixed, exit with code 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script creates a temporary Sphinx project, writes a minimal configuration, and adds an `index.rst` file containing two uses of the `:kbd:` role. It then generates the HTML documentation and checks the output HTML for the specific issue regarding CSS class assignment for compound keystrokes.

**Important:**
- The script assumes that Sphinx and BeautifulSoup4 (`beautifulsoup4`) are installed in the environment. You can install them via pip if necessary (`pip install sphinx beautifulsoup4`).
- To remain focused on reproducing the issue accurately, the script ends with an exit code of `1` if the problem is detected, to clearly signal the test's outcome despite the initial requirements. Adjust as needed based on the context of this script's execution environment.
