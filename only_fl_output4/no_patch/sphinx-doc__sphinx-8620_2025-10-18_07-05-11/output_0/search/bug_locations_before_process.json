        "intended_behavior": "The behavior of the `KeyboardTransform` class needs to be modified to distinguish between single keystroke `<kbd>` elements and container `<kbd>` elements for compound keystrokes. This can be achieved by implementing the following logic within the class's methods responsible for generating `<kbd>` HTML elements: \n\n- **For single keystrokes** (currently represented correctly): No change is needed. The existing functionality, which assigns the class `kbd docutils literal notranslate` to `<kbd>` elements should be preserved.\n  \n- **For compound keystrokes**: Modify the generation of the container `<kbd>` element to include an additional CSS class, such as `compound`. The resulting HTML should look like this for compound keystrokes:\n  ```html\n  <kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n  </kbd>\n  ```\n  This distinguishes the container `<kbd>` elements from their child keystroke `<kbd>` elements, thus allowing for differential styling via CSS. The existing functionality for the child elements remains unchanged.\n\nThe **modification** requires examining and adjusting the method(s) within `KeyboardTransform` class that are responsible for generating the `<kbd>` HTML elements. The goal is to implement a conditional logic where, if a `<kbd>` element represents a compound keystroke (i.e., it wraps other `<kbd>` elements), an additional CSS class (`compound`) is added to it. This change ensures the structure and styling potential described in the issue is achieved without affecting the current presentation for single keystrokes."
