To do this, I will:\n\n1. Search for the command implementation to understand its current behavior and identify where changes are needed to support comparing to a specific settings module.\n2. Investigate how Django loads and compares settings to identify the best approach for implementing the comparison feature.\n\nI will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the command implementation:**\n   - `search_method(\"diffsettings\")`: This should help locate the implementation of the `diffsettings` command or references to it, giving an entry point to the relevant code.\n\n2. **Investigate how settings are loaded and compared:**\n   - `search_code(\"settings\")`: By searching for how settings are handled, this search can provide insights into how Django deals with settings modules, which is crucial for implementing the feature that allows comparing different settings modules.\n\nThese searches will yield the necessary code context to understand the current implementation and devise a strategy for adding the new feature to the `manage.py diffsettings` command."
