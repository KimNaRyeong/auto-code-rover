This modification should allow users to specify a custom settings module against which the current settings are to be compared. The parsing of command-line arguments within this class should be extended to accept and properly handle this new option. The existing functionality to compare against Django's default settings should be preserved, with this new comparison option being an additional feature."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement logic within or modify the existing settings comparison logic to compare the current settings not only against Django's default settings but also against the settings from the module specified by the new command-line argument (if provided). This likely involves dynamically loading the specified settings module and then performing the comparison as currently done with Django's defaults. The output should clearly indicate which settings are being compared (e.g., current settings vs. specified settings module) and present the differences accordingly."
