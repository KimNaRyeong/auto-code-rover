Given that `tick_params` is likely part of a plotting or visualization library (e.g., matplotlib), we need to find the class that contains this method and perhaps any subclass that overrides or uses it. Let's also search for where `tick_params` is called to understand its usage across the codebase.\n\nHere are the steps to collect the necessary code context:\n\n1.
