        "intended_behavior": "The method `tick_params` within this file should be enhanced to allow a `fontfamily` or `labelfont` keyword argument. This addition will enable users to specify the font family for tick labels directly through `tick_params`, simplifying the process of customizing tick label appearance without altering the global font family settings or manually setting tick labels through other more cumbersome methods. The implementation must ensure that this new kwarg is optional, defaults to not altering the font family if not specified, and integrates smoothly with the existing logic for handling tick parameter adjustments. The method should parse this argument and apply it to the tick labels' font settings accordingly. Care must be taken to preserve the method's existing functionality and only extend it with the new capability."
