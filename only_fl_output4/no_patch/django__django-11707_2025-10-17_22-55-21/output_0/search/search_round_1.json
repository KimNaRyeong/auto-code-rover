So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the issue at hand and potential avenues for resolution.\n\n### Subquery Class\nThe `Subquery` class, as revealed by the search, resides in `django/db/models/expressions.py` and inherits from the `Expression` class. This class constructs SQL subqueries. Notably, the search did not find a `__getstate__` method within `Subquery`, which suggests that the class inherits its serialization behavior directly from its ancestors, possibly `BaseExpression` or another parent class.\n\n**Relation to Bug**: The absence of a custom `__getstate__` method in `Subquery` means that when instances of this class are pickled, Python's default serialization behavior is used, which does not exclude the `_constructor_args` attribute mentioned in the issue description. This inclusion likely leads to the unintended evaluation of QuerySets stored within `_constructor_args`.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: To prevent QuerySets from being evaluated when a `Subquery` instance is pickled, a custom `__getstate__` method should be implemented in `Subquery`. This method would exclude problematic attributes like `_constructor_args`, preventing the unwanted evaluation.\n\n### BaseExpression Class\nThe `BaseExpression` class, found in the same file as `Subquery`, provides a base for constructing database expressions. It includes a `__getstate__` method, suggesting it somehow manages its pickle state, which potentially contributes to the issue when subclasses like `Subquery` are serialized.\n\n**Relation to Bug**: Since `BaseExpression` has a `__getstate__` method, its behavior affects all subclasses unless overridden. If `_constructor_args` is being handled (or mishandled) by this method, it could be the reason for the unwanted queryset evaluation upon serialization.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `BaseExpression` or `Subquery`'s handling of `__getstate__` should ensure that serialization does not trigger QuerySet evaluation. This ensures that developers can pickle database expressions without side effects, maintaining query laziness.\n\n### @deconstructible Decorator\nThe `@deconstructible` decorator found in several files, including `expressions.py`, is typically used to ensure that classes are correctly serialized by Django's migration framework. Its presence in relation to `BaseExpression` implies it's used to allow expressions to be deconstructed for migrations, which may inadvertently include QuerySet serialization.\n\n**Relation to Bug:** The decorator's application could inadvertently cause the serialization of more state than intended, particularly if complex objects like QuerySets are being stored in class attributes like `_constructor_args`.\n\n### QuerySet.__getstate__\nThe absence of a direct hit for this search might suggest that the `QuerySet` class doesn't define a custom `__getstate__` method, thus inheriting its serialization behavior. This lack of customization might be where the evaluation-triggering behavior stems from during the pickling process.\n\n**Next Steps Based on Analysis:**\n\n1. **Implement `__getstate__` in `Subquery`**: Given the issue description, a direct approach would be adding a `__getstate__` method to the `Subquery` class that omits `_constructor_args` from the serialized state.\n\n2. **Review `BaseExpression`'s `__getstate__`**: Understanding how `BaseExpression` handles serialization can provide insights into how potentially to adjust or extend this behavior in `Subquery` to prevent unwanted QuerySet evaluations.\n\n3. **Further Investigate `@deconstructible` and `QuerySet` Serialization**: Since the `@deconstructible` decorator and `QuerySet`'s serialization method (`__getstate__` or its absence) are implicit in this issue, understanding their roles more deeply could prove beneficial. For `QuerySet`, exploring how its instances are usually pickled (using Python's default mechanisms or through Django's custom paths) could shed light on potential solutions.\n\nGiven these analyses, to gain complete clarity, the next logical step might involve looking more closely into the `__getstate__` implementations in parent classes or related methods affecting serialization and deserialization behaviors. Further examining how `QuerySet` instances are handled during serialization (even without a defined `__getstate__`) and the specific role and usage of `@deconstructible` in this context, could provide the missing pieces needed for resolving the issue."

The method should ensure all other functionality for pickling remains intact, preserving all necessary state except for those elements known to cause the evaluation issue. This adjustment prevents the unintended side effect described in the issue, aligning with the goal that QuerySets passed into Subquery expressions are not evaluated when pickled.\n\n**Rationale for Bug Location Selection**:\nGiven the issue's description and the analyzed context, the primary source of the problem appears to be the lack of a customized `__getstate__` method in the `Subquery` class. This leads to the default behavior where all attributes are pickled, including `_constructor_args` which inadvertently causes the queryset to evaluate due to its inclusion in the serialized state. Implementing a custom `__getstate__` that omits problematic attributes while preserving necessary state for pickling addresses the core of the reported issue without altering the foundational behavior of queryset serialization and deserialization in Django."
