        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `__getstate__` method within the `Subquery` class to specifically exclude the `_constructor_args` attribute or any other attribute that might inadvertently lead to the evaluation of a queryset upon pickling. The method should ensure all other functionality for pickling remains intact, preserving all necessary state except for those elements known to cause the evaluation issue. This adjustment prevents the unintended side effect described in the issue, aligning with the goal that QuerySets passed into Subquery expressions are not evaluated when pickled."
