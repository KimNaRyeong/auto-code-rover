The fix should ensure that when a footnote is referenced multiple times, each instance creates a proper hyperlink back to the original footnote in the final PDF document. This behavior will require reviewing and potentially updating the way footnote references are translated into LaTeX, ensuring that each reference correctly points back to its corresponding footnote definition, without losing its numbering or failing to create a hyperlink.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sphinx/transforms/latex/transforms.py`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** In this file, the transformations related to footnotes must be revisited to ensure they accurately process multiple references to the same footnote. The processing should account for the reuse of footnote numbers in a way that does not break the hyperlink mechanism in the generated PDF. This might involve ensuring that the transform logic uniquely identifies and links each footnote reference back to its single source of definition, regardless of how many times or where the footnote is referenced within the document.\n\nThese locations are derived from the search results which highlighted the involvement of these files in footnote processing for LaTeX output. The intended behaviors aim to address the issue by ensuring that footnotes are correctly numbered, referenced, and hyperlinked in the generated LaTeX and ultimately in the PDF document, preventing the rendering issues described."
