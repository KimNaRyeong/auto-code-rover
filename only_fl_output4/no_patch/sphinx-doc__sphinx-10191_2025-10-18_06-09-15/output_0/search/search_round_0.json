        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of footnotes rendered as `?` and not creating hyperlinks when generating a PDF from `.rst` files using Sphinx, we need to explore the part of the Sphinx project that handles footnote references in the LaTeX output. Understanding how Sphinx translates `.rst` footnotes to LaTeX commands can shed light on where the bug might be. Since the issue revolves around explicitly numbered footnotes and their references, we will focus on locating the relevant segments of code that process these elements for LaTeX output.\n\nLet's start by investigating how Sphinx processes footnotes and translates them into LaTeX format. Key areas of interest would include the translation of `.rst` files to LaTeX, particularly how footnotes are handled. The classes and methods that handle document structure, parsing, and rendering to LaTeX would be of interest.\n\nHere are the search APIs I would invoke:\n\n1. search_code(\"footnote\")\n2. search_code(\"rst\")\n3. search_code(\"latexpdf\")"
