The fix should ensure that when a footnote is referenced multiple times, each instance creates a proper hyperlink back to the original footnote in the final PDF document. This behavior will require reviewing and potentially updating the way footnote references are translated into LaTeX, ensuring that each reference correctly points back to its corresponding footnote definition, without losing its numbering or failing to create a hyperlink."

The processing should account for the reuse of footnote numbers in a way that does not break the hyperlink mechanism in the generated PDF. This might involve ensuring that the transform logic uniquely identifies and links each footnote reference back to its single source of definition, regardless of how many times or where the footnote is referenced within the document."
