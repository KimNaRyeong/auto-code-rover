        "intended_behavior": "The `call_command` function needs to properly handle mutually exclusive arguments that use the same `dest`. The intended modification must ensure that when such arguments are passed to `call_command`, it systematically determines which argument was actually provided by the caller and correctly processes it using the relevant parsing function (e.g., `parse_time` or the custom `parse_duration_to_time`). This involves refining the logic that maps command line arguments to their respective handling functions, especially in scenarios where mutually exclusive arguments may overlap in functionality but diverge in expected input formats. The modification should preserve all existing functionalities of `call_command`, including its ability to process other types of arguments and options, maintaining its general utility for invoking management commands within Django applications."
