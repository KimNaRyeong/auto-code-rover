        "intended_behavior": "The method `Y` should be modified to ensure that the year is always represented as a four-digit string, even for years less than 1000. This can be achieved by zero-padding the year. Preserving the existing functionality, the method should continue to return the year from `self.data.year`, but with zero-padding applied to guarantee that the output is always four digits. This ensures that the year '45' is formatted as '0045', thus resolving the issue while maintaining the expected behavior of the `Y` method for years 1000 and above."
