        "content": "To gather enough context to address the issue described, we should look into the specific file mentioned in the issue (`contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js`). We'll need to identify how float values are currently handled in this template so we can understand the impact of using the `|safe` filter to avoid issues with `DECIMAL_SEPARATOR` affecting JavaScript syntax.\n\nGiven this, I will perform a series of API calls to find the relevant sections of code within that specific file and any related context in the surrounding codebase:\n\n1. **Search for any float value formatting in the specified file:** We should look for instances where float values are directly inserted into JavaScript code, which could potentially be affected by locale-specific decimal separators. This might be straightforward formatting or passing values to JavaScript functions or assignments.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(\"float\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")`\n\n2. **Check for the presence of template tags or filters:** Since the issue mentions the potential use of the `|safe` filter for these values, we should check if and how template tags or filters are currently used in this JavaScript template, specifically for floating point values.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(\"|\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")`\n\n3. **Identify any existing use of `|safe` or related template filters:** It's also worth checking if the `|safe` filter or any similar approaches are already employed in this file, either for floating point values or in a way that could be adapted for this purpose.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(\"|safe\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")`\n\nBy examining the results of these API calls, I aim to identify exactly how floating point values are formatted and embedded in JavaScript within `openlayers.js`, assess current usage of template tags and filters, and determine the feasibility and potential impact of applying the `|safe` filter as suggested in the issue. This comprehensive view will support in crafting a patch that addresses the issue without introducing any regressions."
