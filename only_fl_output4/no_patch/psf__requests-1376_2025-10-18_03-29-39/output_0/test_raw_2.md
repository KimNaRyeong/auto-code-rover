Based on your requirements, below is an updated attempt to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to explicitly reproduce the issue described, focused on the assertion failure within a multipart POST request handling scenario.

```python
# reproducer.py

import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def httpbin(endpoint):
    """Construct httpbin URL."""
    return f'http://httpbin.org/{endpoint}'

def test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames():
    try:
        r = requests.Request(method='POST',
                             url=httpbin('post'),
                             data={b'stuff': 'elixr'},  # 'stuff' encoded as a byte string
                             files={'file': ('test_requests.py', open(__file__, 'rb'))})
        prep = r.prepare()
        # Assert that the proper byte representation is found and the incorrect one is not
        assert b'name="stuff"' in prep.body, "Proper byte representation not in request body"
        assert b'name="b\'stuff\'"' not in prep.body, "Incorrect byte representation found in request body"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # exit with error code 1 if the issue is present
    else:
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed, no assertion error.")
        exit(0)  # exit with code 0 indicating success/no error if the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames()
```

This script aims to encapsulate the conditions under which the original issue occurs and verifies the presence of the bug based on the assertion behavior described. Execution results will differ based on the exact versions of Python and the `requests` library, and corrections or patches that may have directly addressed the reported issue.
