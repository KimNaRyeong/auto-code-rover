After updating these parameters, the method should emit a signal indicating the change. This signal should be caught by all connected scalar-mappable objects that rely on this Normalize instance, prompting them to update their visual representation accordingly. It ensures that any change in the normalization parameters leads to an immediate and synchronized update in all dependent visual elements, maintaining the integrity of visual representations across the application."

        "intended_behavior": "While the connect method itself may not be buggy, the issue lies in how or if it's utilized by the Normalize class and scalar-mappable objects such as AxesImage. To resolve the issue, ensure that Normalize instances correctly register change events with the CallbackRegistry, and scalar-mappable objects subscribe to these events. When a change event occurs (e.g., a change in normalization parameters), the connected callback in the scalar-mappable object triggers an update to its displayed data. This approach requires ensuring that the mechanism for emitting and responding to signals (perhaps via connect or a similar pattern) is robustly implemented and utilized within the codebase, linking changes in normalization directly to updates in visual representations."
