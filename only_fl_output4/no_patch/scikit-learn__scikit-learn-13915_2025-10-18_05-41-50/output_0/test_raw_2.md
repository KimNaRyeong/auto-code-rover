Certainly! Given the requirements and the function template provided for printing stack traces, below is the `reproducer.py` Python script designed to reproduce the issue as described, checking for the occurrence of `TypeError` when using `min_max_axis` with a large CSC matrix under specific conditions. The script includes the function for printing a stack trace for any uncaught exceptions that occur during its execution.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    try:
        # Importing here to ensure the error is caught if the import fails.
        from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    try:
        # Constructing a CSC matrix with int64 index dtype.
        X = sp.csc_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

        # Attempting to get min and max along axis 0.
        min_val, max_val = min_max_axis(X, 0)

        # Assertions to ensure correct output, will raise AssertionError if output is not as expected.
        assert np.array_equal(min_val, np.array([1, 2], dtype=int)), "Unexpected min values"
        assert np.array_equal(max_val, np.array([3, 4], dtype=int)), "Unexpected max values"

        print("No error. Issue not reproduced.")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        raise  # Reraising the AssertionError to honor your instruction for exit code handling.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Reraising to ensure any unexpected error is not silently passed.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except:
        # Ensures any exception leading to termination provides a non-zero exit status,
        # complying with the requirement for indicating an assertion failure (or other issues) via exit status.
        exit(1)
    else:
        # Exiting with code 0, indicating the absence of any errors (including AssertionError).
        exit(0)
```

**Notes:**

- This script is designed to be executed in a Python environment that matches the conditions under which the issue appears. Specifically, it's meant for a 32-bit Windows Python interpreter as mentioned, where the described `TypeError` would be observed.
- Proper exception handling ensures the script exits with code 0 only if no assertions fail and no unexpected errors occur, as instructed.
- It's assumed that the environment setup, including the presence of necessary packages (`numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`), matches the requirements to reproduce the issue.
