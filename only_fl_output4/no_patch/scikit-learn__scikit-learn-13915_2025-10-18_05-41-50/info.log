Additionally, there should be a check that throws a more descriptive error if the conversion or operation cannot be safely performed due to the risk of data loss. The fix must preserve the existing functionality of computing min and max for both CSR and CSC sparse matrices efficiently and accurately, without introducing significant performance degradation."
