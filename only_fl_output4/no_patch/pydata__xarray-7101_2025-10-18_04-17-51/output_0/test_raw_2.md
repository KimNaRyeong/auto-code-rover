Given the task and the provided function for printing exception stack traces clearly, below is a standalone `reproducer.py` file designed to execute in the project's root directory. It will attempt to replicate the discussed issue with `xarray` regarding assigning coordinates with multiindex and handling the AssertionError to flag when the problem exists. The process is detailed sufficiently to aid in debugging or confirming the resolution of the issue.

```python
# reproducerer.py

import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    ds = xr.DataArray(
        [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
        dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
        coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
        name="test",
    ).to_dataset()

    stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
    stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
        {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
    )

    # The original issue described results in an incorrect dataset state.
    # Here we assert the expected behavior, which is that the length should be non-negative.
    assert len(stacked) >= 0, "Dataset length is unexpectedly less than zero."

    print("Issue not reproduced, length check passed.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

This script aims to replicate the issue where assigning coordinates to a stacked `xarray` dataset leads to an invalid state, triggering a `ValueError` because the dataset length becomes less than zero. It includes checks as described in the initial problem statement, asserting that the dataset's length remains non-negative after operations that were previously problematic.

If the issue is active, the `assert` statement will fail, and the script will catch the exception, print the detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and exit with code `1`. If the behavior is as expected (i.e., no errors and the condition holds true), it prints a success message and exits with code `0`. 

This approach allows us to distinguish clearly between the issue being present or resolved based on the script's execution outcome.
