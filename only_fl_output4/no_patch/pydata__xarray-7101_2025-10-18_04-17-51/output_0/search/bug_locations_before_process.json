This includes the correct handling of multi-index coordinates to prevent inconsistencies.

It should accurately reflect the number of data variables, taking into account the correct '_coord_names' list to avoid negative length errors. Any calculations based on the differences between '_variables' and '_coord_names' need to ensure that only valid, updated coordinate names are considered, accounting for changes made via 'assign_coords' or similar operations."
