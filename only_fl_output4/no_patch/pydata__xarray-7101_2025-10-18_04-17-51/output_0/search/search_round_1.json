After assigning the coordinates, the dataset was in a state where its length was coming out as less than zero, which caused all sorts of issues.\n### What did you expect to happen?\nI think the issue is with the updating of `_coord_names`, perhaps in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/18454c218002e48e1643ce8e25654262e5f592ad/xarray/core/coordinates.py#L389.\nI expected to just be able to assign the coords and then print the array to see the result.\n### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example\n```Python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### MVCE confirmation\n- [X] Minimal example \u2014 the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.\n- [X] Complete example \u2014 the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.\n- [x] Verifiable example \u2014 the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt or [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/blank_template.ipynb), returning the result.\n- [X] New issue \u2014 a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.\n### Relevant log output\n```Python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"mre.py\", line 17, in <module>\nlen(stacked)\nFile \".../xarray-tests/xarray/core/dataset.py\", line 1364, in __len__\nreturn len(self.data_vars)\nValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\n```\n### Anything else we need to know?\nHere's a test (I put it in `test_dataarray.py` but maybe there is a better spot)\n```python\ndef test_assign_coords_drop_coord_names(self) -> None:\nds = DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# this seems to be handled correctly\nassert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {\"test\", \"time\", \"lat\"}\n# however, _coord_names doesn't seem to update as expected\n# the below fails\nassert set(stacked._coord_names) == {\"time\", \"lat\"}\n# the incorrect value of _coord_names means that all the below fails too\n# The failure is because the length of a dataset is calculated as (via len(data_vars))\n# len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names). For the situation\n# above, where len(dataset._coord_names) is greater than len(dataset._variables),\n# you get a length less than zero which then fails because length must return\n# a value greater than zero\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### Environment\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: e678a1d7884a3c24dba22d41b2eef5d7fe5258e7\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:14)\n[Clang 12.0.1 ]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 21.5.0\nmachine: arm64\nprocessor: arm\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_AU.UTF-8\nLOCALE: ('en_AU', 'UTF-8')\nlibhdf5: 1.12.2\nlibnetcdf: 4.8.1\nxarray: 0.1.dev4312+ge678a1d.d20220928\npandas: 1.5.0\nnumpy: 1.22.4\nscipy: 1.9.1\nnetCDF4: 1.6.1\npydap: installed\nh5netcdf: 1.0.2\nh5py: 3.7.0\nNio: None\nzarr: 2.13.2\ncftime: 1.6.2\nnc_time_axis: 1.4.1\nPseudoNetCDF: 3.2.2\nrasterio: 1.3.1\ncfgrib: 0.9.10.1\niris: 3.3.0\nbottleneck: 1.3.5\ndask: 2022.9.1\ndistributed: 2022.9.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.0\ncartopy: 0.21.0\nseaborn: 0.12.0\nnumbagg: 0.2.1\nfsspec: 2022.8.2\ncupy: None\npint: 0.19.2\nsparse: 0.13.0\nflox: 0.5.9\nnumpy_groupies: 0.9.19\nsetuptools: 65.4.0\npip: 22.2.2\nconda: None\npytest: 7.1.3\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context:\n\n### 1. Code around `coordinates.py` line 389:\n\nThis part of the code within `coordinates.py` is inside the method `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords`, which appears to drop variables in the provided set of coordinates and any associated variables as well. This behavior is crucial for maintaining the integrity of DataArray or Dataset objects when their multi-index coordinates are modified. The method adjusts both `_coords` and `_indexes` attributes of the `_data` object, ensuring they're synchronized with the changes.\n\n#### Relation to the Bug:\n\nThe bug description suggests an issue arises after using `assign_coords` on a stacked Dataset, leading to an inconsistency in dataset length calculation. Given the modification of `_coords` and `_indexes` here, if `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords` doesn't correctly update these or if it erroneously drops necessary data, it could contribute to the bug. The method directly relates to how coordinate data is treated, which is central to the issue.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\nThe method should ensure that when coordinates are updated, especially multi-index coordinates, the Dataset's internal representation (_coords and _indexes) remains consistent, preventing anomalies like negative lengths. Correctly managing the drop of multi-index coordinates would ensure that all parts of the dataset reflect the intended structure and content, following modifications.\n\n### 2. `assign_coords` Method:\n\n`assign_coords` is found in both `groupby.py` and `common.py`. This method is likely responsible for allowing users to assign new coordinates to a DataArray or Dataset. The correct function of this method is critical since it's directly involved in the action that leads to the broken state described in the issue.\n\n#### Relation to the Bug:\n\nSince the problem occurs after using `assign_coords`, the implementation of this method in either `groupby.py` or `common.py` is likely where the issue might be found. The method should update all relevant metadata and container attributes to reflect the new state correctly. If `_coord_names` is not properly updated during this process, it could lead to the inconsistencies observed by the user.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\n`assign_coords` should allow for the seamless updating of coordinate values without disrupting the integrity of the Dataset or DataArray. It should ensure that all related attributes, particularly those involved in determining the length (`_coord_names`), are correctly updated to reflect the new coordinates.\n\n### 3. `__len__` Methods:\n\nWith multiple `__len__` methods found, particularly within `dataset.py` which is mentioned in the traceback, this method's role in calculating the Dataset's length is directly related to the issue. The ValueError indicating a negative length suggests a faulty calculation within or affected by the `__len__` method.\n\n#### Relation to the Bug:\n\nThe error arises when attempting to derive the length of the modified Dataset. Thus, the implementation of `__len__` in `dataset.py` likely relies on the dataset's structure, which becomes inconsistent or improperly updated after `assign_coords` operation, particularly with respect to `_coord_names`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\nThe `__len__` method should accurately reflect the number of data variables in the dataset. If the updating of coordinates leads to an incorrect calculation here, it's indicative of a broader issue with how coordinate modifications are managed and reflected across the dataset's properties.\n\n---\n\nGiven this analysis, further investigation is justified into the implementations of `assign_coords` in `common.py` and `groupby.py`, as well as the `__len__` method in `dataset.py`. Understanding how `assign_coords` updates the dataset, specifically with respect to `_coord_names`, and how `__len__` calculates the dataset's length based on this information, will be critical in resolving the issue."

It must ensure that no essential data is erroneously removed, maintaining the integrity of `_coords` and `_indexes` to reflect accurately the Dataset's structure after modification. The coordinate names (`_coord_names`) should update correspondingly to ensure that dataset length calculations remain valid.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/common.py` and/or `xarray/core/groupby.py`\n  - **Method:** `assign_coords`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The implementation of `assign_coords` must ensure that it properly updates the `_coord_names` and any other related dataset structure attributes when new coordinates are assigned. This includes the correct handling of multi-index coordinates to prevent inconsistencies. The method should safeguard against any actions that could lead to incorrect dataset length calculations, ensuring that modifications reflect accurately without causing errors such as negative lengths.\n\n- **Bug Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n  - **Method:** `__len__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method's calculation should robustly handle cases where the dataset's structure has been modified, such as after assigning new coordinates. It should accurately reflect the number of data variables, taking into account the correct `_coord_names` list to avoid negative length errors. Any calculations based on the differences between `_variables` and `_coord_names` need to ensure that only valid, updated coordinate names are considered, accounting for changes made via `assign_coords` or similar operations.\n\nThese locations are key to addressing the reported issue. Resolving the bug involves ensuring that coordinate assignment and management operations do not inadvertently disrupt the dataset's internal consistency, particularly regarding how dataset length is computed."
