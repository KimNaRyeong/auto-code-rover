### Instructions and Notes:
- This script attempts to reproduce the issue reported with the Sphinx autodoc extension, specifically the handling of generically-typed classes.
- It initializes a minimal Sphinx setup programmatically, aiming to replicate the environment where the issue occurs.
- Should the script encounter a `TypeError` as described, it prints a stack trace for debugging purposes.
- Successful execution implies either no exception is raised during the attempt to build the documentation or that the logs do not contain the specific `TypeError` mentioned.
- The presence of an error is explicitly asserted, causing the script to exit with an error state if the issue persists.
- Note that for this script to execute as intended, you may need to adjust the `conf_dir` and ensure the Sphinx configuration files are present and correctly set up in the script's directory. Also, the actual Sphinx error log name or path might differ (`sphinx-err.log` is used here as a placeholder based on the given task context, and it's assumed to capture relevant Sphinx build errors).
