This involves checking the type of the object being stringified and applying an appropriate conversion method to handle `TypeVar` objects, thus preserving the functionality of documenting generic types accurately."

        "intended_behavior": "These methods must be refined to handle generically typed classes and members correctly. Specifically, they should properly interpret and document `TypeVar` and generic types without resulting in `TypeError`. This means when extracting and adding documentation content, any `TypeVar` related to a member should be processed to display its defined constrains or bound types accurately in the documentation. Additionally, enhancing the conditional logic in `can_document_member` to detect and affirm the documentability of members with generic types would ensure that all relevant parts of generically-typed classes are included in the Sphinx documentation output."
