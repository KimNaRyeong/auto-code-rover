The adjustment should ensure that `kwargs` passed to the context do not automatically convert into `SimpleLazyObject` without explicit developer intention. This might involve providing a mechanism or documentation guideline on how to explicitly declare which `kwargs` should be passed to the context or adding an explicit processing step within `get_context_data` to safely handle `SimpleLazyObject` types, ensuring they are converted to a more compatible type (e.g., string) when necessary. The solution should preserve the flexibility for developers to pass additional context to their templates while avoiding unforeseen errors due to type mismatches."

        "intended_behavior": "Assuming `ContextMixin` is where `get_context_data` is defined or primarily modified for use by `TemplateView` and possibly other views, it is critical to ensure that this method either avoids automatically passing `kwargs` into the context without explicit conversion or provides developers with the tools to manage this behavior themselves. If `ContextMixin` indeed controls the population of context data from `kwargs`, an update here would potentially resolve the inconsistency across different views like `TemplateView` and `ListView`. The behavior to introduce could include clearer handling or documentation about how `kwargs` are to be handled when constructing the context, possibly including a check or filter mechanism to convert or ignore `SimpleLazyObject` instances unless they are explicitly needed and requested by the developer."
