        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit. In other words, I expect the following output:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\nThe code snippet above produces the following output for me:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.03125]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nDarwin-16.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n('Python', '2.7.11 | 64-bit | (default, Jun 11 2016, 03:41:56) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]')\n('NumPy', '1.11.3')\n('SciPy', '0.19.0')\n('Scikit-Learn', '0.18.1')\n```\n[WIP] Stable and fast float32 implementation of euclidean_distances\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\nFixes #9354\nSuperseds PR #10069\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\nThese commits implement a block-wise casting to float64 and uses the older code to compute the euclidean distance matrix on the blocks. This is done useing only a fixed amount of additional (temporary) memory.\n#### Any other comments?\nThis code implements several optimizations:\n* since the distance matrix is symmetric when `X is Y`, copy the blocks of the upper triangle to the lower triangle;\n* compute the optimal block size that would use most of the allowed additional memory;\n* cast blocks of `{X,Y}_norm_squared` to float64;\n* precompute blocks of `X_norm_squared` if not given so it gets reused through the iterations over `Y`;\n* swap `X` and `Y` when `X_norm_squared` is given, but not `Y_norm_squared`.\nNote that all the optimizations listed here have proven useful in a benchmark. The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

It supports various metrics, such as 'euclidean', 'cityblock', 'cosine', etc. The function can handle both dense and sparse matrices to some extent and has mechanisms for parallel computation.\n   - For the 'euclidean' metric, it's not using a straightforward `sqrt(sum((x-y)**2))` computation but relies on optimized routines, possibly `cdist` or `pdist` from `scipy.spatial.distance`, and other preprocessing steps.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue is related to numerical precision discrepancies between `float64` and `float32` data types when computing 'euclidean' distances using `pairwise_distances`. The bug might reside in the way data types are handled or processed throughout this function, or possibly in the dependency on `scipy.spatial.distance`'s `cdist` or `pdist` which might handle precision differently for `float32`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is for `pairwise_distances` to produce consistent results with `np.linalg.norm` for both `float64` and `float32` data types, maintaining numerical precision as much as possible and returning similar or matching results to manual computation using `sqrt(sum((x-y)**2))`.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nThe search for \"block-wise casting\" did not return any results, and neither did the search for direct computation like `sqrt(sum((x-y)**2))`. However, the absence of these specific searches in the results might indicate either that such functionality is implemented with different terminology or that the precision issue stems more from how data types and intermediate computations are managed rather than a specific implementation detail.\n\nGiven the mentioned optimizations and routines, such as handling `X_norm_squared`, it's important to understand how these parts relate to `pairwise_distances` and could influence precision:\n\n- **Further API Calls:**\n  - Investigate how `X_norm_squared` is processed within `pairwise_distances`. Given the importance of `X_norm_squared` in the issue's description and its relation to the computation of distances, it would be beneficial to explore how this variable is calculated and utilized, especially in the context of ensuring precision for different data types.\n  - Since \"block-wise casting\" did not yield results, consider looking into any portion of the code that might handle dtype conversions or ensure precision, but with different terminology. \n  - Explore the handling of different data types (`float32` vs. `float64`) within `pairwise_distances` or its dependent routines to understand where precision might be lost.\n\n- **Specific APIs to Call Next:**\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"dtype=\", \"sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py\")`: This could help understand if and how data type conversions are handled explicitly within the context of pairwise distances.\n  - `search_code(\"X_norm_squared\", \"sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py\")`: Get more context on the use cases of `X_norm_squared` within the `pairwise_distances` function to see how it affects the computation.\n\nThese steps are designed to unpack the intricate details of implementing `pairwise_distances`, focusing on dtype handling and precision conservation which are key to addressing the floating-point precision issue described."

The intended behavior is to either improve the handling of `float32` types within the existing computation paths (e.g., by temporary casting to `float64` for critical computations and then casting back) or to implement a dedicated path that ensures higher precision for `float32` inputs similar to `np.linalg.norm`. This must be done while preserving the function's current capabilities and performance for other metrics and data types.\n     - The investigation suggests that when dealing with `float32` arrays, there might be an internal computation or dependency (potentially on SciPy's `cdist` or `pdist` functions) where precision is lost or handled differently compared to NumPy's norm computation. A closer look at how these dependencies are used, and how data types are managed during these calls, will be crucial. The code should maintain its current general functionality but add a layer or condition that addresses this specific precision discrepancy for `float32` arrays.\n     - Additionally, while the original issue description hinted at optimizations and a possible need for \"block-wise casting\", no specific bug related to these terms was identified from the available information. Thus, any resolution might involve adding or adjusting functionality around data type handling rather than modifying a specific, identifiable piece of code for \"block-wise casting\"."
