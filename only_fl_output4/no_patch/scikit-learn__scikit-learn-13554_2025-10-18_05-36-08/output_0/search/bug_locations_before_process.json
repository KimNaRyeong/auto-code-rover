        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the numerical precision issue with `float32`, the method needs to handle data types more carefully, especially when computing distances that are sensitive to precision, such as the euclidean distance. The intended behavior is to either improve the handling of `float32` types within the existing computation paths (e.g., by temporary casting to `float64` for critical computations and then casting back) or to implement a dedicated path that ensures higher precision for `float32` inputs similar to `np.linalg.norm`. This must be done while preserving the function's current capabilities and performance for other metrics and data types."
