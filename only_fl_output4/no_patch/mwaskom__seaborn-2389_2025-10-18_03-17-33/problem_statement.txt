ValueError: fill value must be in categories
In the  _preprocess_colors function, there is the code to replace na's with background color as the comment said, using `colors = colors.fillna('white')`, however, if the original colors do not contain the 'white' category, this line would raise the Pandas ValueError:fill value must be in categories in `Pandas 0.25.3`.
