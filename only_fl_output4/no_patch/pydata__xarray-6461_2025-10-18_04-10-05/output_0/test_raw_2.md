Given the new directive, it's vital to rectify the previous misunderstandings and present a script that will execute with the conditions specified, accurately reflecting whether the issue with `xr.where` when `keep_attrs=True` is given can be reproduced. 

The revised script now corrects any previous inputs and focuses squarely on triggering the specific `IndexError` outlined in the initial problem statement. It will perform precisely according to your requirements: checking for the issue, catching the specific exception if it occurs, and using the provided `print_stacktrace` function for output clarity.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_where_with_scalar_and_keep_attrs():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        # The issue being tested: usage of xr.where with a scalar 
        # as the second argument and keep_attrs=True should not fail but currently does.
        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
        # If the operation was successful without raising an exception, the issue is presumed fixed.
        print("Issue appears to be fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        if "list index out of range" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        # The script exits with a non-zero code to indicate failure if it's a different error.
        raise AssertionError("Failed to identify the specific issue due to an unexpected exception.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_where_with_scalar_and_keep_attrs()
```

This Python script is designed to be placed in the root directory of the relevant project. When executed using `python3 reproducer.py`, it will attempt to replicate the reported issue with `xr.where` when passing a scalar as the second argument along with `keep_attrs=True`.

If the script successfully invokes the `IndexError`, it's a direct indicator that the problem persists in the tested environment, satisfying the initial reporting criteria. Conversely, should the script run without encountering the specific error, it implies either a correction of the reported fault or an environment where the issue cannot be replicated under the test's conditions.
