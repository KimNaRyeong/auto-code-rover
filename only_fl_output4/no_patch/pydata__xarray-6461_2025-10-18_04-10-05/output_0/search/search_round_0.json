        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about where the error occurs and related functionalities. Let's focus on understanding how `keep_attrs` is implemented within the `xarray` codebase, especially within the context of the `xr.where` function or similar functions/methods.\n\n1. We need to find the implementation of the `xr.where` function or its equivalent if the function is part of a class.\n2. Understanding how `keep_attrs` is used and implemented will also be crucial, particularly the lambda function that is trying to access `attrs[1]`, leading to an `IndexError`.\n3. The traceback suggests that the error occurs around an `apply_ufunc` call, which indicates a utility function is used for operations like `where`. Knowing more about `apply_ufunc` could provide insights into how it handles attributes, especially with `keep_attrs=True`.\n\nGiven the above, I'll make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"where\")`: To find the definition or implementation of the `where` function within xarray.\n- `search_code(\"apply_ufunc\")`: To understand how `apply_ufunc` is implemented and used within xarray, especially in the context of handling `keep_attrs`.\n- `search_code(\"keep_attrs = lambda attrs, context: attrs[1]\")`: To find where exactly this lambda function is defined and to gather more context around its usage."
