Given your requirements and factoring in the need to accurately reproduce the issue outlined earlier, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This script is designed to explicitly test the behavior of `xr.where` when using a scalar as the second argument and `keep_attrs=True`, expecting it to raise an `IndexError` due to the bug described. The error handling and output have been adjusted according to your instructions for clarity and accuracy in displaying the issue as it occurs within the context provided:

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_where_with_scalar_and_keep_attrs():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
        # Since the issue is with the keep_attrs=True parameter,
        # we're deliberately letting it proceed to catch and showcase the exact error.
        # The assertion is on the successful completion, suggesting a fix if no exception is thrown.
        print("Test passed: Issue is fixed or not present.")
    except Exception as e:
        if e.__class__ == IndexError:
            print("Test failed: Issue reproduced successfully. See stack trace below.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # To adhere to your requirements of raising an AssertionError to indicate a failure:
            raise AssertionError("Reproduced the IndexError as expected with `keep_attrs=True`.")
        else:
            # If any other Exception is caught, we didn't reproduce the initial issue accurately.
            print("An unexpected error occurred, which might not relate to the reported issue.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_where_with_scalar_and_keep_attrs()
```

Executing this script should behave as follows:

- If the error mentioned in your initial problem statement is encountered (`IndexError` due to `keep_attrs=True`), the script prints a detailed stack trace of the error and exits with an `AssertionError`, indicating the issue was successfully reproduced.
- If the operation completes successfully, it indicates that the issue may have been resolved, printing a "Test passed" message.
- For any error other than the expected `IndexError`, the script outputs a message indicating an unexpected error and prints its stack trace, helping diagnose any potential side issues or environmental problems unrelated to the specific `xarray` bug.
