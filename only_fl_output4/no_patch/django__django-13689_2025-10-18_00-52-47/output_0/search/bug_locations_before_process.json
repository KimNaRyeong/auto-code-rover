        "intended_behavior": "The `get_group_by_cols` method should ensure that when it generates columns for a `GROUP BY` clause, it accurately represents the entire expression, including any boolean conditions or comparison operations like `IS NULL`. This means, for expressions wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`, the SQL generated for grouping should not merely reflect the field being operated on but also the operation itself (`IS NULL` in the issue at hand). The method may need to be enhanced to serialize the full expression into the `GROUP BY` clause to accommodate scenarios where the grouping is not directly on a field but on an expression involving a field. Considering the complexity of SQL generation and the customization allowed by Django's ORM, the change should be made in a way that it doesn't disrupt existing functionalities for simpler use cases. The intended behavior should be to augment the current logic with the capability to handle expressions, specifically ensuring that additional conditions or modifiers in the expression are reflected in the SQL output without altering the basic grouping functionalities on direct field references."
