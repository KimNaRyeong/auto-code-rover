When encountering a `GenericForeignKey`, the filter should check for the associated `content_type` and `object_id` fields to determine if they are empty. This could involve dynamically checking if the generic foreign key is pointing to an object or if the `object_id` is null/empty, thereby respecting the empty or non-empty criteria without directly relying on attributes like `empty_strings_allowed`."

        "intended_behavior": "Although modifying `GenericForeignKey` directly to mimic standard field properties (like adding `empty_strings_allowed`) could resolve the issue, a better approach might be to ensure it can work with the Django admin filtering mechanism more seamlessly. This could mean providing a method or proxy attribute that `EmptyFieldListFilter` could call to determine if the `GenericForeignKey` should be considered empty or not, essentially abstracting the `empty_strings_allowed` logic in a way that makes sense for a generic relation. Instead of adding conventional field attributes directly to `GenericForeignKey`, enhancing its integration with Django's admin filters by either simulating necessary attributes or providing compatible interfaces would preserve its unique functionality while extending its utility in admin filters."
