        "content": "To address the issue of testing with `docutils-0.17b1`, we need more context about where and how `docutils` is used within the project. The issue description is quite broad and doesn't reference specific files, classes, or methods. Therefore, we should start by identifying the main touchpoints of `docutils` in the codebase:\n\n1. **Search for `docutils` usage in the codebase:** This can help identify which parts of the project depend on `docutils`. We can start by looking for import statements or configurations that specify the `docutils` version.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"docutils\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify main classes and methods dealing with `docutils`:** Once we know where `docutils` is used, we can drill down into specific classes or methods that interact with it. This step depends on the results from the first step, so it's a bit speculative at this stage. However, it could involve searching for classes and methods that process or render documentation, as `docutils` is often used for those purposes.\n\nBased on the issue's vague description, the initial focus should be on understanding how `docutils` is integrated into the project. With that information, we can make more targeted inquiries into classes, methods, and specific interactions with `docutils`."
