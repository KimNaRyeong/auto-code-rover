        "intended_behavior": "The `draw_text` method within the PDF backend should be updated or extended to include handling of the `QuadPoints` attribute for text elements with URLs. When text is rotated, the method should calculate the appropriate `QuadPoints` that define the actual, visually rotated clickable area for the hyperlink. This ensures that the clickable area for the URL matches the rotated orientation of the text, providing an intuitive user experience. The implementation should fall back to using the rectangular (`Rect`) clickable area in scenarios where `QuadPoints` is not supported by the viewer. This update should preserve all existing text rendering functionalities, ensuring that text appearance and other properties (like font, size, color) remain unaffected by changes introduced to support clickable area rotation."
