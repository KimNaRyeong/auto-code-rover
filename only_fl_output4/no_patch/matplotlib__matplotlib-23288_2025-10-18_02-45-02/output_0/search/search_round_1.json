QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get sufficient context for resolving the issue about the URL-sensitive area not being rotated in PDF outputs in `matplotlib`, I will need to explore how URLs are added to text elements and how PDFs are generated, focusing especially on any specific handling for rotation and the \"QuadPoints\" feature mentioned from PDF version 1.6. Let's proceed with the relevant API calls:\n\n1. Search for how text elements are created or rendered with URLs in matplotlib. Since the issue involves text rendering, it's likely related to the implementation of text drawing in PDF backend:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"draw_text\")\n```\n\n2. The issue description mentions the use of `QuadPoints` for specifying clickable areas in PDFs. This is probably handled in the part of the code responsible for generating PDF output. Let's search for any existing code related to `QuadPoints` to see if it's already implemented or if there's a function that might handle clickable areas in PDFs:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"QuadPoints\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue is specific to the PDF format and involves URLs, it's crucial to understand how matplotlib handles PDF rendering, especially concerning interactive features like URLs:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"PDFPages\")\nsearch_class(\"PDFFile\")\n```\n\n4. Given the specificity of the feature (rotating clickable text areas), it also seems relevant to investigate if there's any method that handles or modifies the \"Rect\" property for links in the PDF backend, as changing this could be related to implementing a correct rotation handling:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Rect\")\n```\n\nThese searches should give us insights into how the PDF rendering currently works for text elements with URLs, whether `QuadPoints` or something similar is being used or if there's room for introducing this feature to handle rotated text URLs properly in matplotlib's PDF backend."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights about the relationship between the reported bug and the existing codebase, as well as guidance toward possible solutions. Here are the findings based on the results:\n\n### Analysis of `draw_text` in `backend_pdf.py`\nThe presence of `draw_text` methods in multiple backend files indicates that text drawing functionality is implemented differently across various output formats supported by Matplotlib. Specifically, the mention of `draw_text` in `backend_pdf.py` suggests this is where PDF-specific text rendering implementations are found. Since the issue pertains to the behavior of text in PDF outputs, especially concerning clickable areas (URLs), the implementation in `backend_pdf.py` is directly relevant to the bug.\n\n1. **Role of the Code**: In `backend_pdf.py`, the `draw_text` method is likely responsible for rendering text elements in the PDF, including their properties such as content, position, style, and possibly hyperlinks (URLs).\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: The bug description highlights an issue with hyperlink areas not rotating along with the text. This suggests that the current `draw_text` implementation might not adequately handle the rotation aspect for hyperlink-sensitive areas or possibly ignores the `QuadPoints` attribute that could define such areas accurately post-rotation.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `draw_text` should ensure that any clickable hyperlink area defined for a text element correctly matches the visual orientation (including rotation) of the text in the PDF output. This means, after text rotation, the hyperlink area should also rotate accordingly to remain intuitive for the user interaction.\n\n### Understanding `QuadPoints`\nThe inability to find references to `QuadPoints` in the current codebase indicates that Matplotlib's PDF backend does not yet utilize this feature for specifying non-rectangular hyperlink areas in PDFs. This aligns with the reported issue, as leveraging `QuadPoints` could allow for correctly outlining rotated text hyperlink regions.\n\n### Searching for Classes `PDFPages` and `PDFFile`\nThe search for `PDFPages` or `PDFFile` resulted in no findings, which could mean that the PDF functionality is implemented with different class names or that we need a more detailed inquiry to identify the classes that manage PDF file creation and manipulation in Matplotlib.\n\n### Code Snippets Containing `Rect`\nThe extensive appearance of `Rect` across various files, particularly in `backend_pdf.py`, indicates frequent reliance on rectangular shapes for positioning, sizing, or defining areas within plots and components. These references could intersect with how hyperlink areas are presently delineated.\n\nGiven this context, subsequent steps for crafting a possible patch involve:\n\n1. **Inspecting `backend_pdf.py` more closely**, particularly its `draw_text` method, to understand how text and associated hyperlink areas are currently rendered and why rotation might not apply to these hyperlink areas.\n2. **Investigating alternatives or additions to the current implementation** to support `QuadPoints` for hyperlink areas, allowing accurate representation of rotated text hyperlink regions. This will likely involve altering how hyperlink areas are defined when rendering text in PDFs.\n3. **Reviewing Matplotlib\u2019s PDF rendering strategy** as a whole to ascertain the best approach for integrating `QuadPoints` or any similar solution, without disrupting other functionalities or backwards compatibility, especially for PDF viewers that do not support `QuadPoints`.\n\nTo move forward, a deeper dive into how `draw_text` works in the PDF backend and a more structured approach to finding or enhancing support for defining hyperlink sensitive areas in rotated text are essential."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

When text is rotated, the method should calculate the appropriate `QuadPoints` that define the actual, visually rotated clickable area for the hyperlink. This ensures that the clickable area for the URL matches the rotated orientation of the text, providing an intuitive user experience. The implementation should fall back to using the rectangular (`Rect`) clickable area in scenarios where `QuadPoints` is not supported by the viewer. This update should preserve all existing text rendering functionalities, ensuring that text appearance and other properties (like font, size, color) remain unaffected by changes introduced to support clickable area rotation.\n\nSince the search did not identify explicit handling of `QuadPoints` within the current Matplotlib codebase, integrating this feature will necessitate careful design to accommodate PDF viewers of different capabilities, respecting the PDF specification's guidance on `QuadPoints` and `Rect`. Additionally, thorough testing will be required to confirm that the introduction of `QuadPoints` handling does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior in the rendering of PDF documents, especially for texts without URLs or with other interactive features."
