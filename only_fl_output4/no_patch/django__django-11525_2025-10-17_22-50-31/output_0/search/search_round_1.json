This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us insight into how Django's `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions operate and how the `MANAGERS` setting is handled internally.\n\n### Analysis of `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()`\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - Both `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` are designed to send emails to the respective groups defined in the Django settings (`ADMINS` and `MANAGERS`). They construct an email using the `EmailMultiAlternatives` class, attaching an HTML alternative if provided, and send it using the `.send()` method.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The issue description points out that these functions don't validate the format of the email addresses contained within the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings before attempting to send an email. This lack of validation leads to runtime errors when the SMTP server rejects the malformatted recipient addresses.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The intended behavior should include a validation step for email addresses in the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` lists before attempting to send emails. If the format of any email address is not correct, the functions should raise a meaningful exception early, alerting the developer to the misconfiguration without sending an email. This early failure can prevent runtime surprises and make the configuration errors easier to track down.\n\n### Analysis of `MANAGERS` setting\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippet from `django/conf/global_settings.py` shows the default value for the `MANAGERS` setting, which is the same as the `ADMINS` setting. This indicates that, by default, emails for managers and admins go to the same addresses.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - Given that `MANAGERS` inherits from `ADMINS` by default, any format validation mechanism we consider should probably be applied equally to both settings to ensure consistency and prevent similar issues in both.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Ideally, when Django starts or when these email functions are called for the first time, it would validate the formats of the email addresses in `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS`. On detecting an invalid format, Django should raise an exception or issue a warning depending on the severity of the misconfiguration.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the lack of a pre-existing method named `validate_email` in the Django codebase (as per the search result), it might be necessary to introduce such a method or utilize Python's standard library (like using `email.utils.parseaddr`) to validate email formats.\n\nTo advance, I would:\n1. Investigate how other parts of Django manage email validation or if there's an under-utilized utility that could be repurposed for this case.\n2. Analyze how settings are loaded and validated during startup or when accessed to identify a suitable place for introducing validation logic without causing unnecessary overhead during runtime.\n\nThe next logical API call could be:\n- `search_method(\"parseaddr\")`: Searching for uses of `parseaddr` might reveal if Django already has a pattern for email validation hidden somewhere in its utilities or views that could be adapted for this purpose."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This validation step should check if each email address is in a proper format. If any address is not valid, the function should raise a meaningful exception detailing the invalid format. This early validation should prevent runtime errors during email sending and make configuration errors more apparent to developers.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/mail/__init__.py`\n  - **Method:** `mail_managers`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `mail_admins`, introduce a step to validate the email addresses in the `MANAGERS` setting before sending emails using `mail_managers`. This validation should ensure that all addresses are correctly formatted, raising an exception if any are not. This addition aims to identify misconfigurations early and reduce runtime issues related to email delivery.\n\n**Overview of the Intended Solution:**\nThe intended solution involves augmenting the existing `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` methods with an email validation step. This step should occur before attempting to send emails, acting as a checkpoint to ensure that email addresses conform to expected formats. The addition should be designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing code structure, preserving current functionalities like message construction and delivery, connection management, and conditional handling of HTML content. The validation logic could utilize Python's standard library utilities for email validation or any existing, though currently undiscovered, validation mechanism within Django itself, ensuring a minimal addition to the dependency footprint."
