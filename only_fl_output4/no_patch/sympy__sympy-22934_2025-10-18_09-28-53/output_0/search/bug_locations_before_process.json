This might entail adjusting the method to better parse or interpret expressions that involve division or multiplicative inverses, ensuring that `1/x` can be included and operations on such expressions yield expected mathematical results. The existing functionality for other types of expressions or elements should remain unaffected, preserving the method's ability to handle a wide range of mathematical objects."

This might involve modifications to how fraction fields are instantiated or to the underlying logic that determines element inclusion and representation within these fields. The changes should ensure that the domain creation and handling in SymPy treats fractional and inverse elements according to mathematical definitions, without disrupting the handling of other types of elements."
