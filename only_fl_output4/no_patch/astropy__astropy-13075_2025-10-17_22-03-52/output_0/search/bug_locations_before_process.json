This method should internally call `to_table` to convert the cosmology instance into an Astropy table and then use an appropriate representation to convert this table into HTML format, ensuring that mathematical expressions related to cosmology parameters are properly formatted using MathJax. The implementation must ensure that this new functionality seamlessly integrates with the existing unified read/write infrastructure, without altering the behavior of other methods."

This enhancement will enable parameters to be represented in a mathematically meaningful way when exporting to HTML format. The implementation should ensure backward compatibility and should not affect existing functionality where the MathJax formatting is not required."
