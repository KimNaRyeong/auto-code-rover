        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather context about how the `Cosmology` class interacts with input/output (IO) operations, specifically how it handles writing to files. We also need to understand how the `to_table` method is implemented and used within the `Cosmology` IO operations to leverage it for `write_html` method implementation. Additionally, analyzing how the `QTable.write` method works, especially with the 'html' format, and exploring how the `Parameter` objects store information which could be leveraged for MathJax formatting is crucial.\n\nLet's structure our API search:\n\n1. Get information about `Cosmology` class to find methods related to IO.\n2. Find implementations of `to_table` method within `Cosmology` IO context.\n3. Explore how the `QTable.write` method is implemented, specifically for the 'html' format.\n4. Understand how `Parameter` objects are defined and how the `format` argument is used, hinting at how we might incorporate MathJax notations.\n\nHere are the API calls for gathering this information:\n\n- `search_class(\"Cosmology\")`\n- `search_method(\"to_table\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"write\", \"io/table.py\")` (Assuming 'io/table.py' as a hypothetical path; we need the actual path for the `QTable.write` method.)\n- `search_class(\"Parameter\")`\n- `search_code(\"def_unit\")`"
