        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how the Astropy library handles cosmology data, metadata, parameters, unit definitions, and input/output operations. Let's dive into each part of the collected context to understand its role and its relevance to the issue at hand.\n\n### 1. `Cosmology` Class ([astropy/cosmology/core.py](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/tree/main/astropy/cosmology/core.py))\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Cosmology` class serves as a base for defining different cosmological models. It includes properties and methods for handling cosmological parameters, reading and writing cosmology instances to and from different formats, cloning, and checking equivalence between cosmology instances.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The `write = UnifiedReadWriteMethod(CosmologyWrite)` line suggests that `Cosmology.write` is designed to support various output formats through a unified interface, which is directly related to the feature requested in the issue: adding HTML export capability.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  Extend the `Cosmology.write` method's capabilities to include exporting cosmologies in an HTML table format, ideally using MathJax for nicely formatted mathematical expressions.\n\n### 2. `to_table` Method ([astropy/cosmology/io/table.py](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/tree/main/astropy/cosmology/io/table.py))\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  This method likely converts cosmology instances (or their data) into an Astropy table object. While the specific code snippet was not provided, its presence in `io/table.py` indicates its role in the serialization or summarization of cosmology data into table format.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  According to the issue description, `write_html` should leverage this method to get a table representation of a Cosmology instance, which can then be formatted into HTML.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  Serve as an intermediate step in the `write_html` method by providing cosmology data in a structured format that's easily convertible to HTML.\n\n### 3. Absence of `write` Method in `io/table.py`\nThis search didn't yield the expected results, indicating that our assumption about the location of `QTable.write` might have been incorrect, or it may not be straightforward to modify its behavior specifically for HTML outputs in the context of cosmology without additional context or implementing a new method.\n\n### 4. `Parameter` Class ([astropy/cosmology/parameter.py](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/tree/main/astropy/cosmology/parameter.py))\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Parameter` class seems to define properties and behaviors for cosmological parameters, including support for metadata such as units and value validation.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The `Parameter` class includes a constructor argument for `fmt`, which could potentially be used for defining custom formats, like MathJax, for each parameter. This is directly related to the enhancement of storing MathJax representations for parameters.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  Enhance the `Parameter` class to support formatting parameters in MathJax, which can be utilized when exporting cosmologies to HTML.\n\n### 5. `def_unit` and Units Handling (Various Files)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  Defines units and their properties, which is critical in a library that deals with scientific data. The snippets likely include definitions for standard and custom units, as well as their properties and relationships.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  While `def_unit` itself might not be directly related to the HTML export function, understanding how units are defined and formatted in Astropy can provide insights into how to similarly handle formatting cosmological parameters for HTML output.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  While not directly applicable to the new method, ensuring that any unit information associated with cosmological parameters is correctly represented in the HTML output could align with practices used in the unit definitions.\n\nGiven the collected context, the next steps could involve designing the `write_html` method to invoke `to_table` for obtaining a structured representation of a cosmology instance, enhancing `Parameter` with MathJax formatting capabilities, and exploring how existing unit formatting might inspire or integrate into HTML output formatting for cosmological parameters."

This method should internally call `to_table` to convert the cosmology instance into an Astropy table and then use an appropriate representation to convert this table into HTML format, ensuring that mathematical expressions related to cosmology parameters are properly formatted using MathJax. The implementation must ensure that this new functionality seamlessly integrates with the existing unified read/write infrastructure, without altering the behavior of other methods.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: astropy/cosmology/parameter.py, Class: Parameter\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Enhance the `Parameter` class to include an additional attribute or method that allows for the specification of MathJax formatting instructions for each parameter. This enhancement will enable parameters to be represented in a mathematically meaningful way when exporting to HTML format. The implementation should ensure backward compatibility and should not affect existing functionality where the MathJax formatting is not required.\n\nThese enhancements will resolve the issue by providing a direct way to export cosmology instances in an HTML format that is rich in mathematical expressions, enhancing the readability and usability of exported cosmology data."
