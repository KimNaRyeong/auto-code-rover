This would seem like the right thing to do in any case: the console output of a `pytest` run that is being uploaded is not Python code, but arbitrary text.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we should focus on the following areas based on the provided description:\n\n1. The location where `--pastebin` option is implemented and how it's used to submit output to `bpaste.net`.\n2. Examination of the `data` being passed to `bpaste.net`, especially related to the `lexer=python3` part.\n3. The suggested fix involves changing `lexer=python3` to `lexer=text`, so we'll need to find where this change should be applied within the codebase.\n\nConsidering these points, the relevant API calls to make would be:\n\n- To explore how the `--pastebin` feature is implemented, especially where it constructs the request to `bpaste.net`:\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"lexer=python3\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n\n- To understand how the `--pastebin` option is processed which might involve looking at the method implementation and any associated classes:\n  - `search_class_in_file(\"Pastebin\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n\n### Necessary API Calls\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"lexer=python3\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n2. `search_class_in_file(\"Pastebin\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n\nThese queries are aimed to provide direct insight into the implementation of the pastebin feature and how the lexer parameter is managed within the pytest codebase."
