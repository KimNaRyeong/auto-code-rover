The correct course of action is to find the portion of code that specifies `lexer=python3` for these requests and change it to `lexer=text`. This update should ensure that pytest's output is interpreted by `bpaste.net` as plain text, which should, in turn, eliminate the 'HTTP Error 400: Bad Request' issues."
