        "intended_behavior": "The code should ideally check for the existence of a 'locale' directory within each app directory and at the project base where `manage.py` resides. If it doesn't exist, it should provide a clear, actionable error message that guides the user towards solving the problem (e.g., suggesting the creation of a `/locale` directory or pointing out the necessity of specifying `LOCALE_PATHS` in settings). Additionally, enhancing the `makemessages` command to ensure it doesn't fail silently and provides feedback on actions taken or required actions if a failure point is reached would address the second part of the issue."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that default `LOCALE_PATHS` includes a sensible directory that can exist within a typical Django project structure, such as near `manage.py`. If a project-level `locale` directory is not included by default, updating documentation to clearly state where `makemessages` looks for localization files and how to properly configure `LOCALE_PATHS` could mitigate such issues. Moreover, enhancing the logic to include a fallback or additional guidance when no `locale` directory is found could improve usability."
