        "intended_behavior": "The `translate_url` function should be able to correctly handle URLs that contain optional named groups which might be missing in the URL pattern. This involves ensuring that: - During the resolution and reverse matching process (`resolve()` and `reverse()` functions), the absence of optional arguments should neither cause errors nor result in incorrect URL constructions. This might involve checking for optional parameters and ensuring they are either suitably ignored or default values are used if specified. - The function must preserve its existing functionality of translating URLs to a specified `lang_code`, ensuring that the translation is accurate even when optional arguments are not provided. - Modifications might include adding logic to check for optional arguments\u2019 presence in the URL before attempting to reverse match or ensuring that the reverse matching logic can intelligently handle cases where optional arguments are missing. Additionally, extending the error handling or conditions under which the original URL is returned could be necessary to cover scenarios involving optional parameters. - It is crucial to test with URLs that have optional segments both present and absent, ensuring that both cases are handled as expected without generating malformed URLs or failing to return a translated version of the URL when possible."
