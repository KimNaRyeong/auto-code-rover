Use _check_sample_weight to consistently validate sample_weight
We recently introduced `utils.validation._check_sample_weight` which returns a validated `sample_weight` array.

We should use it consistently throughout the code base, instead of relying on custom and adhoc checks like `check_consistent_lenght` or `check_array` (which are now handled by `_check_sample_weight`).



Here's a list of the estimators/functions that could make use of it (mostly in `fit` or `partial_fit`):

- [x] CalibratedClassifierCV
- [x] DBSCAN
- [x] DummyClassifier
- [x] DummyRegressor
- [x] BaseBagging
- [x] BaseForest
- [x] BaseGradientBoosting
- [x] IsotonicRegression
- [x] KernelRidge
- [x] GaussianNB
- [x] BaseDiscreteNB
- [x] KernelDensity
- [x] BaseDecisionTree

(I left-out the linear_model module because it seems more involved there)

Could be a decent sprint issue @amueller ?

To know where a given class is defined, use e.g. `git grep -n "class DBSCAN"`
