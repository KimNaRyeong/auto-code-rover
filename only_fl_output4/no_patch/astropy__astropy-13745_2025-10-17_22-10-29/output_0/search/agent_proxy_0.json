            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how the `Latitude` class and its `_validate_angles` method work, particularly how they handle precision and validate angle values. The key points from the issued description involve the `Latitude` class, `_validate_angles` method, and how the class handles float32 vs. float64 precision when checking value ranges.\n\nHere are the appropriate API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Latitude` class to understand its structure and any relevant comments or documentation that could hint at how precision is handled or could be adjusted.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Latitude\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `_validate_angles` method within the `Latitude` class to get its implementation details, which is crucial for understanding the validation logic that leads to the issue.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"_validate_angles\", \"Latitude\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions an error arising from using `Latitude(lat, 'rad')`, it might be helpful to review how instances of `Latitude` are initialized and how the unit parameter ('rad' in this case) is used. We should look into the constructor method of `Latitude`, which in Python is typically `__new__` for objects that inherit from immutable types.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"__new__\", \"Latitude\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will help gather the necessary context around the `Latitude` class implementation, specific to angle validation and float precision handling, which is essential for addressing the reported issue."
