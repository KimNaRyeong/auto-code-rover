        "intended_behavior": "The `_validate_angles` method should ensure angle validation accounts for floating-point precision differences. Specifically, it can incorporate a tolerance threshold when comparing angle values against the -90 and +90 degree bounds. This tolerance should be small enough to not meaningfully affect astronomical calculations but large enough to accommodate the slight inaccuracies introduced by floating-point arithmetic, especially in `float32` representations.\n\nThe modification should ensure that:\n- The comparison `np.any(angles.value < -limit)` and `np.any(angles.value > limit)` incorporates a comparison with a tolerance. For instance, using `numpy.isclose` with a suitable tolerance parameter for checking equality within bounds, or adjusting the `limit` to consider the floating-point representation error margin.\n- This adjustment preserves the method's original functionality for all valid inputs while allowing for the minor inaccuracies inherent in floating-point arithmetic. This means the method will continue to correctly invalidate genuinely out-of-bound values while accepting values that are nominally outside the bounds due to the precision limitations of their data types.\n\nImplementing these changes requires a careful consideration of the precision to ensure the balance between validation strictness and tolerance for floating-point inaccuracy, keeping in mind the diverse use cases of the `astropy` library in the astronomical community."
