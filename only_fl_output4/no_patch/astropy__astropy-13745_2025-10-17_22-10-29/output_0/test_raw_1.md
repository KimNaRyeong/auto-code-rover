Given the provided conditions and understanding that the initial guidance was not followed due to a missing module error (`numpy` not found), let's ensure the reproduction script is designed to operate in an environment where `numpy` and `astropy` are installed. If `numpy` is missing, it's likely a requirement in using `astropy` for dealing with scientific computations, so please ensure both are installed in your environment. Here's how you might adjust the script accordingly to ensure clarity in what is expected for installation:

```python
# reproduducer.py
try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print("This script requires both numpy and astropy to be installed.")
    raise e

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latitude_with_float32():
    lat_value = np.float32(np.pi/2)
    try:
        Latitude(lat_value, 'rad')
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Test Failed: The issue is still present.")
    else:
        print("Test Passed: No exception raised.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_latitude_with_float32()
```

This script now includes a prerequisite check for `numpy` and `astropy` at the beginning to halt execution with a clear message if either is not installed. This adjustment clarifies the expectation for the execution environment and could help avoid errors like the one encountered previously. Before running the script, ensure both `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in your Python environment by running:

```
pip install numpy astropy
```

This script does exactly as before: it reproduces the issue described with `Latitude` rejecting the `float32` representation of π/2. It tries to instantiate a `Latitude` object with a `float32` representation of π/2, captures the `ValueError` if thrown, prints a detailed stack trace including the line numbers and the code context where the error occurred, and raises an `AssertionError` to indicate failure. On success, it simply prints that the test passed.
