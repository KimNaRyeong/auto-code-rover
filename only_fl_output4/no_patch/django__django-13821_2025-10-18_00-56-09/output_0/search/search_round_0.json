Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015.

        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions less than 3.9.0, we should first identify where the SQLite version checks are made within the project's codebase. This involves looking for SQLite version comparisons, configuration settings that specify supported SQLite versions, or any setup scripts that perform version checks.\n\nBased on the description, it's reasonable to assume that the project performs some checks on the SQLite version at either initialization or when working with specific database features such as expression indexes or JSON1 support. Likely, these checks are done within the database initialization or configuration code.\n\nTo collect sufficient context for resolving this issue, we should use the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for code snippets** that reference SQLite version checks. This could be in the form of `sqlite_version`, `SQLITE_VERSION`, or similar strings that likely indicate a version check. Code snippets like these are often involved in compatibility checks or feature enabling based on the database version.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"sqlite_version\")\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_VERSION\")\n```\n\n2. **Look for configuration related to SQLite features**, specifically those mentioned like indexes on expressions or the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option. This may help identify files or classes responsible for database feature configuration and the related SQLite version dependency.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")\nsearch_code(\"indexes on expressions\")\n```\n\nSince the issue mentions reducing support for specific versions, any changes will likely be made within areas of the code that handle database initialization, configuration, or compatibility layers. Finding these snippets and related areas will provide a solid foundation for understanding where changes are needed.\n\nThese API calls will help in identifying the parts of the codebase that need to be updated or checked to ensure compatibility with SQLite version 3.9.0 and above, in line with dropping support for older versions."
