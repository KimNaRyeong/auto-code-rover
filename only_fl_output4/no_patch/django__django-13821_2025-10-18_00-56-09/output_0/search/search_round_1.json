        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions less than 3.9.0, we should first identify where the SQLite version checks are made within the project's codebase. This involves looking for SQLite version comparisons, configuration settings that specify supported SQLite versions, or any setup scripts that perform version checks.\n\nBased on the description, it's reasonable to assume that the project performs some checks on the SQLite version at either initialization or when working with specific database features such as expression indexes or JSON1 support. Likely, these checks are done within the database initialization or configuration code.\n\nTo collect sufficient context for resolving this issue, we should use the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for code snippets** that reference SQLite version checks. This could be in the form of `sqlite_version`, `SQLITE_VERSION`, or similar strings that likely indicate a version check. Code snippets like these are often involved in compatibility checks or feature enabling based on the database version.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"sqlite_version\")\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_VERSION\")\n```\n\n2. **Look for configuration related to SQLite features**, specifically those mentioned like indexes on expressions or the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option. This may help identify files or classes responsible for database feature configuration and the related SQLite version dependency.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")\nsearch_code(\"indexes on expressions\")\n```\n\nSince the issue mentions reducing support for specific versions, any changes will likely be made within areas of the code that handle database initialization, configuration, or compatibility layers. Finding these snippets and related areas will provide a solid foundation for understanding where changes are needed.\n\nThese API calls will help in identifying the parts of the codebase that need to be updated or checked to ensure compatibility with SQLite version 3.9.0 and above, in line with dropping support for older versions."

        "content": "Given the results from the search API calls, we have identified several references to `sqlite_version` in two key files: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py` and `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`. These files likely play a crucial role in determining the capabilities of the SQLite database backend within Django and how it initializes connections or features based on the SQLite version available.\n\n### Analyzing `sqlite_version` Code Snippets\n\n#### 1. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - This file likely lists or checks for features available in the SQLite backend used by Django. The matches for `sqlite_version` here indicate that certain database features are conditionally enabled based on the SQLite version.\n- **Relationship to the issue**: \n  - Since the issue calls for dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0, this file may contain checks against older versions that will need to be updated or removed. For instance, it could be enabling or disabling features based on version checks that no longer will be necessary for unsupported versions.\n- **Intended behavior**:\n  - After addressing the issue, the code in this file should no longer consider versions lower than 3.9.0 when determining availability of features such as expression indexes or JSON1 support. It might mean updating the conditions to start checks from version 3.9.0 and above.\n\n#### 2. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - This file probably handles database connection and initialization for the SQLite backend. The `sqlite_version` references are likely used to adjust SQLite database connections or configurations based on the version detected.\n- **Relationship to the issue**: \n  - Similar to `features.py`, this file's logic for handling older SQLite versions needs to be revised to align with the new minimum version requirement. It may involve removing fallbacks or adjustments made for compatibility with versions older than 3.9.0.\n- **Intended behavior**:\n  - The database initialization and connection setup should no longer include adjustments for SQLite versions below 3.9.0. The code here should either set a minimum version requirement at the point of connection or simply remove version-based conditions that cater to older versions.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the absence of direct references to `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` and \"indexes on expressions\", it's plausible these features are handled implicitly through version checks rather than explicitly called out by those names. Therefore, to understand how these features are enabled and how version checks are currently implemented, we should examine the specific sections of code referencing `sqlite_version`.\n\nTo get more detailed context, the next logical steps would be:\n\n1. **Review the specific matches in the identified files**:\n   - Use `get_code_around_line` on the files mentioned to see the actual conditionals or logic surrounding the `sqlite_version` references.\n   \n2. **Since direct references to feature flags like `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` weren't found**:\n   - We may need to consider broader searches or manual review within the identified files to understand how feature support is determined and applied based on SQLite version.\n\nBefore proceeding to make changes, a deep dive into each mention of `sqlite_version` in the specified files is warranted to ensure any modifications accurately reflect the new support policy regarding SQLite versioning."

To resolve the issue, it needs to update any conditional logic related to feature availability to ensure it begins consideration at SQLite version 3.9.0. Any feature checks or toggles that reference versions lower than 3.9.0 should be removed or updated to reflect the new minimum version. The intended behavior is to have the code logic accurately reflect that features supported from SQLite 3.9.0 onwards are available without checking for versions below this threshold.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: \n    In this file, SQLite database connection or configurations might be adjusted based on the detected SQLite version. To address the issue, any logic here that adjusts settings or behavior based on being lower than SQLite version 3.9.0 needs to be removed or updated. This could include removing outdated compatibility patches or version-based conditional logic that are now unnecessary given the updated version support policy. The intended behavior is simple: ensure that the database connections and initial configurations operate with the assumption that the SQLite version is at least 3.9.0, thereby possibly simplifying the code and improving overall project maintainability."
