The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\nif expr.contains_aggregate:\ncontinue\nif is_ref:\ncontinue\nexpressions.extend([\nexp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\nif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n])\nand things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.\n</issue>"

Its logic includes incorporating fields from the model if necessary, respecting any `.values()` calls that influence the GROUP BY clause, and adapting based on any filters, annotations, or orderings applied to the queryset.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**: The bug manifests when the `order_by('?')` is used in a queryset that also uses an aggregate function (`Count` in this case). According to the issue description, using `order_by('?')` unexpectedly affects the aggregation by breaking it down incorrectly. This is likely related to how `get_group_by` handles non-reference, non-aggregate expressions in the `order_by` part of a query, and might not properly exclude the `RANDOM()` function from altering the GROUP BY logic.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the presence of `RANDOM()` in the ordering (which is purely for generating a random order and not relevant to the logical grouping of the data) should not alter the outcome of the aggregation. The aggregation should reflect the actual counts without being divided by the random ordering, meaning `get_group_by` should maintain the original grouping as if the `order_by('?')` were not present.\n\n### Analysis of `Random`\n\n1. **What it does**: The `Random` class is a subclass of `Func` that represents the SQL `RANDOM()` function. This function generates a new random value for each row in the result set. It's a no-argument function (`arity = 0`) that is compatible with different database backends (custom implementations for MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite are mentioned).\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**: The issue arises from including the `Random` function in the ORDER BY clause, which, due to its nondeterministic nature, shouldn't influence the logical grouping of database rows for the purposes of aggregation. However, the presence of this function causes the `get_group_by` logic to mistakenly include it in determining the GROUP BY clause, thereby affecting the aggregation result.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The `Random` function should be recognized as a special case in ordering that does not contribute to the logic of data grouping in aggregations. Its use for ordering should not alter the behavior of aggregation functions like `Count`. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven this analysis, the solution requires modifying the `get_group_by` method to ensure it doesn't let the presence of `Random` in `order_by` clauses disrupt the normal logic of aggregations. This involves adding a check to explicitly ignore `Random` and perhaps other similar non-aggregate, non-referencing expressions when assembling the GROUP BY clause."

This means within the loop that iterates over `order_by` expressions, a check should be implemented to skip over any expressions that are instances of the `Random` class. The existing functionality for handling other types of expressions in `order_by` and determining when to group by select fields or specific expressions should remain unchanged. The goal is to make sure the use of `order_by('?')` does not disrupt the aggregation logic, specifically maintaining the correct grouping for aggregations like `Count`, while still allowing for random ordering of the final result set without contributing to the group by clause logic."
