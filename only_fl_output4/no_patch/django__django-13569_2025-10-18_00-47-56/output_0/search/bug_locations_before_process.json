        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `get_group_by` method to ensure that when determining the expressions to include in the GROUP BY clause, expressions that generate random ordering (`Random`) do not influence the logic used to aggregate rows. This means within the loop that iterates over `order_by` expressions, a check should be implemented to skip over any expressions that are instances of the `Random` class. The existing functionality for handling other types of expressions in `order_by` and determining when to group by select fields or specific expressions should remain unchanged. The goal is to make sure the use of `order_by('?')` does not disrupt the aggregation logic, specifically maintaining the correct grouping for aggregations like `Count`, while still allowing for random ordering of the final result set without contributing to the group by clause logic."
