This function will wrap `numpy.cross` using `xr.apply_ufunc`, handling the computation of the cross product between two `DataArray` objects. This function needs to manage dimensions correctly, ensuring that the operation applies over the expected dimensions and respects `xarray`'s labeled data principles. The implementation should follow the pattern used by `dot`, adjusting for the particulars of cross product computation (e.g., it should check for the presence of three-component vectors as inputs and correctly align input dimensions)."

This method will utilize the `cross` function defined in `computation.py` and should follow the signature pattern of the `dot` method to maintain consistency. It should accept another `DataArray` and a dimension name (or names) over which to perform the cross product, along with any other parameters necessary to control the computation (e.g., a parameter to specify the output data type)."
