Given the information provided and the nature of the issue, which seems to be focused on integrating a vector cross product feature similar to `numpy.cross` into `xarray`, along with an error encountered during this process, we'll create a reproducible example that aligns with the initial request but also addresses the encountered error. Assume the main issue is to verify if integrating a cross product feature into `xarray` would work correctly and raise an error if it doesn't function as expected.

The provided test execution error highlights an issue with the use of `np.unicode_` in the environment having NumPy 2.0 where this attribute is no longer available, showing a compatibility issue rather than a specific functionality error with the cross product implementation. However, for the purpose of this request, we'll focus on the cross product functionality aspect as described initially.

Let's create a `reproducer.py` that attempts to use a cross product function similar to the one you provided and checks for the successful integration and use within `xarray`, while also gracefully addressing or highlighting potential incompatibilities with recent NumPy versions:

```python
# reproducer.py

import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import numpy as np
    import xarray as xr

    def cross(a, b, spatial_dim, output_dtype=None):
        for d in (a, b):
            if spatial_dim not in d.dims:
                raise ValueError(f'dimension {spatial_dim} not in {d}')
            if d.sizes[spatial_dim] != 3:
                raise ValueError(f'dimension {spatial_dim} has not length 3 in {d}')
            
        if output_dtype is None: 
            output_dtype = a.dtype
        c = xr.apply_ufunc(np.cross, a, b,
                           input_core_dims=[[spatial_dim], [spatial_dim]],
                           output_core_dims=[[spatial_dim]],
                           dask='parallelized', output_dtypes=[output_dtype])
        return c

    # Test the function with a simple example
    a = xr.DataArray(np.empty((10, 3)), dims=['line', 'cartesian'])
    b = xr.full_like(a, 1)
    c = cross(a, b, 'cartesian')

    assert isinstance(c, xr.DataArray), "Result of `cross` is not an xarray.DataArray"

    print("Functionality test passed successfully.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code

sys.exit(0)  # Exit successfully if no error
```

This script aims to validate the functionality of a cross product operation within the xarray framework and will raise an `AssertionError` if the result does not meet expectations or print a stack trace for any other exceptions encountered during the execution, such as the one mentioned with `np.unicode_`. The script exits with code 0 if the operation is successful, indicating that the issue is fixed or not present.
