    Callable[[Path, FileContents, ScaffoldOpts], Union[Path, None]]

- **path** (:obj:`pathlib.Path`): file path potentially to be written to/changed
  in the disk.
- **contents** (:obj:`FileContents`): usually a string that represents a text content
  of the file. :obj:`None` indicates the file should not be written.
- **opts** (:obj:`ScaffoldOpts`): a dict with PyScaffold's options.

If the file is written (or more generally changed, such as new access permissions),
by convention they should return the :obj:`file path <pathlib.Path>`.
If no file was touched, :obj:`None` should be returned. Please notice a **FileOp**
might return :obj:`None` if a pre-existing file in the disk is not modified.

.. note::
    A **FileOp** usually has side effects (e.g. write a file to the disk), see
    :obj:`FileFileContents` and :obj:`ScaffoldOpts` for other conventions.
