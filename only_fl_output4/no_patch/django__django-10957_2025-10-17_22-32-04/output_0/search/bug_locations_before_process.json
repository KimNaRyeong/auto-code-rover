        "intended_behavior": "Each of these functions (`ugettext`, `ugettext_lazy`, `ugettext_noop`, `ungettext`, and `ungettext_lazy`) should be marked as deprecated explicitly within their defining modules if not already. This would typically involve wrapping them with Django's deprecation utilities, which provide a warning to developers that these functions will be removed in upcoming versions. Documentation within the Django project should be updated to refer developers to the preferred functions (`gettext`, `gettext_lazy`, etc.). Ensure that any direct or indirect references to these deprecated functions within Django's own codebase are replaced with the recommended alternatives. Consideration for how these deprecations affect third-party apps and modules relying on Django's translation features would be necessary, likely requiring a clear communication strategy and migration path outlined in Django's release notes or documentation."
