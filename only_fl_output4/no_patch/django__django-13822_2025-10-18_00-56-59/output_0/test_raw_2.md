Given the details surrounding your request and the previous attempt, I'll provide a corrected approach to reproduce the issue described, keeping in mind the limitations encountered. This attempt focuses on creating a more self-contained script that doesn't rely on nonexistent Django applications (`app1` and `app2`) but rather creates the models dynamically and simulates the situation where the issue might occur.

This script will dynamically create Django models and simulate an environment where the creation of migrations could cause a `fields.E305` error related to `ManyToManyFields` with `related_name='+'`. However, due to the way Django dynamically processes models and migrations, some aspects of this behavior might be tricky to replicate exactly as described without a full Django application context. Nonetheless, this revised script aims to closely emulate the conditions that could lead to the error.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

            },
        },
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

    django.setup()

    from django.db import models

    class TargetModel(models.Model):

            app_label = 'test_app'

    class SourceModel(models.Model):
        related = models.ManyToManyField(TargetModel, related_name='+')

        class Meta:

    return TargetModel, SourceModel

        setup_django_environment()

            ProjectState(),  # Before state.
            ProjectState.from_apps(apps),  # After state.
        )

        changes = detector.changes(graph=apps.migrations_graph)
        if changes:
            print("Detected changes, this indicates no issues so far.")
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Expected to detect changes, none found.")

    except FieldError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Detected Django Field related error.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:

        sys.exit(0)

Place this script in the root directory of a Django project to execute. This updated script attempts to incorporate a more sophisticated handling by simulating the Django project environment, dynamically creating models that could exhibit the problematic behavior, and analyzing migration changes. Given the complexity of Django's model and migration internals, ensure Django is properly installed and available in your environment before executing the script.
