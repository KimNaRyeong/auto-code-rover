        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue mentioned, we need to understand how the `ManyToManyField` is used in models across different apps and specifically check the implementation around `related_name='+'` or similar usage. Since the issue involves models in different apps with the same name having a `ManyToManyField` pointing to the same model, it would be beneficial to look at:\n\n1. How models are defined, concentrating on those with `ManyToManyFields`.\n2. The usage of `related_name` attribute in `ManyToManyFields`.\n3. The migration files or functions that might be causing issues when models in different apps have the same name but are linked via `ManyToManyFields`.\n\nHowever, without specific filenames or class names, I'll start with a general approach to understand the structure and specific constructs related to `ManyToManyField` usage.\n\n1. **Searching for Models with ManyToManyFields**\n   \n   Since models in Django often reside in `models.py` within each app directory, we should search for usage of `ManyToManyField` to get an understanding of how they are implemented across various models.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Searching for Migrations Workflow**\n   \n   Django creates migrations based on the state of models. We need to see if there's custom migration logic or if a specific part of the Django migration system is being invoked that doesn't handle this case well.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"CreateModel\")\n   search_code(\"AddField\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Specific Usage of `related_name='+'`**\n   \n   The issue mentions that having `related_name='+'` does not impact the error. It might be useful to understand its usage pattern in the context of `ManyToManyField`.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField(related_name='+')\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Looking for Manual Specifications of related_name**\n   \n   Given that specifying a `related_name` is mentioned as a workaround, it would be helpful to look at examples of this to understand the current workarounds being employed.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField(related_name=\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to identify patterns or implementation details that could lead to the described issue, providing a basis for understanding how `ManyToManyFields` are used in the context of models with identical names across different apps."
