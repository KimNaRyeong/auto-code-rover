Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

It wraps around the `open_dataset` method, differing by loading the dataset into memory and closing the file, while `open_dataset` keeps the file handle open for lazy loading.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  Given the issue's focus on enhancing the flexibility of specifying custom backends through the `engine` parameter, it's likely that the handling for this parameter is detailed in or around the `open_dataset` method, which `load_dataset` calls. The issue suggests modifying how `engine` is interpreted to allow passing functions directly, which means the `open_dataset` method could be the key area for implementing the requested feature.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior, based on the issue, would involve modifying the `load_dataset` or more specifically the `open_dataset` method such that it can accept a function as an argument for the `engine` parameter, bypassing the current string-based backend selection mechanism.\n\nGiven the results and analysis, it's clear that further investigation into how the `open_dataset` function handles its parameters, especially the `engine` parameter, is needed. Since the search for \"engine parameter\" and \"plugin registration\" did not yield direct results, a more targeted approach to examining the `open_dataset` function and possibly how backends are registered is necessary.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the focus should be on the point where `engine` parameter handling occurs and how backends are registered or dynamically recognized, the following concrete steps need to be taken:\n\n1. Investigate the `open_dataset` function, which is called by `load_dataset` and is likely responsible for processing the `engine` parameter.\n\n2. Given the lack of results for \"engine parameter\" and \"plugin registration\", more specific search terms or broadening the search criteria might be necessary. Understanding how backends are dynamically loaded or registered within xarray could be crucial. This might involve looking for backend-related code snippets or exploring how xarray integrates with external plugins more broadly.\n\nAppropriate API calls for these next steps could include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"open_dataset\", \"xarray/backends/api.py\")`: This aims to directly investigate how `open_dataset` handles its parameters, specifically looking for any `engine` parameter logic.\n- `search_code(\"backend registration\")`: Since the direct search for \"plugin registration\" was not fruitful, adjusting the search term might uncover the relevant parts of the codebase dealing with backend or plugin registration."

Currently, it appears to accept strings that map to pre-defined backends. The intended behavior would involve allowing a function object to be passed as an argument for the `engine` parameter. This function object would then be used directly as the backend for reading data, bypassing the existing string-based selection mechanism. This modification must preserve the current functionality for users who continue to pass a string identifier for the backend. The change would add an if-else branch early in the method to check if the engine parameter is a callable (i.e., a function) and, if so, use it directly to load the dataset. For all other cases, the existing logic for selecting and using a backend based on a string identifier should remain unchanged."
