        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be updated to allow passing a function directly via the 'engine' parameter. The modification involves checking if the 'engine' is a callable function at the beginning of this method. If it is a callable, this should override the default engine selection process and use the provided function directly to open the dataset. Specifically, this could be implemented around the existing engine check logic (currently at line 492-493 where 'engine' is set based on 'plugins.guess_engine(filename_or_obj)' if not provided), adding a condition to check if 'engine' is a callable. If so, bypass the 'plugins.get_backend(engine)' (at line 495) and instead use the engine function directly. The rest of the function, including handling of parameters like 'chunks', 'cache', and decoding options, should remain unaffected to ensure that the overall functionality for users specifying engines as strings remains unchanged."
