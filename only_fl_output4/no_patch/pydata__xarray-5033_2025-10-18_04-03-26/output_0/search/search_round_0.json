Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue involves simplifying the addition of custom backends in xarray, specifically through the `engine` parameter in a function likely used for loading datasets, I will need to gather more context around the relevant parts of the codebase. Key items to search for include the location and implementation details of the `load_dataset` function, understanding how the `engine` parameter is currently handled, and any existing mechanism for plugin registration or backend function selection.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to get the information needed to address this issue:\n\n1. Search for the `load_dataset` method across the entire codebase to find its definition and usage, which will give us insights into the function's implementation and parameters.\n   \n2. Search for code snippets related to handling the `engine` parameter, which is said to involve a bunch of string checks. Investigating these checks will help identify where and how to potentially allow function objects as values for `engine`.\n\n3. Search for code snippets or method calls involving plugin registration or external plugin references in `setup.py`, as mentioned in the issue. This will help understand the current plugin architecture.\n\nThese actions will provide a sufficient starting point for understanding how xarray handles backend engines and how it might be adapted:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_dataset\")`\n- `search_code(\"engine parameter\")`\n- `search_code(\"plugin registration\")`"
