        "content": "Given the issue description, the bug revolves around the handling of files with the same name but different extensions in Sphinx, particularly when an extension (like myst-parser for Markdown) is involved. The bug specifically occurs when Sphinx is expected to parse a `.md` file, but instead picks the `.rst` file with the same base name.\n\nTo gather the necessary code context for resolving this bug, we need to find how Sphinx decides which file to include when multiple files with the same base name but different extensions exist. Since this behavior likely involves the parsing or the building process where Sphinx decides which files to include in the documentation, we should focus on parts of the code that deal with file selection, parsing directives (like `.. toctree::`), and possibly Sphinx's configuration mechanisms, as a solution might involve adding a configuration option or modifying existing logic to address file extension preferences or warnings.\n\nLet's start by focusing on the following areas:\n\n1. **TocTree Directive Processing**: Since the issue mentions the `.. toctree::` directive incorrectly including `a.rst` instead of `a.md`, starting with the part of the code handling `.. toctree::` directive would be logical.\n\n2. **Configuration Loading and Parsing**: The feature request suggests a possible solution could be a configuration option that specifies the order of preference for file extensions. Looking at how Sphinx handles configuration settings might give insight into where such an option could be integrated.\n\n3. **File Selection and Parsing Logic**: Since the bug involves file selection (`.md` vs `.rst`), identifying the logic that determines which files get parsed and included based on extensions is critical.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls I would make to gather necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"TocTree\")`: To find the directive processing involved with `.. toctree::`. This might return methods or classes involved in parsing or handling table of contents trees.\n- `search_code(\".. toctree::\")`: To directly find instances where the `.. toctree::` directive is handled or mentioned in the code, giving us more context on its processing.\n- `search_method(\"config\")`: To get an overview of how configuration is processed within Sphinx, which might help in adding a new configuration option.\n- `search_code(\"extension\")`: Since the issue involves file extensions, this search might reveal where Sphinx deals with file extensions specifically or how it selects files for parsing.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding how Sphinx currently handles file inclusion with respect to extensions and where modifications might need to be made to address this issue."
