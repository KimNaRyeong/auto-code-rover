This could be implemented either by enhancing existing methods or introducing a new method to filter and sort files based on a configurable priority list before including them in the build process. This priority list could be configured through the existing Sphinx configuration mechanisms, allowing users to specify their preference for `.md` over `.rst` or vice versa. It's essential that this change does not disrupt the current functionality for projects not requiring this feature."

An update here should introduce a new configuration option, e.g., `file_extension_priority`, which allows users to specify an ordered list of file extensions according to their priorities. This new configuration option should be documented and have default behavior that preserves the current functionality (e.g., an empty list or a list favoring Sphinx's default file extension handling), ensuring backward compatibility."
