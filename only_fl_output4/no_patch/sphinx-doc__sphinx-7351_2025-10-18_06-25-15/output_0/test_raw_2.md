Given the complexities of running Sphinx and its dependency on specific project and environment configurations, creating a standalone script that reproduces the issue directly by invoking Sphinx could be challenging without ensuring the environment setup (`sphinx-build` and required extensions) is correct and operational. However, I'll provide an updated approach that includes checks for the environment and attempts to capture and handle potential errors more gracefully, particularly focusing on Sphinx's execution and output analysis.

This revised `reproducer.py` will:

1. Create a minimal Sphinx project with `index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst`.
2. Attempt to run `sphinx-build`.
3. Check if the output contains content from `a.md`, assuming a correct setup and operational Sphinx.
4. Catch exceptions during Sphinx invocation, including issues related to the environment or missing dependencies.
5. Use the previously provided function to print detailed stack traces.

**Note:** This script still requires a working Sphinx environment and may need adjustments based on the specific Sphinx version and extensions installed.

import shutil
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

**Important Reminders:**

- Before executing this script, ensure that Sphinx and the `myst_parser` extension are correctly installed and configured in your environment.
- The script may still fail if there are environment-specific issues or if Sphinx and its dependencies are not correctly set up.
- Adjustments might be necessary depending on the version of Sphinx and `myst_parser` used, as well as other project-specific configurations.
