        "content": "Creating a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` to automatically trigger and evaluate the Sphinx issue described requires a set-up where the Sphinx project context is simulated. This implies creating necessary files on-the-fly, running Sphinx, and checking the output to identify the presence of the issue. Notably, the script would need to:\n\n1. Create a temporary Sphinx project with the required files (`index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst`).\n2. Run a Sphinx build process on this temporary project.\n3. Inspect the generated documentation to determine whether `a.md` or `a.rst` was included, contrary to the expectations set in `index.rst`.\n\nHere's an attempt to craft such a script. Note, however, that Python's built-in capabilities might be insufficient for some Sphinx internal operations, such as evaluating the build's output content directly. This script therefore focuses on preparing the environment, invoking the Sphinx build, and providing guidelines for manually checking the inconsistency, alongside a template for automated checks where feasible.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport shutil\nfrom tempfile import TemporaryDirectory\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef create_sphinx_project(temp_dir):\n    index_content = \"\"\"\n.. toctree::\n   a.md\n\"\"\"\n    a_md_content = \"\"\"\n# Title in MD\n\nContent from MD file.\n\"\"\"\n    a_rst_content = \"\"\"\nTitle in RST\n============\n\nContent from RST file.\n\"\"\"\n\n    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:\n        f.write(index_content)\n    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, 'a.md'), 'w') as f:\n        f.write(a_md_content)\n    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, 'a.rst'), 'w') as f:\n        f.write(a_rst_content)\n\n    # Assuming 'conf.py' is minimal for reproducing the issue.
