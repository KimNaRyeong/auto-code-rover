This change accounts for the fact that `SMTPException` is now a subclass of `OSError`, and `socket.error` is an alias for `OSError`. The method's functionality should remain unchanged, continuing to handle exceptions that occur during the establishment of an SMTP connection in a fail-silently or raise-error manner, depending on the configuration."

This keeps the error handling during email dispatching through SMTP intact, ensuring that connection and sending errors are appropriately managed without changing the external behavior of failing silently or raising errors based on configuration."
