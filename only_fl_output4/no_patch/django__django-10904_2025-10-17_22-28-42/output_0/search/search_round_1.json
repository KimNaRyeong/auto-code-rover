With this in mind, the Django code base can be cleaned up.\nFor additional details, see the Python 3.3 release notes:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-3151-reworking-the-os-and-io-exception-hierarchy\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between OSError, IOError, EnvironmentError, WindowsError, mmap.error, socket.error or select.error. All these exception types are now only one: OSError. The other names are kept as aliases for compatibility reasons.\nAdditionally, since Python 3.4, SMTPException is subclass of OSError . So exception handles catching both can be simplified to just OSError.\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPException\nSubclass of OSError that is the base exception class for all the other exceptions provided by this module.\nChanged in version 3.4: SMTPException became subclass of OSError\n</issue>"

Given the Python 3.3+ updates, our goal is to replace these with OSError, simplifying exception handling. Furthermore, since SMTPException is a subclass of OSError from Python 3.4 onwards, we also aim to replace instances catching SMTPException along with any of the other specified exceptions, with just OSError.\n\nTo gather the sufficient code context for each type of exception mentioned in the issue, I will perform a series of search API calls targeting these exceptions explicitly.

        "content": "Let's analyze the gathered context based on the search results related to the usage of the exceptions that need to be replaced with `OSError` in the Django codebase. Our goal is to ensure that all instances of certain exceptions are appropriately updated to use `OSError` following Python 3.3+ recommendations, and we also need to consider SMTPException's relationship with OSError from Python 3.4 onwards.\n\n### 1. `IOError` Usages\nThe search results show that `IOError` is still being used in several files throughout the Django project. These instances range from middleware and HTTP handling to file and session management. Given the issue at hand, these usages of `IOError` are all candidates for replacement with `OSError`. Since Python has consolidated the exception hierarchy as of version 3.3, changing these references to `OSError` would both simplify the codebase and bring it up to date with current Python standards.\n\n### 2. `EnvironmentError` Usages\nThe presence of `EnvironmentError` in settings related to GIS (`libgeos.py` and `libgdal.py`) indicates exception handling around configuration and library loading operations. With `EnvironmentError` being an alias for `OSError`, replacing it would have no functional impact but would clarify that these blocks are handling operating system level errors, which include, but are not limited to, issues with accessing or loading libraries.\n\n### 3. `WindowsError` and `mmap.error`\nNo instances were found of `WindowsError` or `mmap.error`, which may indicate either these exceptions were not used or potentially could be caught as `OSError` already due to previous refactorings or due to their rarity in the code base's concerned pathways.\n\n### 4. `socket.error` Usages\nInstances found in server management and email backend suggest handling of low-level socket operation errors, which are directly related to network communications. As these are now covered under `OSError`, the code alteration will unify error handling across these functionalities, reducing the need for specialized handling unless specifically required by the logic.\n\n### 5. `select.error` \nNo findings indicate that either `select.error` was not used or it has been correctly captured under `OSError` in the current code paths.\n\n### 6. `SMTPException` Usages\nWith `SMTPException` now a subclass of `OSError`, the specific catches in the email backend can be simplified. Currently, catching both `SMTPException` and `socket.error` separately, as shown in `EmailBackend.open`, complicates the logic with a redundancy that can be streamlined into a single `except OSError` block. This simplification will still correctly handle email-related exceptions due to network issues or SMTP protocol errors without changing the application's behavior.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven the analysis, the next step involves creating patches to replace the usages of these exceptions with `OSError` and simplifying the catch blocks that include both `SMTPException` and a now-unnecessary specific exception type.\n\nFor each category of exceptions found, we should review the surrounding code to ensure that replacing these exceptions with `OSError` does not alter the intended behavior of the exception handling logic. The challenge will be in ensuring that the more general `OSError` does not catch more exceptions than intended, especially in areas where specific exceptions were used to handle very particular error conditions.\n\nTo proceed effectively, we need to draft changes for the mentioned files, paying close attention to maintaining the current logic and exception handling specificity where required, and otherwise simplifying it in accordance with Python's streamlined exception hierarchy."

This change accounts for the fact that `SMTPException` is now a subclass of `OSError`, and `socket.error` is an alias for `OSError`. The method's functionality should remain unchanged, continuing to handle exceptions that occur during the establishment of an SMTP connection in a fail-silently or raise-error manner, depending on the configuration.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - File: django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py\n     - Class: EmailBackend\n     - Method: close\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Simplify the `except smtplib.SMTPException:` block to `except OSError:`. This modification maintains the method's purpose, which is to close the SMTP connection gracefully, handling any exceptions that may arise during the closure without altering the response in case of errors, based on the `fail_silently` attribute.\n\n   - **Location 3:**\n     - File: django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py\n     - Class: EmailBackend\n     - Method: _send\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Update the exception handling from `except smtplib.SMTPException:` to `except OSError:`. This keeps the error handling during email dispatching through SMTP intact, ensuring that connection and sending errors are appropriately managed without changing the external behavior of failing silently or raising errors based on configuration.\n\nThese modifications across the `EmailBackend` class methods in smtp.py will streamline exception handling related to email sending functionalities, aligning with the current Python standards post-3.3/3.4 updates, and reducing the need for handling specific exception subclasses that now fall under the broad `OSError` umbrella."
