        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new method `drop_isel` within the `Dataset` class, leveraging the logical framework of the existing `drop_sel` method but applying it to integer-based index selection as is done with the `isel` method. This method should allow users to drop data by specifying integer indices directly, handling dimensions without coordinate labels efficiently. It must iterate over each dimension specified by the user, identify the indices to be dropped, and then exclude them from the dataset. The method should also gracefully handle edge cases, such as when specified indices are out of bounds or dimensions do not exist, with behavior mirroring the error handling found in `drop_sel` (i.e., controlled by an `errors` parameter that can be set to 'raise' or 'ignore'). Preserve existing functionality by ensuring that this new method does not interfere with or alter the behavior of existing methods, particularly `isel`, `sel`, and `drop_sel`. Update the Dataset documentation to include this new method, clearly explaining its use case, parameters, and examples illustrating dropping data without coordinate labels."
