Please describe.**\nI am trying to drop particular indices from a dimension that doesn't have coordinates.\nFollowing: [drop_sel() documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.drop_sel.html#xarray.Dataset.drop_sel),\nbut leaving out the coordinate labels:\n```python\ndata = np.random.randn(2, 3)\nds = xr.Dataset({\"A\": ([\"x\", \"y\"], data)})\nds.drop_sel(y=[1])\n```\ngives me an error.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would think `drop_isel` should exist and work in analogy to `drop_sel` as `isel` does to `sel`.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAs far as I know, I could either create coordinates especially to in order to drop, or rebuild a new dataset. Both are not congenial. (I'd be grateful to know if there is actually a straightforward way to do this I've overlooked.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather more context regarding the relevant methods and classes in the codebase. The issue mentions the `drop_sel` method and a proposed `drop_isel` functionality that does not currently exist. The `Dataset` object is a central element of the discussion. Here's how we can proceed using the provided search APIs:\n\n1. Search for the `Dataset` class to understand its structure and existing methods.\n2. Inspect the `drop_sel` method within the `Dataset` class since the issue revolves around an analogous function to this.\n3. Look for any occurrence of `isel` within the `Dataset` class to understand how index-based selection is currently implemented.\n4. Search the entire codebase for `drop_isel` to see if there's any preliminary, possibly incomplete or unmerged, work on such a functionality.\n\nGiven these points, I'd like to invoke the following API calls:\n\n- search_class(\"Dataset\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"drop_sel\", \"Dataset\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"isel\", \"Dataset\")\n- search_method(\"drop_isel\")"
