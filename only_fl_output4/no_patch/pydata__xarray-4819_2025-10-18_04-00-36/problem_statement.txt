drop_sel indices in dimension that doesn't have coordinates?

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I am trying to drop particular indices from a dimension that doesn't have coordinates.

Following: [drop_sel() documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.drop_sel.html#xarray.Dataset.drop_sel),
but leaving out the coordinate labels:
```python
data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})
ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
```
gives me an error.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would think `drop_isel` should exist and work in analogy to `drop_sel` as `isel` does to `sel`.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

As far as I know, I could either create coordinates especially to in order to drop, or rebuild a new dataset. Both are not congenial. (I'd be grateful to know if there is actually a straightforward way to do this I've overlooked.
