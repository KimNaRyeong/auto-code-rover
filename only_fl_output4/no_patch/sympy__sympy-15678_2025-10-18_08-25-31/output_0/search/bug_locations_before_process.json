        "intended_behavior": "The `idiff` function should be enhanced to check if the input equation `eq` is an instance of `Eq`. If so, it should extract the left and right sides of the equation and form a subtractive expression `(lhs - rhs)` to use in place of `eq`. This should be done before performing substitutions and differentiations, right at the start of the function. This adjustment allows the `idiff` function to handle `Eq` objects transparently without requiring pre-processing by the user.\n\nWhen a function (e.g., `f(x)`) is passed as the dependent variable `y`, instead of raising a `ValueError`, `idiff` should properly recognize and process this form. This involves identifying function objects and treating them similarly to symbols but with an additional step of differentiation that respects the function's variable (e.g., `x`). A verification step should ensure that the function's variable matches the independent variable of differentiation `x`. This fix should include preparing the `f(x)` correctly in the `f` dictionary construction (around the current line 576) and ensuring that the differential operations that follow handle function types appropriately."
