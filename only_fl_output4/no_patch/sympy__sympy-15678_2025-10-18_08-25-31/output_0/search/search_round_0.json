        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the issue, we can perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a function `idiff` and includes traceback paths related to `sympy/geometry/util.py`, it's crucial to find this function and examine its implementation. Therefore, a search for this method in the specific file is needed to understand its current handling of `Eq` and function notation:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\n2. Given the mention of errors when passing an equation in the form of `Eq` and using function notation `f(x)`, it would be helpful to understand how these are handled within the `idiff` method. Since these aren't direct method or class names, looking for their usage or handling logic within `idiff` through code snippets search in the specific file can provide insight:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"ValueError(\\\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got:\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\n3. The `idiff` function might be part of a larger class or module that deals with symbolic differentiation or equation manipulation in general. Understanding its context can be useful, so searching for the class or module where `idiff` resides would be informative:\n   - `search_code(\"def idiff(\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at understanding the specific implementation issues with `idiff` related to handling `Eq` and recognizing `f(x)` as a valid argument. The results will provide the necessary information to consider adjustments or enhancements."
