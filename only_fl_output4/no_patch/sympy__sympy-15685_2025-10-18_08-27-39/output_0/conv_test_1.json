In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\r\n\r\n### What I Did\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\r\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\r\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\r\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\r\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\r\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\r\nohm/1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Further discussion\r\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\r\n```\r\n>>> vs.scale_factor\r\n1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\r\n\r\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\r\n\r\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\r\n```\r\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\r\n1000\r\n\r\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n"
