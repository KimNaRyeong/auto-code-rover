Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that follows the instructions provided. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if it encounters the described issue regarding the unexpected `scale_factor` and the incorrect result when dividing a quantity of voltage by a quantity of current. Remember to have Sympy version 1.3 installed in your environment when testing this:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to
    
    vs = Quantity('vs')
    vs.set_dimension(voltage)
    vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')
    vs_i.set_dimension(current)
    
    # Expected: vs/vs_i should yield ohm, not ohm/1000
    try:
        result = convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)
        # Checking if result matches the expected ohm (considering the potential scale factor error)
        assert str(result) == 'ohm', "Expected result to be 'ohm'"
        return True
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if check_issue():
        print("Issue resolved or not present.")
    else:
        print("Issue reproduced.")
```

This script does the following:
- Defines a function to print stack traces of exceptions for clear diagnostics.
- Implements a function `check_issue()` that:
  - Imports necessary classes and functions from `sympy.physics.units`.
  - Initializes two `Quantity` instances for voltage and current, respectively.
  - Attempts to divide these quantities and convert the result to ohms, checking if the result matches the expected behavior for the SI system.
  - Uses an `assert` statement to confirm the result is as expected (`ohm`), and if not, it triggers an AssertionError that is caught and displayed using `print_stacktrace()`.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block executes the `check_issue()` function and prints feedback based on whether the issue is present.

Run this script in your environment setup with the appropriate versions mentioned in the issue to reproduce the behavior described.
