To accurately replicate the issue as described, assuming a Python environment where switching between matplotlib backends would typically be possible, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` to follow your instructions. This script now more explicitly addresses the switch between matplotlib backends from `Qt5Agg` (or any GUI backend that is available) to `inline`, simulating the environment where such an issue gets triggered, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks or similar environments.

Since you are encountering limitations with GUI backends in a potentially 'headless' environment, the revised script will skip the backend availability check and directly attempt to change backends, following the presumed logic flow in environments where both backends are accessible.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys
from contextlib import contextmanager

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

@contextmanager
def window():
    try:
        # Attempting to set to a GUI backend
        matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg', force=True)
        yield
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        # Attempt to switch back to inline would go here
        # For the sake of this standalone reproducer, this illustrates the intended backend switch
        try:
            matplotlib.use('Agg', force=True)  # Assuming 'Agg' as a placeholder for 'inline' in non-interactive or headless environments
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

def test_plot():
    with window():
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot([1, 3, 2])
        plt.show(block=True)
    
    # Assume 'inline' is set. Now check if previous plot window is closed as a result of the backend switch.
    try:
        assert plt.get_fignums(), "Expected the Qt5Agg window to remain open, but it was closed."
        print("Success: The Qt5Agg plot window remained open as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_plot()
    sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the absence of unhandled exceptions
```
This script attempts to simulate the behavior of backend switching in a headless environment by using `matplotlib.use('Agg', force=True)` as a placeholder to mimic switching back to an `inline` backend after plotting with a GUI backend like `Qt5Agg`. The `Agg` backend is used here for demonstration since it does not require a GUI and thus serves as a stand-in for `inline` in non-interactive or script-based reproductions. 

However, it's critical to remember that this adapted script might not directly reproduce the GUI-closing behavior as experienced within a Jupyter Notebook environment, since it's designed to be executed outside such environments. This adaptation focuses on backend switching and error handling, reflecting on the issue's description rather than the specific mechanics within Jupyter.
