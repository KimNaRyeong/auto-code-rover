They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to understand how requests handle exceptions, specifically those originating from urllib3, and whether there is a mechanism in place for wrapping these exceptions with requests' own exception types. Here are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the requests exceptions module or class**: This will help us understand how requests define and handle its own exceptions. We might find a centralized place where external exceptions are caught and wrapped.\n   - `search_class(\"RequestException\")`: Since `RequestException` is the base class for all Requests' exceptions, finding it could lead us to the exception handling mechanism.\n   \n2. **Search for where requests interfaces with urllib3**: This can highlight where requests could potentially wrap urllib3 exceptions.\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions\")`: This will show us where in the code `requests` is directly referencing `urllib3` exceptions, which is likely where the wrapping would occur if it happens.\n   \n3. **Find specific instances of urllib3 exceptions being handled or not handled by requests**:\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError\")`\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError\")`\n\nThese searches will give us a good starting point to understand the current mechanism of exception handling between `requests` and `urllib3`, and how we might need to modify it to ensure urllib3 exceptions are properly wrapped by requests' exceptions."
