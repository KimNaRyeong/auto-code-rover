Certainly! Based on your requirements, here's a `reproducer.py` designed to fit within a Django project structure, reproducing an issue and making use of the provided function `print_stacktrace` for clarity in reporting errors. Please ensure your Django environment is properly set up (including necessary `INSTALLED_APPS`, `DATABASES`, and other settings in your `settings.py`) before running this script.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

def setup_django_environment():
    # Minimal Django settings required for running this script
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',  # Using in-memory database for simplicity
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),  # Current script will be considered as an app
        SECRET_KEY='dummy',
    )
    django.setup()

    class Foo(models.Model):
        a = models.CharField(max_length=10)
        d = models.IntegerField()

    class Bar(models.Model):
        a = models.ForeignKey(Foo, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        b = models.CharField(max_length=10)

    return Foo, Bar

def run_test(Foo, Bar):
    try:
        # Creating instances of Foo and Bar to demonstrate the ForeignKey issue
        foo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)
        foo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)
        bar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')

        import copy
        bar2 = copy.copy(bar1)
        bar2.pk = None
        bar2.a = foo2

        # Assertions as described in the original issue description
        if not (bar2.a == foo2 and bar2.a.id == bar2.a_id):
            raise AssertionError("Copy of ForeignKey field doesn't behave as expected.")

        if not (bar1.a == foo1 and bar1.a.id == bar1.a_id):
            raise AssertionError("Original ForeignKey field changed unexpectedly.")

        print("Test passed: ForeignKey caching behavior works as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)  # Using os._exit() here to handle non-zero exit correctly

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Foo, Bar = setup_django_environment()
    # Dynamically create the tables for our in-memory models
    args = ['reproducer.py', 'migrate']
    execute_from_command_line(args)
    run_test(Foo, Bar)
```

This script dynamically configures a minimal Django environment and defines two models, `Foo` and `Bar`, where `Bar` has a foreign key to `Foo`. It then tries to reproduce the caching behavior issue by copying an instance of `Bar` and modifying its foreign key reference.

Please note:

- This script uses an in-memory SQLite database (`':memory:'`) for simplicity. Adjust the `DATABASES` setting as needed for your environment.
- To run this script, save it in the root directory of a Django project and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. Ensure Django is installed in your environment.
- It uses a non-standard way to terminate the script with `os._exit(1)` to correctly report the non-zero exit status in case of an assertion failure. This may bypass some cleanup actions that Django or Python might otherwise perform on normal exit.
