It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

Particularly, we're interested in how ForeignKey fields behave in relation to model instance copying and caching in Django versions 1.11.x versus 2.x. The testcase provided in the issue gives us a clear entry point for our investigation.\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a change in behavior possibly introduced by a commit affecting ForeignKey (FK) field caching, it's critical to understand how FK fields are defined and used within models. Let's explore the model classes `Bar` and `Foo`.\n\n2. To understand the behavior of the model instance copy, specifically how `copy.copy()` interacts with Django model instances in the context of `ForeignKey` fields, we need to examine the internal handling of `_state` in Django models, as suggested in the description. This is because the copying mechanism seems to involve the copying of `_state`, which might now (in Django >= 2.0) include `fields_cache`.\n\n3. Testing and cloning strategies mentioned in the issue revolve around the `copy()` method and a need to possibly look into implementing a `Model.copy` method that ensures a deep-copy of `self._state`, considering the `fields_cache`.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n- **Explore `Bar` and `Foo` Models**: Since these are critical to understanding the issue, knowing their definitions will provide insight into how foreign keys are set up. It'll also offer clues to any overrides or custom methods that could influence cloning behavior.\n  ```python\n  search_class(\"Bar\")\n  search_class(\"Foo\")\n  ```\n\n- **Model `_state` Investigation**: To get more insight into how `_state` is managed within Django model instances, particularly its interaction with deep and shallow copying.\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"self._state\")\n  ```\n\n- **Deep Copy Mechanisms**: Considering that `deepcopy` is mentioned as a working solution in Django >=2.0, it would be beneficial to understand its interaction with model instances explicitly in relation to `_state` and `fields_cache`.\n  ```python\n  search_method(\"deepcopy\")\n  ```\n\nThese search queries should yield enough context to understand the problem fully and work towards a solution, considering the changes required to handle ForeignKey field caching between Django versions effectively."

        "content": "Given the results from our initial set of API calls, there are several observations and further steps we can consider to deepen our understanding of the issue:\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Models \"Bar\" and \"Foo\" Not Found**:\n   - The models `Bar` and `Foo` were not located in the code search. This could be because they are part of the hypothetical test suite specified in the issue description rather than the actual Django framework code. Their absence suggests we may focus more on Django's internal mechanisms, especially how model copying and the handling of `_state` may have changed between versions.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `self._state`**:\n   - The `self._state` attribute appears multiple times within `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/contrib/contenttypes/models.py`. This attribute is significant because it is likely associated with the internal state of a model instance, which includes tracking whether an instance is in the database, its original field values, and potentially cached relations.\n   - Since the issue suggests a behavior change related to how ForeignKey fields are cached (`fields_cache` as part of `self._state`), understanding the particulars of `self._state` management in `base.py` may provide insights into the nature of this change and its implications for instance copying.\n\n3. **Deepcopy Method Not Found**:\n   - Not finding a `deepcopy` method might indicate that Python's built-in `copy.deepcopy` function is used rather than a method explicitly defined within Django. Since `deepcopy` works according to the issue description, investigating how Django model instances interact with `copy.deepcopy` could illuminate the recommended approach for cloning model instances that include ForeignKey relations.\n\n### Questions and Further Actions\n\nReflecting on the observations and the bug's context, we should consider these questions:\n\n1. **How Does Django Manage Model Instance State?**\n   - Specifically, how does Django's implementation of `_state` and caching, including `fields_cache`, facilitate or hinder the correct copying of model instances with ForeignKey relations? Understanding this could answer whether the behavior in Django >= 2.0 is correct or needs adjustment.\n\n2. **ForeignKey Field Caching and Copying**:\n   - Considering the unexpected behavior change in FK field copying, is there something in the Django changelog or documentation around Django 2.0 that explicitly mentions changes in model copying or ForeignKey handling?\n\n### Next Steps Based on API Results\n\nTo move forward, we should:\n\n1. **Examine `self._state` in Detail**:\n   - Dive into specific uses and references of `self._state` within `base.py` to understand how Django models manage internal state and caching. This involves looking at how `fields_cache` is manipulated during model lifecycle events, including copying.\n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"self._state\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")\n     search_code_in_file(\"fields_cache\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Evaluate Model Copying Strategies**:\n   - Since the built-in `copy` module\u2019s `copy()` and `deepcopy()` functions are touched upon in the issue, investigating their interaction with Django model instances might provide insights. This can be tricky without a direct `deepcopy` method in the Django codebase, but understanding Django's recommendations or best practices for model copying post-Django 1.11.x could be valuable.\n     ```python\n     search_code(\"copy()\")\n     search_code(\"deepcopy()\")\n     ```\n   \n3. **Look for Documentation or Changelogs**:\n   - It may also be helpful to manually check Django's official documentation or changelogs around versions 2.0 and 2.2 for any mentioned changes in model cloning or ForeignKey handling, as this could provide immediate context and guidance on the observed behavior change and recommended practices moving forward."

The issue arises in the context of copying model instances with ForeignKey fields between Django versions, specifically from 1.11.x to 2.x, where the cached FK field in `fields_cache` results in unexpected behavior during shallow copy operations (`copy.copy()`). The bug is not in the existence of `_state` management or `fields_cache` itself but in how these are cloned or not properly reset when a model instance is copied.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The cloning (copying) operation should ensure that a deep copy of the model's `_state` is made, especially the `fields_cache` if present, to prevent unintended shared state between the original and the copied instance. Alternatively, if creating a deep copy of `_state` is not desired or feasible for performance reasons, a mechanism to reset or correctly update `fields_cache` in the copied object should be introduced, ensuring that changes to FK fields in the copied instance do not affect the original. Compatibility must be maintained with existing Django functionalities and expected behaviors for model instance copying. This might involve adjusting how `copy.copy()` interacts with Django model instances or providing clear documentation and recommendations for developers on how to handle deep copying of models especially concerning FK relations and cached fields."

The presence of `self._state` in these methods demonstrates its integral role in managing the internal state of model instances, tracking changes, and handling database operations.\n\n**Relation to the Bug**: The issue reported concerns the unexpected behavior when copying model instances with ForeignKey fields across Django versions, likely stemming from how `self._state` (and specifically `fields_cache` within it) is handled during such operations. The critical observation here is that any modification or cloning of model instances should consider how `self._state` and particularly `fields_cache` are copied or reset, preventing unintended side effects.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: In the context of this issue, the intended behavior would involve ensuring that when a model instance is copied (especially using `copy.copy()` as described in the test case), the `fields_cache` part of the model's `_state` is appropriately managed. This could mean either ensuring a deep copy of `fields_cache` is made or that `fields_cache` is reset/reinitialized in the new instance to prevent shared state issues.\n\n#### Regarding `fields_cache`:\n\nThe results show two key snippets related to `fields_cache`:\n1. The definition of a `ModelStateFieldsCacheDescriptor` class with a `__get__` method that initializes `instance.fields_cache` with an empty dictionary.\n2. The application of this descriptor within the model's class definition, indicating this caching mechanism is integral to model instance operations.\n\n**Relation to the Bug**: This directly impacts the bug because the reported issue involves unexpected behavior when copying model instances - behavior potentially rooted in how `fields_cache` is shared or not correctly reinitialized between the original and the copied instance.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The initialization of `fields_cache` as an empty dictionary when accessed via a model instance for the first time suggests a mechanism to ensure that each instance starts with a clean state for field caching. However, the unexpected behavior suggests that this mechanism may not work as intended in the context of copying instances. The intended behavior here would ensure that upon copying a model instance, the `fields_cache` is either also deeply copied or reset to ensure the copy does not unintentionally share state with the original.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these insights, a solution to the reported issue could involve modifying the handling of model instance copying to ensure that `fields_cache` is correctly managed\u2014either by enforcing a deep copy mechanism that includes this cache or by explicitly reinitializing `fields_cache` for the new instance, decoupling it from the original instance's state. This could potentially be implemented in or around the methods identified as interacting with `self._state`, ensuring that the copying behavior is consistent with expectations and preventing unintended sharing of cached ForeignKey references between instances."

When a model instance is copied via `copy.copy()`, the `fields_cache` should either be deeply copied to the new instance or reset entirely. This ensures that any modifications to ForeignKey fields in the copied instance do not affect the original instance, maintaining the integrity of the cached relationships.\n  \n  Implementing this could involve modifying the `__copy__` method of the model or introducing a new method specifically for copying instances that take into account the need to either deep copy or reset the `fields_cache`. The goal would be to preserve the existing functionality while ensuring that the copy does not inadvertently preserve links (through cached fields) to the original instance, which seems to be the unexpected behavior observed. This method should check if the instance has a `fields_cache` attribute and, if so, handle it correctly according to the intended deep copy or reset logic. \n\n  Additionally, considering the use of a descriptor for `fields_cache`, a careful approach must be taken to ensure that the descriptor's behavior aligns with the new copying logic, potentially by intercepting copies at the descriptor level to apply the necessary deep copy or reset logic.\n\nNo further context is needed at this point, as the issue and the path to a solution are now more clearly defined. The solution revolves around ensuring proper handling of `fields_cache` during the model copying process to avoid unexpected shared state between original and copied instances."
