        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the model's `_state`, especially the `fields_cache`, needs to be adjusted to ensure a correct copy mechanism. When a model instance is copied via `copy.copy()`, the `fields_cache` should either be deeply copied to the new instance or reset entirely. This ensures that any modifications to ForeignKey fields in the copied instance do not affect the original instance, maintaining the integrity of the cached relationships."
