It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's start with some strategic API calls to understand the structure and behavior of classes and methods mentioned in the issue description. Particularly, we're interested in how ForeignKey fields behave in relation to model instance copying and caching in Django versions 1.11.x versus 2.x. The testcase provided in the issue gives us a clear entry point for our investigation.\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a change in behavior possibly introduced by a commit affecting ForeignKey (FK) field caching, it's critical to understand how FK fields are defined and used within models. Let's explore the model classes `Bar` and `Foo`.\n\n2. To understand the behavior of the model instance copy, specifically how `copy.copy()` interacts with Django model instances in the context of `ForeignKey` fields, we need to examine the internal handling of `_state` in Django models, as suggested in the description. This is because the copying mechanism seems to involve the copying of `_state`, which might now (in Django >= 2.0) include `fields_cache`.\n\n3. Testing and cloning strategies mentioned in the issue revolve around the `copy()` method and a need to possibly look into implementing a `Model.copy` method that ensures a deep-copy of `self._state`, considering the `fields_cache`.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n- **Explore `Bar` and `Foo` Models**: Since these are critical to understanding the issue, knowing their definitions will provide insight into how foreign keys are set up. It'll also offer clues to any overrides or custom methods that could influence cloning behavior.\n  ```python\n  search_class(\"Bar\")\n  search_class(\"Foo\")\n  ```\n\n- **Model `_state` Investigation**: To get more insight into how `_state` is managed within Django model instances, particularly its interaction with deep and shallow copying.\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"self._state\")\n  ```\n\n- **Deep Copy Mechanisms**: Considering that `deepcopy` is mentioned as a working solution in Django >=2.0, it would be beneficial to understand its interaction with model instances explicitly in relation to `_state` and `fields_cache`.\n  ```python\n  search_method(\"deepcopy\")\n  ```\n\nThese search queries should yield enough context to understand the problem fully and work towards a solution, considering the changes required to handle ForeignKey field caching between Django versions effectively."
