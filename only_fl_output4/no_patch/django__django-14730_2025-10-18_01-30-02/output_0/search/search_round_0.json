However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n</issue>"

Given the nature of the issue, it's essential to understand the validation or initialization process of `ManyToManyField` where the `related_name` attribute is handled, especially in the context of symmetrical relationships.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make for gathering this context to address the issue:\n\n1. search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"add_field\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n3. search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n4. search_code(\"symmetrical\")\n\nThese calls aim to find the implementation of `ManyToManyField`, its initialization process, how fields are added (as the handling of `related_name` could be part of field addition or initialization), and any direct mentions or handling of `symmetrical` within the codebase."
