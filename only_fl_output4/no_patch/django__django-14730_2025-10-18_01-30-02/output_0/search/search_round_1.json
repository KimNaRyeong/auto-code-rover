        "content": "**Analysis of Collected Context**\n\nThe issue at hand deals with the `ManyToManyField` implementation in Django, specifically how it handles the `symmetrical` argument, and the current lack of error handling when a `related_name` is provided alongside `symmetrical=True` or in self-referential cases. Let\u2019s break down the information piece by piece based on the provided results:\n\n### `ManyToManyField` Class Definition in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `ManyToManyField` class is a subclass of `RelatedField`, used to define many-to-many relationships in Django models. It handles the creation and management of these relationships through various parameters like `to`, `related_name`, `through`, and importantly, `symmetrical`.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- This class is directly related to the bug since it outlines the initialization parameters and behaviors of a `ManyToManyField`. Notably, it accepts a `symmetrical` argument, which if `True`, does not create a related field on the target model for self-referential relationships.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- The intended behavior should include validations to raise an error when `related_name` is provided for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField` to prevent developers from assuming incorrectly that a related field would be created.\n\n### `__init__` Method of `ManyToManyField`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `__init__` method initializes a `ManyToManyField` instance, setting up various parameters that define the relationship. It confirms the `to` parameter represents a valid model and sets up the relationship characteristics, including whether it is symmetrical.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- This method's setup process, where `symmetrical` is determined (line 1180-1181) and where `related_name` is processed (as part of the `kwargs`), is a key part of where the issue\u2019s fix could be introduced.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- It should include a check after determining if the relationship is symmetrical to see if `related_name` is also provided and raise an error if both conditions are true.\n\n### Instances of `symmetrical` Usage in the Codebase\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The references to `symmetrical` within various files like `related.py`, `reverse_related.py`, and `related_descriptors.py` indicate how the symmetrical property is used throughout the Django model framework to handle or modify behavior based on whether a relationship is symmetrical.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- These references are crucial for understanding the extensive use and impact of the `symmetrical` property, suggesting that the handling of `symmetrical` is deeply integrated into how relationships are defined and interacted with.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- While not all instances may directly relate to the bug, any logic processing `related_name` in the context of `symmetrical` should ensure that it adheres to the intended validation behavior\u2014erroring out when `symmetrical` and `related_name` are used incompatibly.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on this analysis, introducing a validation check in the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyField` seems the most straightforward approach to fixing the bug. Before crafting a patch, however, reviewing related methods that interact with `symmetrical` and `related_name` could provide insight into whether additional adjustments are needed elsewhere, particularly in methods that might indirectly influence the initialization process, such as `contribute_to_class` or any method that directly handles relationship attributes."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Where are bug locations:\n\n#### Location 1:\n- **File:** `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n- **Class:** `ManyToManyField`\n- **Method:** `__init__`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** \nWithin the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyField` class, an additional check should be introduced after determining if the field is symmetrical (line 1181). This check should verify if `related_name` is provided (i.e., not `None`) when `symmetrical` is `True`. If both conditions are met, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that `related_name` cannot be used with a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`. This validation step will ensure that developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `related_name` in a symmetrical context, thereby avoiding confusion and potentially incorrect data modeling assumptions.\n\nThe code modification could resemble the following:\n\n```python\nif symmetrical and related_name is not None:\n    raise ValueError(\"related_name cannot be used with a symmetrical ManyToManyField.\")\n```\n\nThis check should ideally be placed right after the current validation logic for `symmetrical` and before or after the checks for the `through` and `db_table` parameters around lines 1181-1185. This ensures that the condition is validated early in the initialization process, preventing further processing with invalid parameters.\n\nAdditionally, this solution preserves the existing functionality of the code by not affecting any other parameter validation or behavior of the `ManyToManyField`. It specifically targets the issue at hand, ensuring a minimal impact on the overall functionality of the Django ORM."
