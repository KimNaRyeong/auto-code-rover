        "content": "To address the issue regarding the incorrect view name for CBVs (Class-Based Views) on the technical 404 debug page, we need to gather more context around how views are being identified and reported in the error pages, especially for CBVs. Given the regression commit mentioned, it is likely that the issue pertains to how the system handles the representation of class views in errors. The report indicates that instead of showing a clean class name `view_tests.views.Http404View`, the debug page shows `view_tests.views.<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`.\n\nBased on this information, we need to search for:\n- The representation of views, particularly focusing on how class-based views are handled.\n- The mechanism that generates the \"Raised by:\" information in the technical 404 debug page.\n\nTherefore, appropriate API calls to gather this context would include:\n\n1. Searching for the class `Http404View` to understand its structure and how it might be represented:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Http404View\")\n```\n\n2. Searching for the code that handles or manipulates the \"Raised by:\" output in error or debug pages, which likely involves string formatting or representation of classes. Given the lack of specific method names related to error handling or debug pages from the issue description, we will target broad code snippets related to \"Raised by:\" and error handling mechanisms:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Raised by:\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentioned a regression caused by a commit, looking at how CBVs are logged or how their strings are formatted for debug purposes could be useful. This requires understanding how Django or the project converts class references to strings, which might not be directly mentioned, but let's try to find if there is a generic handler for this:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_view_name\")\nsearch_code(\"str(class)\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed to cover the handling and representation of class-based views within the project\u2019s error reporting mechanism, focusing on areas that could contribute to the reported issue."
