This adjustment would enable users to specify the range within which floats are printed in fixed-point notation, preserving the existing functionality of the method while extending its capabilities."

This change would ensure that floats are printed consistently with user preferences on notation within LaTeX output. It's important that this implementation respects the existing LaTeX formatting rules, adding the ability for detailed control over float presentation without disrupting other latex settings."
