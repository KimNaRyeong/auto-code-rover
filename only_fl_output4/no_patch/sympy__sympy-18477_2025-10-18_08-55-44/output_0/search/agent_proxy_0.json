Given the issue description, here are the relevant API calls I will make:\n\n1. Search for the class that might be responsible for the mpmath printer to understand how `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings are implemented there. This could give insight into how these settings could be exposed to other printers.\n   - `search_class(\"MpmathPrinter\")`\n\n2. Search for the class or classes responsible for the LaTeX printer to identify differences in Float printing behavior compared to the string printer and how `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` could be integrated.\n   - `search_class(\"LatexPrinter\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions that only `strip_zeros` is exposed while `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` need to be, it would be useful to see where `strip_zeros` is implemented or used. This will help in figuring out where to similarly integrate the new options.\n   - `search_code(\"strip_zeros\")`\n\n4. Given the mention of unifying Float printing behavior across various printers, it could be helpful to find how Floats are currently being printed in the system. This might show how these printers are implemented or can be modified to include the new settings.\n   - `search_method(\"print_float\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and how it can be modified to include the requested features."
