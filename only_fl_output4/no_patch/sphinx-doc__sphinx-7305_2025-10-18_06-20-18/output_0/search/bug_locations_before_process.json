        "intended_behavior": "The `handle_signature` method needs to be enhanced to properly parse argument lists (`arglist`) that contain expressions, specifically those using the exponentiation operator `**` (for example, `a=2**4`). The enhancement should ensure that expressions within default argument values are correctly interpreted without leading to a `SyntaxError` or a `NotImplementedError` and thus without needing to fall back to the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` method. The code should be able to: - Correctly parse expressions in default values within argument lists. - Preserve the capability to handle situations that the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` was initially designed for, such as representing optional arguments, to ensure that existing functionality is not broken. - Log appropriate error or warning messages only when genuinely unexpected or unparseable syntax is encountered, not for syntactically valid Python expressions. This could potentially involve implementing a more robust algorithm or logic within `_parse_arglist` that can handle Python expressions or enhancing the error handling logic to better distinguish between actual syntax errors and complex yet valid expressions in default values."
