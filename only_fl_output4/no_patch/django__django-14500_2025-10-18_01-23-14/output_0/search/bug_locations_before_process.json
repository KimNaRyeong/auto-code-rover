        "intended_behavior": "This method should incorporate logic to carefully check and mark the squashed migration as unapplied when its replaced migrations are unapplied. Specifically, after the current logic that handles the replacement migrations (lines 253-258), there should be an additional check to see if a squashed migration exists that contains all these replacements. If so, and if all replaced migrations are being unapplied, this squashed migration should also be marked as unapplied. This adjustment ensures the state of the squashed migration accurately reflects the state of its constituent migrations, maintaining database schema consistency without altering the current functionality for non-squashed migrations."
