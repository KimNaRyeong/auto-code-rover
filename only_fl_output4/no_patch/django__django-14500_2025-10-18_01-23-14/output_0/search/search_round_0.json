This is a bit of a guess, but it's based on the context provided in the issue.\n\n3. `search_code(\"squashed migration\")`: To get more context on how the term \"squashed migration\" is used within the codebase. This will help in understanding how squashed migrations are typically handled or referenced in the project."
