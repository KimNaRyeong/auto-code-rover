        "content": "Given the context collected from the API calls, let's analyze the information and consider the potential steps toward resolving the issue with squashed migrations not being marked as unapplied.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. MigrationExecutor Class\nThe `MigrationExecutor` class is found within `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. It includes methods for handling migration operations such as applying, unapplying migrations, and more. Notably, the methods `apply_migration`, `unapply_migration`, and possibly `record_migration` could be directly related to the issue at hand. Since the \"mark\" method was not found, it's likely that the action of marking migrations as applied or unapplied is done through these methods or involves updating some state indirectly related to these operations.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** Since the bug involves squashed migrations not being properly marked as unapplied, focusing on the `unapply_migration` method and any method that updates the migration state would be critical. Understanding how these methods handle the state of squashed migrations and their replacements is crucial.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The desired behavior would be for the `MigrationExecutor` to also mark squashed migrations as unapplied when their replaced migrations are unapplied. This likely involves ensuring that the state of a squashed migration is appropriately updated in scenarios where the replaced migrations are unapplied.\n\n#### 2. Search Code for \"squashed migration\"\nThe term \"squashed migration\" appears in multiple files, including `loader.py`, `graph.py`, `executor.py`, and commands related to migrations like `squashmigrations.py` and `showmigrations.py`. These references indicate that squashed migrations are handled or referenced across different parts of the Django migrations framework, including loading migrations, managing migration dependencies, and specific management commands.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The references to \"squashed migration\" across these files suggest that handling squashed migrations is a cross-cutting concern in the migrations framework. The files may contain logic related to recognizing, loading, and processing squashed migrations, which could directly impact how these migrations are marked as applied or unapplied.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** In the context of squashed migrations, the code should ensure that when migrations are unapplied, the squashed migration's state reflects this change if the replaced migrations are still present. This ensures consistency in the migration history and prevents potential issues with database schema inconsistencies.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the initial analysis, the next steps could involve:\n\n1. **Investigate `unapply_migration` Method:** An in-depth look into the `unapply_migration` method in `executor.py` is required to understand how it currently handles the state of migrations, particularly focusing on squashed migrations.\n\n2. **Explore how Squashed Migrations are Handled:** Utilize the references found in `loader.py`, `graph.py`, and `squashmigrations.py` to understand the lifecycle of a squashed migration from creation to application and unapplication. This involves looking at how squashed migrations are loaded, identified, and manipulated through the Django management commands and during runtime.\n\nTo gather more specific information, further API calls could include:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"unapply_migration\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")`: To examine the implementation details of the `unapply_migration` method.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"squashed migration\", \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\")`: Since the loader is likely responsible for identifying and loading migrations, understanding how it treats squashed migrations could reveal insights into the issue.\n- Other API calls could target specific methods or code snippets in `graph.py` and `squashmigrations.py` related to handling squashed migrations."

This involves managing the state of squashed migrations in a way that reflects their unapplied status when the migrations they replace are unapplied. The existing functionality of handling individual and non-squashed migrations as unapplied should be preserved.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- File: django/db/migrations/loader.py\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Within the migrations loader, there should be clear handling of squashed migrations, ensuring that their state accurately reflects the state of the migrations they have replaced. If a replaced migration is marked as unapplied, the loader should consider this when loading and representing the state of squashed migrations. This does not imply a specific method but a behavior that might need to be introduced or adapted in the class handling migration loading.

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. unapply_migration Method in MigrationExecutor\n\n##### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class is responsible for running a migration backwards (i.e., unapplying it). If the migration is not being faked (`fake=False`), it physically reverts the changes made by the migration using a schema editor. For migrations that replace others (i.e., squashed migrations), it records the unapplication of each replaced migration individually. Finally, it signals the progress of the unapplication to any registered callback.\n\n##### Relationship to the Bug\nThe bug involves squashed migrations not being correctly marked as unapplied when the replaced migration files are still around. The current implementation does address the recording of unapplied states for replaced migrations but does not explicitly ensure that the squashed migration itself is correctly managed in terms of its unapplied status alongside the individual migrations it replaces.\n\n##### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior should include a check or mechanism to correctly mark the squashed migration as unapplied in the scenario where its replaced migrations are unapplied. This process should maintain the integrity of the migration history and state, ensuring the database schema consistency. It seems the current handling of replaced migrations needs to extend to consider the squashed migration's status more explicitly in such scenarios.\n\n#### 2. check_consistent_history Method in MigrationLoader\n\n##### What does this part of the code do?\nIn `MigrationLoader`, the `check_consistent_history` function checks for consistent migration history. Specifically, it includes logic to handle squashed migrations by checking if all replaced migrations (`replaces`) are applied. If so, it can ignore unapplied squashed migrations, assuming a consistent history.\n\n##### Relationship to the Bug\nThis method's handling of squashed migrations reveals part of the system's logic for determining migration consistency. The issue with squashed migrations not being marked as unapplied may relate to how these migrations and their replaced counterparts are evaluated for consistency and state representation.\n\n##### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior here could involve enhancing this consistency check to better accommodate scenarios where a squashed migration might not correctly reflect its state in relation to its replaced migrations. Although this method directly deals with checking history rather than setting or unsetting application status, ensuring that the system's understanding and representation of squashed migrations are consistent and accurate is pivotal. This could indirectly affect how migrations are marked as applied or unapplied by providing clearer conditions or checks that could be used when managing migration states, especially in context to squashed migrations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe investigation shows that while the `unapply_migration` method in `MigrationExecutor` directly relates to handling the unapplication of migrations, including squashed migrations and their replacements, adjustments or additional checks might be necessary to correctly manage the squashed migration's unapplied status.\n\nIn `MigrationLoader`, the way squashed migrations and their consistency checks are handled could influence how migration states are represented and managed across the system, though this might not directly fix the bug but could contribute to a more robust solution.\n\nConsidering these insights, we might need more targeted adjustments in the `MigrationExecutor` class, especially within the `unapply_migration` method, to resolve the issue effectively. Additionally, understanding the broader system logic for handling squashed migrations, as seen in `MigrationLoader`, can guide the adequate handling of squashed migrations' states."

Specifically, after the current logic that handles the replacement migrations (lines 253-258), there should be an additional check to see if a squashed migration exists that contains all these replacements. If so, and if all replaced migrations are being unapplied, this squashed migration should also be marked as unapplied. This adjustment ensures the state of the squashed migration accurately reflects the state of its constituent migrations, maintaining database schema consistency without altering the current functionality for non-squashed migrations.\n\n**Bug Location 2:** [No additional bug locations are identified based on the current context and issue description.]\n\nThe collected information and analysis suggest that the focus for resolving the issue should be on adjusting the `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class. This should ensure squashed migrations are correctly marked as unapplied to reflect the state of their replaced migrations accurately. No further context is deemed necessary based on the information available and analyzed. This approach preserves existing functionalities around migration application and rollback while introducing the needed fix for squashed migrations."
