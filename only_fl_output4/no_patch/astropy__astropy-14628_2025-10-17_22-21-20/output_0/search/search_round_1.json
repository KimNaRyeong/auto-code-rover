        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `EarthLocation` Class Overview\nThe `EarthLocation` class, defined in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py`, serves as a container for Earth-based location information in various coordinate frames (e.g., geodetic, geocentric). It provides conversion methods between these coordinate systems, methods to interact with predefined Earth locations (e.g., `of_site`), and functionalities to create `ITRS` objects. The class inherits from `u.Quantity`, indicating its integration within the broader astropy units framework.\n\n#### `get_itrs` Method in `EarthLocation`\nThe `get_itrs` method generates an `astropy.coordinates.ITRS` (International Terrestrial Reference System) object representing the EarthLocation instance's position at a specified `obstime` (observation time). If `obstime` is not provided, a default is used. The current implementation is focused on converting the instance\u2019s coordinates (`x`, `y`, `z`) to an `ITRS` object at the given time but does not consider the relative position from another geographic location.\n\n#### `EARTH_CENTER`\nOccurrences of `EARTH_CENTER` in various files (`equatorial.py`, `cirs.py`, etc.) suggest its usage in coordinate transformations and reference frame definitions. This constant presumably represents Earth's center in various calculations, potentially pertinent as a default value for modifications in the `get_itrs` method to support topocentric positions.\n\n### Relation to the Issue\n1. **`EarthLocation Class`**: Understanding the `EarthLocation` class is crucial since the enhancement involves adding functionality to enable easy generation of topocentric ITRS positions. The class's existing structure and methods provide a foundation upon which this new feature will build, specifically leveraging methods like `get_itrs`.\n\n2. **`get_itrs` Method**: This method is directly tied to the issue as the enhancement proposes adding a new `location` parameter to this method to facilitate creating topocentric ITRS positions. Understanding its current behavior is essential to implementing the proposed changes. The current implementation focuses solely on geocentric positions relative to the Earth's center, without considering an external relocation point.\n\n3. **`EARTH_CENTER` Usage**: Given the suggestion to use `EARTH_CENTER` as a default argument for the new `location` parameter, knowing where and how `EARTH_CENTER` is currently utilized can offer insights into how to integrate it within the `get_itrs` method. It also implies the need to maintain consistency with existing conventions of representing Earth's center in astropy's coordinate frames.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Enhancement\nAfter the enhancement, the `get_itrs` method should:\n- Accept an optional `location` argument, which specifies a reference location for topocentric position calculations.\n- Use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default value for `location`, ensuring backwards compatibility with the method's current behavior (which implicitly uses Earth's center for ITRS coordinates).\n- When a `location` is specified, return an ITRS frame representing the position relative to this location instead of the geocentric position, facilitating topocentric observations.\n\nThis enhancement directly facilitates easier and more intuitive creation of topocentric positions for Earth-based observations within the astropy ecosystem, improving usability and reducing the need for complex, manual calculations by the end-users."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

If `location` is provided, the method computes the ITRS position relative to this `location` instead of the default geocentric position. This `location` should be another `EarthLocation` instance, allowing the computation of a topocentric position relative to it. When `location` is `None`, the method should retain its current behavior for backward compatibility. This implies:\n     - Adding logic to handle the subtraction of the `location` coordinates from the instance's coordinates when `location` is not `None`, before creating the `ITRS` object.\n     - The method's documentation should be updated to describe the new `location` parameter and its usage.\n     - Incorporating checks and potential coordinate transformations if needed to ensure the `location` argument is correctly used for the calculation.\n     - Defaulting to `EARTH_CENTER` if `location` is not provided requires understanding `EARTH_CENTER`'s current usage within the project and ensuring the proposed functionality aligns with these conventions."
