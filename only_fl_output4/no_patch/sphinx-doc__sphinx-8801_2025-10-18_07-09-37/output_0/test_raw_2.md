Given the feedback and the requirement to ensure the program exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, I'll adjust the logic in the `reproducer.py` script. We must ensure Sphinx documentation generation is being validated correctly, especially taking into account the specific error encountered during file access. This version will include more robust error handling around the Sphinx build process and file access, and will ensure the environment setup is more fail-proof.

The modified version of the script will attempt to more carefully handle the Sphinx documentation build process, ensuring that `build/index.html` is checked for existence before trying to open it, and will include better error reporting on the Sphinx build failure:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import subprocess

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    os.makedirs('source', exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs('build', exist_ok=True)
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
        f.write("master_doc = 'index'\n")
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. autoclass:: example.Bar\n")
        f.write("   :members:\n")
        f.write("   :inherited-members:\n")
    with open('example.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write(
            "class Foo:\n"
            "    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n"
            "    attr1: int  #: docstring\n\n"
            "class Bar(Foo):\n"
            "    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n"
            "    attr2: str  #: docstring\n"
        )

def build_sphinx():
    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-W', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'], text=True, capture_output=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Sphinx build failed:\n{result.stdout}\n{result.stderr}")
    return result

def check_documentation():
    index_html_path = 'build/index.html'
    if not os.path.exists(index_html_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"{index_html_path} not found. Sphinx build might have failed.")
    with open(index_html_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if 'attr1' not in content or 'attr2' not in content:
            raise AssertionError("Inherited attribute documentation is missing.")
    return True

def main():
    setup_sphinx_project()
    try:
        build_sphinx()
        if check_documentation():
            print("Issue is not present, documentation generated as expected.")
            sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version pays special attention to:
- Handling the case where the Sphinx build might fail, by checking the return code of the subprocess running Sphinx. 
- Ensuring that `build/index.html` is actually generated before trying to read it.
- Using the `-W` flag with Sphinx build to make all warnings into errors, ensuring that the build fails fast if there's an issue with Sphinx processing.

Please make sure Sphinx is correctly installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`) and run this script in the root directory of your project.
