Given the constraints and requirements, here is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` intended to reproduce the described issue within the specific context. If the script identifies the problem, it will print a stack trace of the error, adhering to the provided method for doing so. The script will exit with code 0 once the issue is addressed and no longer raises an `AssertionError`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_ndcg_with_binary_relevance_and_single_element():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]
    
    try:
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        # If the score is successfully computed, the expected issue is not present
        print("NDCG score computation succeeded unexpectedly.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed or not present.
    except ValueError as e:
        # If a ValueError is caught, it's expected due to the issue described.
        # We assert that the error message matches the expected issue.
        assert "Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported." in str(e), "Unexpected error message."
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        # For any other unexpected exceptions, print the stack trace and raise the exception.
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_ndcg_with_binary_relevance_and_single_element()
```

This script checks for the specific behavior describedâ€”namely, that computing the NDCG score with binary relevance and a single element list fails as expected given the issue. If the computation unexpectedly succeeds, indicating a potential resolution or different behavior in the function, it exits with code 0. It uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to ensure any errors are displayed with clear line numbers for better diagnosis.

Make sure you have the correct version of scikit-learn installed and that all dependencies are properly set up before executing this script in your project's root directory.
