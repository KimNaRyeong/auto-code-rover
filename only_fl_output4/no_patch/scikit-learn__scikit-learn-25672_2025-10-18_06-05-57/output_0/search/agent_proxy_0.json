            "content": "To address the issue described, we need to explore the implementation details of the `ndcg_score` method and the `_check_dcg_target_type` function mentioned in the traceback. It's also helpful to understand how these components integrate within the broader metrics system of the sklearn library. We'll start by locating the `ndcg_score` method and the `_check_dcg_target_type` function in the codebase. Additionally, it will be beneficial to find the context in which the `_check_dcg_target_type` is called within the `ndcg_score` method. Given the information from the issue, let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"ndcg_score\")`: This will help locate the `ndcg_score` method in the sklearn library, providing file paths or class names where the method is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"_check_dcg_target_type\")`: This will locate the `_check_dcg_target_type` function, which is crucial for understanding the input validation process that leads to the error.\n3. `search_code(\"metrics.ndcg_score(t, p)\")`: Although this code snippet directly calls `ndcg_score`, finding instances of such calls might provide insight into how the method is expected to be used within the library or by its users.\n4. `search_code(\"_check_dcg_target_type(y_true)\")`: This search will help us understand the context in which `_check_dcg_target_type` is called within the `ndcg_score` implementation or elsewhere, shedding light on its role in input validation.\n\nThese calls are aimed at gathering a comprehensive understanding of the issue by examining the functions and methods directly involved in the error and their usage in the project."
