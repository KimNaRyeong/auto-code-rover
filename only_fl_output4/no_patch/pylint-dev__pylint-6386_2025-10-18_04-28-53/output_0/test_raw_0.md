Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to automate the detection of the reported issue with Pylint regarding the `-v` or `--verbose` options. This script tries to run Pylint using a subprocess on a temporary file. It checks if the `-v` option behaves as expected (without requiring an argument, which mirrors the `--verbose` behavior). It triggers an `AssertionError` if the problematic behavior (expecting an argument for `-v`) is detected.

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile

def run_pylint(file_path, verbose_option):
    """
    Run pylint on the given file with the specified verbose option.
    """
    command = ['pylint', file_path, verbose_option]
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """
    Prints the stack trace of an exception.
    """
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pylint_verbose_option_behavior():
    """
    Tests the behavior of the verbose option with Pylint.
    """
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w', suffix='.py', delete=False) as tmpfile:
        tmpfile.write("# Temporary file for pylint testing.\n")

    try:
        # Testing long verbose option which should not require an argument.
        long_option_result = run_pylint(tmpfile.name, '--verbose')
        assert 'expected one argument' not in long_option_result.stderr, \
            "Long verbose option (--verbose) should not require an argument."

        # Testing short verbose option which should also not require an argument
        # to mirror the long option behavior.
        short_option_result = run_pylint(tmpfile.name, '-v')
        assert 'expected one argument' not in short_option_result.stderr, \
            "Short verbose option (-v) should not require an argument."

        print("Test passed: Short verbose option behaves as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_pylint_verbose_option_behavior()
    except AssertionError as error:
        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code indicates failure
    else:
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed or not present
```

This script proceeds as follows:
1. Creates a temporary Python file to serve as the target for Pylint checks.
2. Runs Pylint with both the long (`--verbose`) and short (`-v`) verbose options on the temporary file using the `subprocess` module. It captures and inspects the standard error output for the specific error message that indicates an argument was expected.
3. Asserts that the erroneous behavior (expecting an argument for `-v`) does not occur. If the assertion fails (meaning the issue is present), a stack trace is printed detailing where the failure occurred within this script.
4. Exits with code 0 if the script runs successfully without detecting the issue, indicating the problem is either fixed or absent. Exits with code 1 if an `AssertionError` is raised, signifying the issue is present.
