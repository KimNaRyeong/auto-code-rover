If Pylint is not found, it exits with an error message indicating that Pylint must be installed. When Pylint is confirmed to be present, it attempts to reproduce the issue by invoking Pylint with the verbose flag (`-v`). The script checks for the specific error message that was reported to occur when the issue is present. If the error is detected (meaning the `-v` option incorrectly expects an argument), it prints a stack trace. Otherwise, it confirms that the verbose option behaves as expected without requiring an argument."
