        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we should start by locating where the `hamming_loss` function is defined in the codebase. Since `hamming_loss` is a specifically named function, we can directly search for it using the method search API. This should give us insight into where the changes need to be made, especially regarding the removal of the `labels` parameter and the adjustment related to `len(labels)` to `y_true.shape[1]`. \n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"hamming_loss\")`: To find the definition and usage of `hamming_loss` across the codebase. \n\n2. `search_code(\"len(labels)\")`: This will help identify parts of the code where `labels` length is currently used, which is critical for understanding how to refactor `len(labels)` to `y_true.shape[1]`.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the scope of changes needed for Issue #10580."
