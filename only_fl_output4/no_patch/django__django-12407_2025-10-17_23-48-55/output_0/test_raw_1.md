To create a correct standalone Python file that reproduces the Django template issue as described, you can use the information provided to draft a script that sets up a minimal Django environment, attempts to render templates using the `include` tag with a list of template options, and checks whether Django's behavior matches the expected behavior (i.e., being able to use `select_template` instead of `get_template` to allow for template fallbacks within the `include` tag).

The updated script below rectifies the environment setup issue by ensuring Django settings are correctly configured within the script. Note that for this example, the script is designed assuming no external Django project settings file is being used (hence, we configure settings programmatically within the script). 

Additionally, the expectation here is that you have a minimal Django setup ready, and that the Django app is set up with at least one template that exists (e.g., `admin/base_site.html`) and one that does not exist (e.g., `admin/fail.html`). If you're running this in an environment without the Django admin app installed or without templates in the expected locations, you might need to adjust the template paths accordingly.

```python
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Template, Context

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
        ],
        TEMPLATES=[{
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
        }],
        SECRET_KEY='a_secret_key',
    )
    django.setup()

def reproduce_issue():
    template_code = '{% include var %}'
    ctx = Context({'var': ['admin/base_site.html', 'admin/fail.html']})
    
    try:
        template = Template(template_code)
        # Attempt to render the template with a list of templates
        rendered = template.render(ctx)
        # If no exception is raised, assume the issue is fixed
        print("Success: The issue appears to be fixed.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_django_environment()
    issue_fixed = reproduce_issue()
    assert issue_fixed == True, "AssertionError: The issue is present."
```

Before running this script, ensure you have Django installed and properly set up. This script is designed to be run in a Python environment where Django is installed (`pip install django`). Note that the `setup_django_environment()` function is configuring Django settings programmatically for the sole purpose of this reproduction script and might not reflect your production or development settings.

Execute this script from the root directory of your Django project (or any location if you're not dependent on project-specific templates) using:
```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

The script should exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., Django's `include` tag can successfully select from a list of templates), and it should print a stack trace followed by an `AssertionError` if the issue is present.
