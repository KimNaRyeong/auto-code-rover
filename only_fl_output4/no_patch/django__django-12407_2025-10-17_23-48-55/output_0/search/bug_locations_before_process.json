        "intended_behavior": "The `render` method inside the `IncludeNode` class should be modified to use `select_template` instead of `get_template`. This change will allow `IncludeNode` to accept an iterable of template names (a list or tuple), attempting to load the first template that exists, rather than failing upon the first attempt with a single template that does not exist. This modification will enable template fallback functionality within the `{% include %}` tag, increasing its robustness and flexibility. The modification should preserve the existing functionality for cases where a single template name is provided, ensuring backward compatibility."
