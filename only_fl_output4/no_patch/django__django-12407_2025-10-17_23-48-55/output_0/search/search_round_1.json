        "content": "The collected context provides insight into the implementation details and usage patterns of the `IncludeNode` class, and the `get_template` and `select_template` methods within Django's template system. Let's analyze the results:\n\n### Analysis of `IncludeNode`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `IncludeNode` class is likely responsible for handling the `{% include %}` template tag in Django templates. This tag dynamically includes another template within a template. However, the snippet does not provide detail on how templates are located and loaded.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  The issue relates to the `IncludeNode`'s current behavior of not supporting fallback templates through the `{% include %}` tag. The bug report suggests that `IncludeNode` uses the `get_template` method, which does not support a list of template names for fallback scenarios.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  The intended behavior would be for `IncludeNode` to use `select_template` instead of `get_template`, allowing a list of templates to be specified, from which the first successfully located template is used. This change would make template inclusion more flexible and consistent with other parts of the Django templating system.\n\n### Analysis of `get_template`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `get_template` method is used across various parts of Django's templating engine to locate and load a single template by name. From the bug report and the general description in the search results, `get_template` does not accept a list of template names, which suggests it's designed to work with a single, explicit template name.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  `get_template`'s limitation to single template names is directly related to the issue. The current implementation restricts the `IncludeNode` from supporting template fallbacks, which limits the tag's flexibility and usability.\n\n### Analysis of `select_template`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `select_template` method accepts an iterable of template names and attempts to load the first template that can be found. It's designed explicitly to support fallback behaviors, trying template names in order and stopping at the first successful load.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  `select_template` exhibits the intended behavior for solving the issue at hand. It's meant for scenarios where multiple templates might serve as suitable fallbacks, and only one needs to be loaded based on availability.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  Integrating `select_template` into the `IncludeNode` implementation is the proposed solution to the issue. To make `{% include %}` support fallback templates, `IncludeNode` should attempt to load templates using a list of names, precisely what `select_template` is designed for.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe collected context leads to a clear path forward: modify `IncludeNode` to use `select_template` instead of `get_template`. This change should enable the desired behavior of supporting fallback templates in the `{% include %}` tag. To further this goal, the next step would likely involve examining `IncludeNode`'s `render` method (or equivalent) within `django/template/loader_tags.py` to see how `get_template` is currently used and to replace it with an appropriate call to `select_template`."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This change will allow `IncludeNode` to accept an iterable of template names (a list or tuple), attempting to load the first template that exists, rather than failing upon the first attempt with a single template that does not exist. This modification will enable template fallback functionality within the `{% include %}` tag, increasing its robustness and flexibility. The modification should preserve the existing functionality for cases where a single template name is provided, ensuring backward compatibility."
