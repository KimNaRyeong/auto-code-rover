Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

This indicates that part of the bug description might refer to changes or deprecations not directly visible in the constructor's signature.\n   - The method `_validate_params` wasn't found within the `AdaBoostClassifier`, suggesting that parameter validation might be inherited or delegated to another method or class.\n\n2. **Relationship Between the Code and the Bug**:\n   - Considering the error message and the issue description, the validation of the `base_estimator` parameter fails when it is set to `None`. Given that the `AdaBoostClassifier` constructor has a `base_estimator` parameter with a default value of `\"deprecated\"`, and there isn't a direct `_validate_params` method in `AdaBoostClassifier`, the validation logic that triggers the error is likely implemented elsewhere. \n   - The absence of `_validate_params` in `AdaBoostClassifier` leads to the likelihood that parameter validation, particularly for deprecated parameters, is a concern of a base class or utility function.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior for handling the `base_estimator=None` argument should involve recognizing `None` as an acceptable value, especially for cases where users want to rely on default estimators. This adjustment mainly relates to supporting backward compatibility and easing the transition for users dealing with deprecation warnings.\n   \nGiven these observations and questions generated from the analysis, it seems necessary to explore further into how `AdaBoostClassifier` inherits or delegates its parameter validation mechanism. It's also crucial to understand the default behavior when `base_estimator` is `None` and how the new `estimator` parameter expectation plays into this.\n\nTo gain more context, additional API call(s) should aim at uncovering the mechanism of parameter validation and handling of `base_estimator` and `estimator`. Relevant API calls could include:\n- Investigating the inheritance hierarchy of `AdaBoostClassifier` to identify where `_validate_params` could be implemented or utilized. This may involve looking into base classes such as `BaseWeightBoosting`.\n- Exploring where `validate_parameter_constraints` is used within `sklearn/base.py` and `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` to understand its role in parameter validation. \n\nNext steps should include:\n- search_method_in_class(\"_validate_params\", \"BaseWeightBoosting\")\n- get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/base.py\", 600, 10)"
