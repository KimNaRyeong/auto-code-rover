        "intended_behavior": "The constructor and/or `_validate_estimator` method need to be updated to handle `base_estimator=None` appropriately. When `base_estimator=None` is encountered, the behavior should default to using the standard default estimator without raising an error, preserving backward compatibility while adhering to the deprecation path. The handling of `base_estimator=\"deprecated\"` should also ensure a clear warning is provided, guiding the users toward the new `estimator` parameter use, if applicable, or confirming that `None` remains a valid input to select the default estimator automatically. This change would involve ensuring that any checks or validations that happen either at construction or during the call to `_validate_estimator` do not invalidate `None` as an entry for `base_estimator` during the period that this deprecation warning is meant to guide user transition. Additional comments or documentation should be added explaining that `None` is explicitly allowed to ensure that there is no confusion for future maintainers of the codebase."
