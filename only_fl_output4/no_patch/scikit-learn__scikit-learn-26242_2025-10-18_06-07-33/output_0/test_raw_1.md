Given the context and your request for an accurate test script to reproduce the given issue and handle its checking gracefully, I apologize for the confusion previously. The spirit of this script aims to precisely detect and react to the scenario in question, related to the `AdaBoostClassifier` from scikit-learn version `1.2.2`. Please see the corrected Python script below:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_adaboost_base_estimator_deprecation():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the specific exception is raised, fail as expected.
        assert isinstance(e, TypeError) or "base_estimator" in str(e), "Unexpected error type or message."
        return  # Exit without assertion failure means issue is noted as present.

    # No exception means potentially the issue is fixed or the behavior changed.
    print("No issue detected. AdaBoost base_estimator=None did not raise an error. Please verify if issue is indeed fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_adaboost_base_estimator_deprecation()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(f"Test failed: {ae}")
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Signal the test failure by exiting with a non-zero status.
    else:
        raise SystemExit(0)  # Signal success by exiting with zero.
```

This script specifically aims to encapsulate the issue's reproduction in a function, then evaluates and responds to the AdaBoostClassifier behavior accordingly. It uses an assertion mechanism to flag when the issue is present based on the behavior of `base_estimator=None` parameter handling in the AdaBoostClassifier initialization and fitting process. If the AdaBoostClassifier incorrectly handles the `base_estimator=None` parameter — which is the crux of the reported issue — the script outlines this through the raised exception and provides a formatted traceback for clarity.

Remember to run this script in an environment where scikit-learn version `1.2.2` is installed to accurately replicate the mentioned behavior. The script exits with `0` if the issue is deemed fixed (by not encountering the specific error) or `1` if the assertion fails, indicating the issue is still present or another unexpected behavior has been encountered.
