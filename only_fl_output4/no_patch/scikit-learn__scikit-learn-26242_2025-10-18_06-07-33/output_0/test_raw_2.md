Below is a Python script designed to reproduce the specified issue regarding `AdaBoostClassifier`'s handling of `base_estimator=None` in scikit-learn version 1.2.2, considering the provided traceback printing function for clarity in error reporting. This script asserts the existence of the issue by catching the relevant exception and checks whether the behavior is as expected (raises an error when `base_estimator=None` is used). If the issue is resolved (no error is raised), it exits with code `0`, indicating success, otherwise, it prints the stack trace of the error and exits with code `1` to indicate failure.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
        # If no exception occurs, assume issue is resolved.
        print("No issue detected: The operation completed successfully.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier" in str(e), \
            "The script failed with an unexpected error."

        # Exit with code 1 to indicate the specific anticipated failure occurred.
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Instructions:**

- Save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
- Ensure you have the correct version of scikit-learn installed where the issue exists. This script assumes version `1.2.2` or the version where the described behavior is present.
- Execute the script using Python 3: `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script attempts to initialize and fit an `AdaBoostClassifier` with `base_estimator=None`, which is expected to raise an exception due to the deprecation and handling issues mentioned. The exception's message is checked to confirm it matches the anticipated failure related to the `base_estimator`. If the execution encounters an unknown error or completes successfully (indicating the issue might have been resolved), it handles these outcomes accordingly by adjusting the exit code and providing feedback.
