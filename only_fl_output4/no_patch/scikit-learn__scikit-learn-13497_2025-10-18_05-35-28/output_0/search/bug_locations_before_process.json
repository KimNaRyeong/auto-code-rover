        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the `discrete_features` parameter within `_estimate_mi` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it can correctly identify and process different types of inputs (i.e., 'auto', boolean array, indices array) for `discrete_features`. Specifically, the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` should be safeguarded against future numpy versions' compatibility issues, likely by adding an explicit type check before this comparison to ensure that `discrete_features` is being compared as a string when intended. Additionally, for instances where `discrete_features` is an array, the method should intelligibly handle it by accurately creating a mask for discrete features whether it represents a boolean mask or an array of indices, thus facilitating the function's ability to estimate mutual information with both discrete and continuous features accurately. This means refining the subsequent conditions and processing logic after the initial auto check to cater to the nuances of `discrete_features` being an array without relying on behavior that may be deprecated in future versions of dependencies."
