This script attempts to reproduce the mentioned issue by constructing a `Pipeline` object and checking its length. The `AssertionError` will indicate the issue is present if the `pipe` object doesn't return the expected length. I've included a try-except block that utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to print the stack trace clearly if an exception is encountered. This script exits with code 0 when the issue does not occur.
