Based on your request and the initial issue description about sklearn's `Pipeline` implementation lacking a `__len__` method, here is a `reproducer.py` script. This script includes a check to assert that `len(pipe)` does not raise an error, and it uses the detailed stack trace printing function as you requested to show where the error occurs if the assertion fails:

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn import svm
        from sklearn.datasets import samples_generator
        from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
        from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression
        from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

        # generate some data to play with
        X, y = samples_generator.make_classification(
            n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

        anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
        clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
        pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])

        # Check if Pipeline implements __len__
        assert len(pipe) == 2, "Pipeline __len__ not correctly implemented."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The script attempts to reproduce the issue by creating a `Pipeline` with two steps and then asserting that calling `len()` on this pipeline does not raise an exception and indeed returns the expected length of 2. If an assertion error occurs, it signifies that the `Pipeline`'s `__len__` method is not working as expected, either due to not being implemented or due to some bug. The script captures both `AssertionError` to provide a specific assertion failure message in the stack trace, and other general exceptions which might arise, printing their stack traces using the provided function. If an error is encountered that results in an exception, the script exits with code 1, indicating a failure. If the pipeline length matches the expectation, the script exits normally with code 0, indicating success.
