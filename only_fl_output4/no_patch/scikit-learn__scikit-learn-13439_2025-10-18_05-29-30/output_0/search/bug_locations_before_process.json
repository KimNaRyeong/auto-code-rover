        "intended_behavior": "The `Pipeline` class should include the `__len__` method which returns the length of the `steps` list, providing the number of steps in the pipeline. This method will allow users to call `len(pipeline_instance)` to get the number of steps, matching the expected behavior of Python's built-in `len` function when applied to list-like objects. This does not alter existing functionalities but adds a new feature that improves the `Pipeline` class's usability. The implementation should be straightforward, possibly a one-liner:\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.steps)"
