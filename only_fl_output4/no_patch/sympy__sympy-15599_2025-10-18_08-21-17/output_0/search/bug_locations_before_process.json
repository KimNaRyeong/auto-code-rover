        "class": "Mod",
        "method": "eval",
        "intended_behavior": "The `eval` method within the `Mod` class should include additional logic to recognize and simplify expressions of the form `Mod(n*i, m)` to `Mod(i, m)` under appropriate mathematical conditions, such as when `n` and `m` are coprime (or under other conditions that justify this simplification based on the properties of modulus operation). This enhancement aims to fix the issue where certain expressions are not simplified as expected, without affecting the existing functionality of `Mod` for other types of expressions. The modification should specifically address the problem outlined in the issue description by ensuring that `Mod(3*i, 2)` simplifies to `Mod(i, 2)`, reflecting a more mathematically optimized and correct behavior while maintaining backward compatibility and the general correctness of the `Mod` functionality across other uses in SymPy."
