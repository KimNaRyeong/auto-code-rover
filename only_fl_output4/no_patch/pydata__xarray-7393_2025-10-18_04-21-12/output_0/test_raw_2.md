Given the requirement to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and to ensure clear execution control flow depending on the result, here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that directly aims to match the specified behavior:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    import numpy as np

    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    result = ds['a'].values.dtype == ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype

    try:
        assert result, "The dtype of the coordinate has unexpectedly changed from 'i4' to 'i8'."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensuring an exit code of 0 when the issue is fixed implies that the script should NOT exit with non-zero here
        # A non-zero code should only be used to indicate failure/error conditions
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

In this script:

- The function `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` is utilized precisely as instructed for error reporting purposes. It captures the traceback of any caught `AssertionError` triggered by the main functionality test and prints it to `stderr`.
- The main functionality, wrapped in the `main()` function, involves creating a dataset with `xarray` and asserting the expected condition related to data types (`'i4'` vs. `'i8'`). If the condition fails, the `AssertionError` is caught, its detailed stack trace is printed, and the program exits with code `1` to indicate the presence of the issue.
- If the script executes without encountering the `AssertionError`, it simply reaches the end of `main()` and exits; since Python scripts exit with code `0` by default when not explicitly specified, this behavior implies the issue is fixed or not present.

This approach ensures that the script's behavior is exactly as specified: it will exit with code `1` upon failure (i.e., if the issue is reproduced), thus directly indicating the problem persists.
