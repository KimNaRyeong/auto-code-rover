        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the `model` attribute on the `ImageField` (or `FileField`, if the inheritance structure is where the change impacted the `ImageField`) correctly reflects the concrete model it is attached to. This might involve re-establishing a direct or indirect linkage between the field and its parent model during field initialization or through some form of model-field registration mechanism that was affected by the Django 3.2 update. The exact change would depend on how Django intended to handle this relationship post the changes in 3.2 and ensuring that any workarounds or fixes do not break existing functionality or introspection capabilities that rely on accessing `model` from image fields."
