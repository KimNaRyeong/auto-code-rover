But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's dive into the analysis of the results and how they relate to the non-deterministic crash issue in `django.db.models.sql.Query.combine()`:\n\n### Analysis of `Query` class and `combine` method\n\n**1. What does the `Query.combine` method do?**\n\nThe `Query.combine` method is designed to merge two `Query` objects (`self` and `rhs`, the right-hand side query) into a single query. This merging is dictated by the `connector` parameter, which specifies how the filters from the `rhs` query should be connected to the `self` query. The method ensures that the models of both queries are the same, checks for the ability to filter, and enforces rules about distinctness and distinct fields being compatible across the queries being combined.\n\n**2. Relationship between `Query.combine` and the bug**\n\nThe bug is an assertion error within the `Query.combine` method, specifically due to the existence of circular references within the `change_map`. The `change_map` is crucial for relabeling the aliases of the right-hand side query so that they don't conflict with the ones in the left-hand (or current) query when merging. The non-deterministic nature of the crash suggests that the content and handling of `change_map` might depend on factors that vary between executions, such as the order of dictionaries and sets in Python 3, as suspected by the issue's author.\n\n**3. Intended behavior of `Query.combine` related to the issue**\n\nIdeally, `Query.combine` should handle complex queries, including those with self-joins and many-to-many relationships, without causing assertion errors. The handling of `change_map` should be robust against the creation of circular dependencies, and the processing of aliases should ensure that every execution reliably produces a correct and stable merged query regardless of the internal ordering of Python's data structures.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the issue's description and the codebase context, the next steps could include:\n\n1. **Reviewing How `change_map` Is Constructed and Used:** Since the assertion error and non-determinism seem to originate from how `change_map` manages aliases, a deeper dive into its assignment and update process throughout the `combine` method would be prudent. This could reveal a path or condition under which circular references might be introduced.\n\n2. **Exploring the Call Sites and Usage Patterns of `Query.combine`:** Since no direct usage of `combine` was found in relation to the `Invoice` model (due to the missing class and code snippet in the search results), investigating more broadly where and how `Query.combine` is invoked in the codebase could provide clues. It's possible the issue arises under specific conditions that are not immediately evident from the `combine` method itself.\n\n3. **Considering Python 3's Changes to Data Structures:** The issue description hints at Python 3\u2019s changes affecting the behavior. Specifically, the order of items in data structures like dictionaries and sets in Python 3 is deterministic in a way it wasn't in Python 2. However, relying on this order without explicit guarantees could lead to issues. Reviewing assumptions about order-sensitive operations in `combine` and surrounding logic might be necessary.\n\nGiven the unsuccessful search for the `Invoice` model and the specified usage of `Invoice.objects.filter`, an alternative approach could involve:\n\n- **Searching for Related Models or Queries**: Since the direct search for `Invoice` and its query didn't yield results, searching for related models (e.g., `Customer`) or more generic query patterns that might typically involve the `Invoice` model could provide alternate paths to understand how the queries are constructed and executed.\n  \n- **Broader Search in Related Files**: The bug might be indirectly influenced by customized behavior or extensions in related areas, such as custom managers or query expressions defined elsewhere in the codebase."

To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should ensure:\n\n- **No Circular References in `change_map`:** Modify the logic that constructs and uses `change_map` to prevent the creation of circular references. This might involve adding checks or redesigning the alias relabeling logic to detect potential circular mappings before applying them. \n\n- **Deterministic Behavior:** Given the non-deterministic nature of the crash likely related to the ordering of data structures, the method should work consistently across executions for the same input. This could necessitate changes to how sets and dictionaries are iterated or merged, ensuring that the operation's outcome does not inadvertently rely on the iteration order.\n\n- **Preservation of Existing Functionality:** Any modifications to `combine` must not disrupt its current capabilities, especially its handling of merging query conditions, alias management, and enforcement of query constraints (e.g., model compatibility, filter capability, distinctness). The method should continue to support complex query scenarios without introducing regressions.\n\n- **Enhanced Error Handling and Validation:** Introduce better error handling or assertions specifically tailored to catch invalid states early. This could include more descriptive messages or checks that help diagnose how and why invalid `change_map` states arise.\n\nThese modifications aim to fix the non-deterministic crashes by addressing the root cause(s) related to alias relabeling logic and data structure order dependencies, ensuring that `Query.combine` works reliably for complex queries."
