This method should mirror the functionality of the `quantile` method in the `DataArrayGroupBy` class, enabling users to compute quantiles over grouped datasets. The `quantile` method should be capable of computing the qth quantile over each variable in the grouped datasets and concatenating these into a new dataset object. This involves handling the quantile computation logic across all dataset variables grouped by certain criteria, supporting various quantile interpolation methods (`linear`, `lower`, `higher`, `midpoint`, `nearest`), and allowing for the optional retention of attributes (`keep_attrs`). The implementation should ensure that the computation is appropriately applied across the grouped dimensions and that the result is a dataset that aggregates the quantile computations from its constituent data arrays. This addition will align the behavior of `DatasetGroupBy` objects with the documented functionality and user expectations, thus resolving the issue."
