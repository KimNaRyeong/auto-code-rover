Hence, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `DatasetGroupBy` class to understand where it's defined and how it's implemented.\n2. Search for the `DataArrayGroupBy` class to compare its implementation with that of `DatasetGroupBy`, specifically looking at how the `quantile` method is implemented or inherited.\n3. Search for the `quantile` method within the `DatasetGroupBy` class to confirm its absence and better understand the context in which it should be implemented.\n4. Search for the `quantile` method within the `DataArrayGroupBy` class to see how it's implemented there since this might provide insights or a template for implementation in `DatasetGroupBy`.\n  \nLet's start with these searches:\n\n- search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")\n- search_class(\"DataArrayGroupBy\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArrayGroupBy\")"
