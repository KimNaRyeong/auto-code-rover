Given the constraints and requirements, below is a more direct and simpler `reproducer.py` Python script designed to reproduce the originally stated issue and use the provided function for printing a stack trace clearly:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_on_datasetgroupby():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        # Creating a simple dataset
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # This line should raise an AttributeError for DatasetGroupBy objects not implementing quantile
        quantile_result = ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0).quantile(0.5)
        # If the previous line did not raise an exception, the test fails
        raise AssertionError("DatasetGroupBy.quantile should not exist and raise an AttributeError.")

    except AttributeError as e:
        if "object has no attribute 'quantile'" in str(e):
            # Expected outcome, means issue is present
            print("Test failed as expected due to the issue.")
            exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 to indicate that the issue is reproduced successfully
        else:
            # If the AttributeError is for some other reason
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)

    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other unexpected exception and printing its stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_quantile_on_datasetgroupby()
```

This script thoroughly checks the specific issue at hand and adheres to your guidelines:
- It immediately attempts to execute the problematic instruction.
- If the assumed behavior (raising an `AttributeError` for calling `quantile` on a `DatasetGroupBy` object) is observed, it confirms the presence of the issue.
- If the attribute exists and no error is thrown, or if an unexpected error is caught, it will handle and report appropriately, utilizing the `print_stacktrace` function for clear visibility of the error context.
- The script exits with code 0 if the issue is successfully reproduced, indicating the script worked as intended for highlighting the problem.
