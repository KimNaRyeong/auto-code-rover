Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

This will likely help in implementing a configuration option or a new flag:\n   - `search_method(\"fail_under\")`\n\n2. Since the issue also suggests adding a new option like `--fail-on`, understanding how current command-line options are parsed and used is essential. This might be handled by a method or within a specific class responsible for CLI arguments or configurations:\n   - `search_code(\"argparse\")`\n   - `search_code(\"--fail-under\")`\n\n3.

        "content": "Based on the results returned from the API calls, here's an analysis focused on understanding the current state and determining the next steps towards resolving the issue:\n\n### Analyzing `argparse` Snippets\n- **Files Mentioned**:\n  - `pylint/checkers/refactoring/refactoring_checker.py`\n  - `examples/custom.py`\n  - `script/fix_documentation.py`\n- **Analysis**:\n  1. The mention of `argparse` in different files indicates places where command-line arguments are processed or examples/documentation related to it. However, only the `refactoring_checker.py` seems relevant to our issue, as it's directly part of the pylint checkers.\n  2. Considering the issue description, the failure handling mechanism (related to exit codes or the proposed `--fail-on` feature) might be intertwined with how pylint parses and handles command-line arguments, including `--fail-under`. \n  3. Intended Behavior: Modifications or additions to argument parsing that introduce the `--fail-on` functionality would need to integrate with this part of the code seamlessly, allowing users to specify certain error categories or issues that should always result in a failing exit code.\n\n### `--fail-under` Not Found\n- Given the direct search for `--fail-under` yielded no results, it's plausible that the specific handling of this functionality is abstracted or named differently within the codebase. Or possibly managed through a more generic configuration handling mechanism rather than explicitly named.\n\n### Exit Code Handling (`sys.exit`)\n- **Files Mentioned**:\n  - `pylint/lint/run.py` seems the most relevant, with a significant number of matches.\n- **Analysis**:\n  1. `sys.exit` being frequently called in `run.py` suggests this file contains the logic for determining exit codes based on linting outcomes. This makes it a key area of interest for implementing a change that affects exit codes.\n  2. The relationship is direct: we need to adjust or extend the decision-making process around `sys.exit` calls to account for the new `--fail-on` logic.\n  3. Intended Behavior: The code here should, after the patch, inspect the found issues against the user-defined `--fail-on` criteria (if provided) and decide on an exit code accordingly, potentially overriding other conditions if specified by the user.\n\n### Next Steps to Get More Context:\nGiven the insights above, the next steps should aim to pinpoint the exact implementation of `--fail-under` and better understand the linting results evaluation process that leads to an exit code decision. Specifically:\n\n1. **Investigate `run.py` for Exit Code Logic**:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"sys.exit\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")`\n   - This could help in identifying the block of code that determines when to exit with an error code.\n\n2. **Examine How Linting Results Are Processed**:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"linting result\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")`\n   - Understanding how pylint processes linting results (especially related to scoring and issue categorization) will be critical in integrating the `--fail-on` logic.\n\n3. **Further Investigate Command-line Argument Handling**:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"argparse\", \"pylint/checkers/refactoring/refactoring_checker.py\")`\n   - Since `--fail-under` was not directly found and `argparse` is involved in command-line argument processing, getting details from this checker file may provide insight into where and how `--fail-under` functionality is implemented or related command-line options are parsed.\n\nThese steps are designed to fill in the gaps from the initial search and refine our understanding of where and how to implement the requested `--fail-on` feature."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Since this is where `sys.exit` calls are concentrated, this file will be the primary location for integrating the `--fail-on` functionality.\n\n**Intended Behavior at Bug Location**:\n- Within `run.py`, the modification should firstly introduce the capability to parse and understand the new `--fail-on` command-line argument. This requires extending the `argparse` logic to accept `--fail-on` and processing it to filter specific issue types or codes as specified by the user.\n- Secondly, after the linting process concludes, before deciding on the exit code based on the `--fail-under` score threshold, the code should evaluate whether any of the issues detected match the criteria defined by `--fail-on`. If any issues match, regardless of the linting score, an error exit code should be returned.\n- This behavior must preserve existing functionality, such as `--fail-under`, while adding the new conditional fail logic. It should act as an additional layer of condition that, if met, precedes other considerations for determining the exit code.\n- Adding support for the `--fail-on` option will involve not only parsing the option but also adjusting the linting result evaluation process. The evaluation should maintain its original function, where it exits with an error code if the score is under the specified threshold while also incorporating the new logic to check for specific issue types or codes and fail if they are present, regardless of the score.\n\nThis approach ensures that the tool remains backward compatible for users who do not utilize the new `--fail-on` feature while providing enhanced functionality for those who need more granular control over the failure conditions of their linting process in CI environments."
