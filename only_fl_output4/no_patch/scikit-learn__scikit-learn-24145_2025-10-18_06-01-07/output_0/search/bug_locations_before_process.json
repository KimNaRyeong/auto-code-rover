        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to support an additional optional parameter (`sparse`: `bool`, default=`False`) that, when set to `True`, enables the method to return a sparse matrix output instead of a dense ndarray. This involves:\n- Introducing logic to conditionally construct and populate a sparse matrix (`scipy.sparse`) based on the transformed spline features. This might involve initializing a sparse matrix before the loop that iterates over each feature, and then, within the loop, rather than directly modifying a dense array, updating the sparse matrix with non-zero values calculated during the transformation.\n- Ensuring that all current extrapolation handling (`continue`, `error`, `periodic`, `constant`, `linear`) is compatible with sparse matrix output. This may require implementing equivalent logic that applies to the construction of the sparse matrix.\n- Preserving the existing functionality and performance when `sparse=False`, maintaining backward compatibility for existing users of the `SplineTransformer`.\n- Additional parameters for controlling the sparse matrix format could be considered to provide flexibility to the user. However, the simplest implementation would involve choosing a sensible default sparse format (e.g., CSR or CSC) that balances memory efficiency with the performance of subsequent operations likely performed on the output."
