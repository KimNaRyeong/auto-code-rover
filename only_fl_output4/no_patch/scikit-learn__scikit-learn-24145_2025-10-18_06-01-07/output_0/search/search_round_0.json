        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about adding a sparse matrix output option to the `SplineTransformer` in a codebase that likely belongs to the `scikit-learn` project, I will use the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SplineTransformer\")`: This call will help locate the `SplineTransformer` class within the project. The goal is to understand in which file(s) the class is defined and start gathering context around its implementation.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"SplineTransformer\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions altering the behavior of the `fit_transform` method to optionally return a sparse matrix, this call will provide details on how `fit_transform` is currently implemented in the `SplineTransformer` class. \n\n3. `search_code(\"design_matrix\")`: The issue suggests using `design_matrix` from a pull request in the `scipy` repository for scipy >= 1.8. This call will help locate if there are any current usages or references to `design_matrix` that must be considered or could serve as a guide for the proposed feature."
