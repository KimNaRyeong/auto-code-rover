Add sparse matrix output to SplineTransformer
### Describe the workflow you want to enable

As B-splines naturally have a sparse structure, I'd like to have the option that `SplineTransformer` returns a sparse matrix instead of always an ndarray.
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer

X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)
spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)
spline.fit_transform(X)
```

### Describe your proposed solution

With scipy >= 1.8 (yet to be released), we can use `design_matrix` from https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14344.
