This is a problem, for example, when you try to save a model object, and a decimal field got set to a dictionary by mistake. The TypeError exception that comes back makes it hard to track the problem to the field if the object has a lot of fields.\nI am proposing a patch to fix it:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/13023\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue properly, we will need to gather more information about the `DecimalField` class, its method `to_python()`, and how validation is currently handled within this class. Therefore, we should focus our API calls on retrieving the relevant parts of the codebase that are directly related to this issue. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `DecimalField` class to understand its structure and current validation mechanisms.\n2. Search for the `to_python` method within the `DecimalField` class to see how it's currently implemented and possibly why it's raising a `TypeError` when it receives a dictionary as input.\n3. Since the issue mentions a problem related to raising `TypeError` instead of `ValidationError`, we should also gather context on how validation errors are typically raised within this codebase. Searching for a common validation exception handler or a method that raises `ValidationError` might give insight into the expected way to handle invalid inputs.\n\nTherefore, the required API calls are:\n\n- `search_class(\"DecimalField\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DecimalField\")`\n- `search_code(\"ValidationError\")`"
