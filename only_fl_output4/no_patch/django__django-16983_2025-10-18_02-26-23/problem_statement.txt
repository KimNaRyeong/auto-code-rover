Add system check for filter_horizontal/filter_vertical on ManyToManyFields with intermediary models.
Description
	
Hi team,
I'm a huge fan of Django and have been using it since 0.95 but I stumbled over this one.
Neither of
​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal and 
​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_vertical
call out the requirement to not use 
ManyToManyField(through="")
In the same way:
​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through
doesn't call out the consequence that filter_horizontal and filter_vertical will stop working if one goes down the pathway of:
ManyToManyField(through="")
I just wasted half a day chasing this down.
