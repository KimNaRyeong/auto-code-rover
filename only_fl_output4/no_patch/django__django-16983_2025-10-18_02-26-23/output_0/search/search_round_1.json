        "content": "To address the issue regarding the use of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in `ManyToManyField` with an intermediary model (`through=\"\"`), I'll retrieve related code context through specific API calls. My goal is to gather enough information to understand where and how to apply the fix. Here are the calls:\n\n1. Search for the `ModelAdmin` class where `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are properties:\n   - `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n2. Search for mentions or uses of `ManyToManyField` across the codebase, focusing on the instantiation that includes the `through` argument:\n   - `search_code(\"ManyToManyField(through=\")`\n\n3. Since `ManyToManyField` is likely defined within Django's models module, and the issue revolves around its interaction with admin options (`filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`), I'll also search for `ManyToManyField` within the models context:\n   - `search_method(\"ManyToManyField\")`\n\n4. Additionally, understanding how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are checked or processed could be crucial. Therefore, I will search for methods or code snippets where these properties are accessed or manipulated, starting with a broader search:\n   - `search_code(\"filter_horizontal\")`\n   - `search_code(\"filter_vertical\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how `ManyToManyField` relations are defined, specifically those with custom through models, and how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` properties are handled in the Django Admin. This context will guide the development of a system check to catch this misconfiguration."

It includes configurations such as `list_display`, `search_fields`, and importantly for this issue, it seems to be the place where `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` should be defined or manipulated.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Since `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are used within the `ModelAdmin` class to customize the admin interface, and the bug is about `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` not working as expected with `ManyToManyField` through models, the implementation or checks related to these options in this class are directly relevant.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, when either `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is used in conjunction with a `ManyToManyField` that specifies a `through` model, there should be a system check that either warns or prevents this configuration due to the limitations described in the bug report.\n\n### Search Results for `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`\n- **What it does**: The search results pointing to `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py` for `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` suggest that there are already implementations or checks concerning these attributes. The references in `checks.py` could indicate that system checks for these configurations are performed here.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Given that the bug involves a lack of checks or warnings for a specific `ManyToManyField` configuration, the relevant code in these files could be where the logic needs to be added or modified to introduce the necessary system checks.\n- **Intended behavior**: The system should ideally perform a check when `ManyToManyField` is used with a `through` model along with `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`, and inform the user that this configuration is unsupported or that it might not work as intended.\n\n### Action Steps\nConsidering the absence of direct references to `ManyToManyField(through=` and the method `ManyToManyField` not being found, it may be necessary to:\n1. Explore `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` to understand the current system checks related to `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`. This could involve checking if there's a mechanism in place for validating field configurations that could be extended to cover this scenario.\n2. Analyze the handling and definition of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, considering how these options are validated against the model fields to ensure they reference valid field names and checking if there\u2019s a pathway in the logic that could incorporate checking for `ManyToManyField` with a `through` model.\n3. Since a direct search for `ManyToManyField(through=` and the method `ManyToManyField` didn't return results, consider more generic searches around `ManyToManyField` usage in admin classes or checks for field configurations in admin classes, possibly by searching across `django/contrib/admin/` for `ManyToManyField` usage.\n\nNext steps for API calls could involve:\n1. `search_code_in_file(code_str: \"ManyToManyField\", file_path: \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")` - to see if `ManyToManyField` is indirectly referred to or used.\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"filter_horizontal\", \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\")` and `search_code_in_file(\"filter_vertical\", \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\")` - to pinpoint the implementation of checks that validate `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` configurations, which could be extended to include our case."

This system check function would iterate through the model fields, identifying any `ManyToManyField` with a custom `through` model and check if `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is being used for such fields. If found, it should raise a warning or error, indicating that this configuration is not supported.\n  \n- **Location 2: File: django/contrib/admin/options.py, Class: ModelAdmin**\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Although no direct changes might be needed in the `ModelAdmin` class based on the current context, enhancing the documentation or inline comments to clearly state that `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` cannot be used with `ManyToManyField` instances that specify a `through` model could improve developer experience and clarity. If the system check is implemented as suggested above, a reference to this check could also be included here as part of the documentation."
