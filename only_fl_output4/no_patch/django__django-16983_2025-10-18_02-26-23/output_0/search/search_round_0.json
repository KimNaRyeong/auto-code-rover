        "content": "To address the issue regarding the use of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in `ManyToManyField` with an intermediary model (`through=\"\"`), I'll retrieve related code context through specific API calls. My goal is to gather enough information to understand where and how to apply the fix. Here are the calls:\n\n1. Search for the `ModelAdmin` class where `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are properties:\n   - `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n2. Search for mentions or uses of `ManyToManyField` across the codebase, focusing on the instantiation that includes the `through` argument:\n   - `search_code(\"ManyToManyField(through=\")`\n\n3. Since `ManyToManyField` is likely defined within Django's models module, and the issue revolves around its interaction with admin options (`filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`), I'll also search for `ManyToManyField` within the models context:\n   - `search_method(\"ManyToManyField\")`\n\n4. Additionally, understanding how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are checked or processed could be crucial. Therefore, I will search for methods or code snippets where these properties are accessed or manipulated, starting with a broader search:\n   - `search_code(\"filter_horizontal\")`\n   - `search_code(\"filter_vertical\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how `ManyToManyField` relations are defined, specifically those with custom through models, and how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` properties are handled in the Django Admin. This context will guide the development of a system check to catch this misconfiguration."
