Based on your request, below is a version of `reproducer.py` that specifically targets the issue of parsing LaTeX fractions with SymPy. The script will attempt to parse a given LaTeX expression and compare the output against the expected result. If the parsing output does not match the expected result, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    # The problematic latex expression given
    latex = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
    try:
        # Parsing the given latex expression
        result = parse_latex(latex)
        # Expected result after parsing
        expected = "((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))"
        # Converting sympy expression to string for comparison
        result_str = str(result)

        # Check if the current parsing matches the expected result
        assert result_str == expected, f"Expected: {expected}, got: {result_str}"
        print("Test passed: The parsing result matches the expected output.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise the AssertionError after printing stack trace

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed
    except Exception as e:
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure
```
This script checks for the specific parsing issue related to LaTeX fraction expressions in SymPy. If the parsed output does not match the expected structure due to missing brackets around the denominator of the fraction, it will identify this discrepancy as a failure, print the stack trace for debugging purposes, and exit with code 1, indicating an error condition caused by the presence of the issue. If the output is as expected, it will instead exit with code 0, reflecting successful resolution or absence of the issue.
