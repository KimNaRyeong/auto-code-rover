Given the feedback, it's clear that the previous script failed primarily because the necessary antlr4 package was not installed, which is vital for parsing LaTeX with SymPy. This time, to accurately capture and raise an `AssertionError` on the issue without external package dependency errors obstructing execution, let's adjust the approach slightly.

This revised version includes a preliminary check for dependencies, specifically aiming to ensure that the `antlr4` package is installed, before proceeding with reproducing the issue. This way, if there's a failure related to missing packages, it can be addressed directly and won't mistakenly be interpreted as the parsing issue we are trying to reproduce.

```python
# reproducer.py

def check_dependencies():
    try:
        import antlr4
    except ImportError:
        raise ImportError("This script requires the antlr4 package. Install it via pip using 'pip install antlr4-python3-runtime'.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Ensure required dependencies are installed
        check_dependencies()

        from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex

        # Given problematic latex expression
        latex_expr = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
        # Parse the latex expression
        parsed_expr = parse_latex(latex_expr)

        # Convert the parsed expression to string for easier comparison
        parsed_expr_str = str(parsed_expr)

        # Expected string representation of the parsed expression
        expected_expr_str = '((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))'

        # Check if the parsed expression matches the expected expression
        assert parsed_expr_str == expected_expr_str, "Parsed expression does not match the expected output"

        print("Issue not found, parsed expression matches the expected output.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to assertion error
    except ImportError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(2)  # Exit with code 2 to indicate missing dependencies

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running this script as `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project should first ensure that necessary dependencies are available. If the `antlr4` package is missing, it informs the user directly instead of failing obscurely. This approach maintains the intended focus on diagnosing the specific LaTeX parsing issue.
