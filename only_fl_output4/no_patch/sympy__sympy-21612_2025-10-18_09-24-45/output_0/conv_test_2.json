This time, to accurately capture and raise an `AssertionError` on the issue without external package dependency errors obstructing execution, let's adjust the approach slightly.\n\nThis revised version includes a preliminary check for dependencies, specifically aiming to ensure that the `antlr4` package is installed, before proceeding with reproducing the issue. This way, if there's a failure related to missing packages, it can be addressed directly and won't mistakenly be interpreted as the parsing issue we are trying to reproduce.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef check_dependencies():\n    try:\n        import antlr4\n    except ImportError:\n        raise ImportError(\"This script requires the antlr4 package.

If the `antlr4` package is missing, it informs the user directly instead of failing obscurely. This approach maintains the intended focus on diagnosing the specific LaTeX parsing issue."
