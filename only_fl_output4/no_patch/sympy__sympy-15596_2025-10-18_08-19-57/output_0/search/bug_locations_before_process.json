        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `degree` method should be enhanced to explicitly handle the case of rational functions. This involves detecting when the input `f` represents a rational function and then computing its degree by taking the difference between the degrees of its numerator and denominator. This process might involve utilizing or extending existing functions to separate the numerator and denominator in a rational function expression, compute their degrees separately, and then return the difference as the final degree of the rational function. Such an enhancement should not affect the method's current capability to handle non-rational-function inputs, thereby preserving its existing functionality while effectively addressing the issue with rational function degree computation. This improvement ensures that when users query the degree of a rational function, they receive a mathematically accurate response, thereby closing the gap identified in the submitted issue."
