This identifies a potential gap in testing or documentation for the handling of rational functions by the `degree` method.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the gap in explicit examples or test cases for this issue, and the identification of relevant files, the following steps are required to gain more context and move towards a solution:\n\n1. **Examine Implementation**: We should delve into the implementation of the `degree` method in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` since this is most likely where the handling (or mishandling) of rational functions takes place. This would involve:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"degree\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")`: To get specific context on how `degree` is implemented here.\n\n2. **Consider Related Utilities**: Given that rational functions are involved, looking into how SymPy represents and manipulates these might reveal why the `degree` method returns an unexpected result. Understanding the classes used to represent polynomials and rational functions might provide insight:\n   - `search_class(\"RationalFunction\")`: To check if a specific class exists for rational functions.\n   - If no specific class is found, we should then examine how polynomials and their operations are defined, needing possibly:\n     - `search_class_in_file(\"Poly\", \"sympy/polys/polyclasses.py\")`: To understand if the degree calculation indirectly related to the `Poly` class behavior.\n\nThese steps aim to map out how the `degree` function processes its inputs, especially in cases involving rational functions, towards pinpointing the discrepancy between expected and actual behavior as specified in the issue."

For rational functions (expressions of the form numerator/denominator), the degree should be calculated as the degree of the numerator minus the degree of the denominator. This calculation must correctly handle cases where the numerator and the denominator are both polynomials, potentially returning a negative degree if the denominator has a higher degree than the numerator. Additionally, the function should perform checks to reliably identify rational functions and handle them appropriately, either directly within `degree` or through auxiliary functions designed to manage rational expressions. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality of handling pure polynomial inputs while extending the method to correctly deal with rational function inputs."
