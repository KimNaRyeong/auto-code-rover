        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should start by understanding where the `runserver` command is implemented within Django's management command system. We'll also need to investigate how system checks are integrated into the `runserver` command flow.\n\nGiven the context, the following API calls can help us gather the necessary details:\n\n1. Search for the `runserver` command class implementation, as it's likely encapsulated in a class that handles this specific command.\n2. Locate where system checks are called in the `runserver` command flow to see how we can introduce a flag to skip these checks.\n\nTherefore, the relevant API calls could be:\n\n- `search_class(\"Command\")`: Since Django's management commands often inherit from a base `Command` class, but this might return a lot of results, narrowing it down to the `runserver` command is crucial.\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`: This method might directly lead us to the implementation of the `runserver` command or related functionality.\n- `search_code(\"class Command\")`: This can help us locate classes named Command, which might include the `runserver` command if the previous method doesn't yield direct results.\n- `search_code(\"def handle\")`: Since the `handle` method is typically what Django management commands use to execute their logic, this could lead us to the implementation of the `runserver` command functionality, where system checks are likely invoked.\n\nLet's execute these API calls to gather necessary code context:\n\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`\n- `search_code(\"class Command\")`\n- `search_code(\"def handle\")`"
