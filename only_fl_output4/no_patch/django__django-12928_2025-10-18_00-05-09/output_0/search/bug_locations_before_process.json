        "intended_behavior": "Modify this method to implement caching that checks the last modified time of template files when `DEBUG` is `True` and an `autoreload` option is enabled within the `TEMPLATES` settings. If the template has been modified since it was last cached, the method should invalidate the current cache entry, reload the template from the file system, cache this newly loaded version, and return it. This mechanism preserves the existing functionality by maintaining caching benefits but adds developing convenience with auto-reloading capabilities. The caching logic should be bypassed or operate differently when `DEBUG` is `False` to ensure production environments do not incur unnecessary file system checks, adhering to performance best practices. This enhancement will require careful consideration of performance implications to ensure that the development convenience does not lead to significant degradation in template rendering performance during development."
