It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

It provides methods to load templates, compile them from strings, and fetch template tag libraries.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This class is critical since the issue involves enhancing the Django template loading process with caching and auto-reload capabilities. The `get_template` method, in particular, could be directly relevant for implementing a caching mechanism that supports auto-reloading.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Given the issue, we would expect some mechanism in this class (or related to it) that allows for the caching of templates and their automatic reloading when changes are detected, especially in development mode (`DEBUG` = True).\n\n2. **DjangoTemplates Class in django/forms/renderers.py:**\n   - **What it does:** This class seems to be a specialized form rendering engine, utilizing the DjangoTemplates backend.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This class indirectly relates to the issue since it uses Django's template engine for rendering forms. Modifications in the DjangoTemplates backend may affect form rendering, but it's less likely the primary target for our solution.\n   - **Intended behavior:** This class would benefit from the improved template loading (with caching and auto-reload) if it uses the main DjangoTemplates backend for form rendering, improving developer experience without direct changes required here.\n\n### Insights:\n- The absence of direct references to `'cached template loader'`, `'cache_templates'`, and `'autoreload'` indicates that these options might not be implemented yet or are referred to differently within the codebase.\n- The issue suggests these are new features or enhancements based on a specific patch.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince the specific terms didn\u2019t return results, we might need to look into related concepts within Django's templating system that allow for similar behaviors or the mechanisms Django uses for its `DEBUG` mode auto-reloading features.\n\n1. **Investigate Template Loading Mechanism:**\n   - To understand how the template loading mechanism works and explore existing caching functionalities, we can dig deeper into methods within the DjangoTemplates class, especially the `get_template` method.\n\n2. **Explore DEBUG Mode Mechanisms:**\n   - Understanding how Django detects changes and reloads in `DEBUG` mode might give clues on implementing a similar approach for template loading. This might not directly relate to a specific class or method but to the Django framework's reloading utilities.\n\nBased on these insights, the following API calls seem pertinent:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_template\", \"DjangoTemplates\")`: To get more details on the template loading method.\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG\")`: To find how `DEBUG` mode is checked or used throughout the project, which could lead us to auto-reloading mechanisms."

The intended behavior is to check if the `DEBUG` mode is enabled and if the `autoreload` option is set to True. In such a case, the method should verify if the template has been modified since the last load. If modified, it should reload and recompile the template, caching this latest version. This behavior allows for the speed benefits of caching while developing, by eliminating the need to restart the server for every template change.\n\n**Note:** Since no direct references to the caching mechanism (`'cache_templates'` and `'autoreload'`) were found in the codebase from the provided search results, the implementation details are assumed based on the description of the issue and common practices for such features.

        "content": "### Analysis:\n\n#### `get_template` Method in DjangoTemplates Class:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `get_template` method retrieves a template by its name. It attempts to fetch the specified template and wraps it in a `Template` object that is returned for use. If the template does not exist, it raises a `TemplateDoesNotExist` exception.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method is crucial for implementing the requested feature. The issue requires the `get_template` method to support caching templates for fast retrieval while also reloading them if they have been changed when `DEBUG` is true. The current implementation does not consider caching or checking modification timestamps to auto-reload templates.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to modify the `get_template` method to incorporate a caching layer which respects the `DEBUG` and possibly a new `autoreload` configuration. When caching is enabled (`cache_templates` is true), and `autoreload` is also true (which should rely on `DEBUG` mode), the method should check if a cached version of the template exists and is up to date. If the template was modified since caching, the method should invalidate the cache entry for that template, reload the template from disk, cache the new version, and return it.\n\n#### DEBUG Usage in the Codebase:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - Usage of `DEBUG` across the codebase likely controls various development-time features, such as detailed error reporting, static files serving by Django in development, and possibly dynamic reloading of code. It's a flag that, when set to `True`, enables features and behaviors intended to aid development and debugging.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `DEBUG` setting's usage is directly related to the condition under which the new `autoreload` feature should be active according to the issue description. Our implementation needs to consider how `DEBUG` is used throughout Django to appropriately integrate the autoreload logic in a way that is consistent with other development-focused features of Django.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - While the search for `DEBUG` returned many instances, the intended behavior related to our issue is that whenever `DEBUG` is set to true (and `autoreload` is explicitly set to true within the template's backend options), the cache mechanism for templates should adapt by incorporating a check for updated template files before serving a cached version. This ensures developers do not need to restart their server after each template modification, improving the development workflow. \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo address the issue, the main focus is on enhancing the `get_template` function within the `DjangoTemplates` class to support a development-friendly autoreload mechanism. This enhancement hinges on utilizing the `DEBUG` setting to inform when this behavior should be engaged. The precise implementation will require a design that can efficiently check for template modifications without significantly impacting the performance benefits provided by template caching in production environments (`DEBUG=False`)."

If the template has been modified since it was last cached, the method should invalidate the current cache entry, reload the template from the file system, cache this newly loaded version, and return it. This mechanism preserves the existing functionality by maintaining caching benefits but adds developing convenience with auto-reloading capabilities. The caching logic should be bypassed or operate differently when `DEBUG` is `False` to ensure production environments do not incur unnecessary file system checks, adhering to performance best practices. This enhancement will require careful consideration of performance implications to ensure that the development convenience does not lead to significant degradation in template rendering performance during development."
