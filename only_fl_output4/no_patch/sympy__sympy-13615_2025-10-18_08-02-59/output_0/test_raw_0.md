Certainly, below is the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the described issue. It attempts to complement a finite set containing both symbols and a number with an interval, and raises an `AssertionError` if the output does not match the expected result:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, FiniteSet, Interval, Complement

    x, y = Symbol('x'), Symbol('y')  # Define symbols
    a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
    b = Interval(-10, 10)
    result = Complement(a, b)

    # Here we check if the issue is present. Since the expected result is not purely {x, y}
    # but rather {x, y} \ [-10,10], we assert for incorrect behavior.
    try:
        assert str(result) == "{x, y} \\ [-10, 10]", "Issue detected: Complement does not work as expected with mixture of Symbols and numbers."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please make sure you have `sympy` installed in your environment before running this script. You can install it using `pip install sympy` if you haven't done so already.

Upon execution, this script:
- Imports necessary components from `sympy`.
- Defines symbols and sets, as per the issue description.
- Performs the complement operation between the defined set and interval.
- Asserts the result against the expected output, which according to the issue, is specifically `{x, y} \ [-10, 10]`.
- If the assertion fails (indicating the presence of the issue), it captures and prints the stack trace, highlighting the line in the script where the issue was detected.

Since the output from Sympy may not directly format to "{x, y} \\ [-10, 10]", the assertion might need to be adjusted based on the actual correct behavior or the format of the expression Sympy returns upon resolution of this issue.
