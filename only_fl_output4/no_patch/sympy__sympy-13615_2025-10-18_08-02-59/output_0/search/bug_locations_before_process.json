        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to ensure that when computing the complement of a `FiniteSet` against an `Interval`, numerical elements within the `FiniteSet` that fall within the bounds of the `Interval` are correctly excluded from the result. Symbolic elements, as well as numerical elements outside the `Interval`'s range, should remain unaffected. This change aims to fix the incorrect behavior when inputs contain a mix of symbols and numbers, ensuring that the output correctly reflects the mathematical set operation `{x, y} \\ [-10,10]`, as described in the issue. The modification should retain existing functionality for all other cases, ensuring that no regressions are introduced for complements involving other types of sets or under different conditions."
