Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Colorbar `__init__` Method Context\n\nThe code snippet from `colorbar.py` in the `__init__` method shows how the colorbar handles its formatter based on whether the `format` parameter is a string. If it is a string, it uses `ticker.FormatStrFormatter`. This is part of the current behavior the issue describes as using \"old style\" format strings.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The issue suggests moving away from this explicit handling of string formats in the colorbar initialization to rely instead on the default logic found in the `Axis` class, which was updated to accommodate new style format strings in a previous change (referenced as #16715 in the issue). This would align the behavior of colorbar formatting with axis formatting, making it consistent across matplotlib.\n\n#### 2. `update_ticks` Method in `colorbar.py`\n\nThis method updates the ticks and ticklabels for the colorbar. It explicitly sets the major formatter of the colorbar's long axis to `self.formatter`, which is determined in the `__init__` method as noted above. \n\n**Intended Behavior:** The proposed solution suggests that by making changes to how formatters are handled (potentially removing the explicit string formatter handling in `__init__`), the colorbar could inherit improvements made to formatting handling in the `Axis` class without duplicating logic or maintaining separate pathways for formatting logic.\n\n#### 3. `_set_formatter` Method in `Axis` Class\n\nThis method demonstrates how an `Axis` object handles its formatter. If the formatter is a string, it's converted to `mticker.StrMethodFormatter`, which supports new style format strings. This is a more flexible and modern approach than what's currently used in the colorbar `__init__`, where old style `%` format strings are instantiated explicitly.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Given the issue's goal to standardize the use of new style format strings across matplotlib objects, aligning the colorbar's format handling with the `Axis` class's approach seems like a direct solution. This would likely involve adjustments to ensure the colorbar can correctly leverage the `StrMethodFormatter` for string formats or potentially even direct callables as formatters, which the issue mentions as currently undocumented behavior.\n\n#### 4. Search for \"callable directly\"\n\nThe lack of results for \"callable directly\" indicates either that the usage of a callable as a formatter directly is rare, undocumented, and potentially not officially supported, or that the specific phrase used in the search query does not match how this functionality is referenced or implemented in the codebase.\n\n**Further Steps:** To better understand how or if callables are directly used as formatters, we might need to look closer into how formatters are set or applied across different parts of matplotlib, particularly in relation to the `Axis` class or in examples/documentation if the internal code search doesn't yield results. Moreover, exploring the documentation or user guide sections that detail custom formatter logic might provide insights into this undocumented feature mentioned in the issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe enhancement requires a deeper understanding of how matplotlib's formatting logic operates across different components, especially focusing on the standardization towards new style format strings. The proposed changes would require careful consideration of backward compatibility and how users currently interact with formatter customization. This suggests that a deprecation cycle, as hinted at in the issue, along with clear documentation updates, would be necessary steps in implementing this enhancement to ensure a smooth transition for matplotlib users."

Instead, it should leverage the updated logic in the `Axis` class, allowing for a consistent use of new style format strings. The handling for if `format` is a callable or `None` should remain as is to preserve backward compatibility and existing functionality.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`\n  - **Class:** `Colorbar`\n  - **Method:** N/A (General behavior)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that the colorbar can seamlessly integrate with the `Axis` class's format handling mechanisms, especially concerning `_set_formatter` in `axis.py`. This integration should support both new style format strings and direct callables as formatters, aligning with the `Axis` class's capabilities and the enhancements from #16715. Additionally, documentation or helper comments might need to be updated to reflect this new approach and guide users away from outdated formatting conventions towards the new standard.\n\nThese changes aim to standardize formatting across matplotlib, reduce redundancy, and embrace Python's newer formatting capabilities for better consistency and usability within the library."
