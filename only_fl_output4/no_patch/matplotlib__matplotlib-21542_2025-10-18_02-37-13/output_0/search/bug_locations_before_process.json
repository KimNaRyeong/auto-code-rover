Instead, it should leverage the updated logic in the `Axis` class, allowing for a consistent use of new style format strings. The handling for if `format` is a callable or `None` should remain as is to preserve backward compatibility and existing functionality."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the colorbar can seamlessly integrate with the `Axis` class's format handling mechanisms, especially concerning `_set_formatter` in `axis.py`. This integration should support both new style format strings and direct callables as formatters, aligning with the `Axis` class's capabilities and the enhancements from #16715. Additionally, documentation or helper comments might need to be updated to reflect this new approach and guide users away from outdated formatting conventions towards the new standard."
