        "method": "relplot",
        "intended_behavior": "The `relplot` function should include additional logic or adjustments to the layout to prevent overlapping labels, especially in scenarios where axis sharing (`sharex`, `sharey`) and label formatting (`ticklabel_format`) are involved. This may involve dynamically adjusting spacing between facets or altering label orientation based on the facet dimensions and content. The functionality for plotting relations in data through scatter and line plots must remain unaffected, preserving user options for customizing plots while enhancing label legibility."

        "intended_behavior": "The `set_titles` method should include smarter handling of title placement and size calculations, particularly for longer titles or when using scientific notation that increases the risk of overlap. It could benefit from dynamically adjusting title positions based on the adjacent axis labels' extent and the overall plot layout configurations. The method must continue to offer flexible title customization, supporting different formats while intuitively minimizing content overlap across facets."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly mentioned as buggy, enhancing the `add_legend` strategy to include considerations for axis label adjustments could offer a more comprehensive solution. Integrating the dynamic layout adjustments seen in `add_legend` (for accommodating legends) with methods controlling axis label and title formatting could mitigate overlap issues. This approach should ensure that legends, axis labels, and titles harmoniously coexist within seaborn's plots without requiring manual adjustments from the user."
