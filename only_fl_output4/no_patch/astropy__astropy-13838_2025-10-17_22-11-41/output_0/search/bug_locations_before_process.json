        "intended_behavior": "The `_pformat_table` method should be scrutinized for how it handles columns with 0-length arrays. The enhancement needed is to ensure it does not throw an `IndexError` when encountering such a scenario. Instead, it should gracefully handle these cases, perhaps by showing an appropriate placeholder (e.g., an empty string or a special marker indicating no data) for empty arrays. This will require carefully handling empty arrays during width calculations and row formation, ensuring they do not trigger index out-of-bound errors when their contents (or lack thereof) are processed."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to precisely handle the case of 0-length arrays within columns. When formatting column data for display, the method must check for the length of the array and, if found to be zero, it should adapt its output accordingly to avoid accessing elements that do not exist. The intended behavior here is to allow for a representation of empty arrays in the formatted output that does not mislead the viewer but accurately reflects the state of the data (e.g., \"[]\" or a similar indication of emptiness)."
