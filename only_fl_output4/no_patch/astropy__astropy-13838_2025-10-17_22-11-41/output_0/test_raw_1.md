Given the clarification needed for creating a standalone script and the previous misunderstanding regarding the execution environment, I will provide an updated version of `reproducer.py`. This version will include necessary checks to confirm the presence of the issue outlined in your report.

```python
"""
Standalone script to reproduce an issue with Astropy's QTable

try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.table import QTable
except ImportError as import_error:
    raise SystemExit("This script requires numpy and astropy to be installed.") from import_error

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"

        print("No issue detected; the expected behavior is achieved.")
    except IndexError as e:
        # If an IndexError occurred, print the stack trace and indicate the issue presence
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
    except Exception as e:

This script is designed to be run in an environment where both **numpy** and **astropy** are installed, as they are essential for reproducing the issue with Astropy's `QTable`. The script follows a pattern to ensure it can be executed standalone:

1. **Import Check**: It verifies that **numpy** and **astropy** are available; otherwise, it ends gracefully, indicating that these packages must be installed.
2. **Print Stack Trace Function**: Utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed error information if an exception is caught.
3. **Main Functionality**: Attempts to reproduce the error by creating a `QTable` object with rows that include 0-length array cells. If creating or printing this table does not result in an `IndexError`, the script assumes that the issue may no longer be present and ends without raising an assertion.
4. **Error Handling**: If an `IndexError` occurs during table creation or printing, it prints the stack trace and raises an `AssertionError` indicating the issue persists. It captures any unexpected exceptions, prints their stack trace, and proceeds without failing, which ensures that only the specific issue being tested causes an assertion failure.

This script will exit with a non-zero status code if an `AssertionError` is thrown, indicative of the issue's presence. Otherwise, successful execution (including handling of any other types of exceptions without failing) will result in an exit code of 0, suggesting the issue might be fixed or not reproduced in the current environment.
