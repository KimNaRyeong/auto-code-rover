Based on the provided details and requirements, below is a crafted standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) designed to reproduce the issue as described, including using the `print_stacktrace` function for clear error tracing. This script will attempt to create and print an `astropy.table.QTable` with rows that include 0-length array cells, mimicking the issue scenario you've encountered.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import QTable

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


events = [
    {"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
    {"A": 1, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
    {"A": 2, "B": 2, "C": np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.uint64)}
]

try:
    # Attempt to create and print the table which should raise the issue
    table = QTable(rows=events[:2])
    print(table)
    # If table prints without error, the issue is assumed to be resolved
    print("No issue detected. The expected behavior is achieved.")
except IndexError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
except Exception as e:
    # Catch all other exceptions to make sure they are properly logged
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.") from e
```

This script specifically targets the issue scenario described, where attempting to print a table with 0-length array cells results in an `IndexError`. By including various checks and a detailed stack trace output for errors, the script ensures clarity in reproducing the issue and aids in understanding the cause when the error is present.

When you run `python3 reproducer.py` within your project's root directory, the behavior will follow as such:

- **If the issue is present**, the script will catch the `IndexError` triggered during table creation or printing, print a detailed stack trace, and raise an `AssertionError` indicating the presence of the issue.
- **If the issue is resolved or not present**, the script will successfully print the table or catch and log an unexpected error type, potentially indicating that the specific `IndexError` issue has been addressed.

The final behavior (i.e., whether the script exits with code 0 for a fixed issue or raises an assertion error when the issue is detected) helps in automated testing environments where the presence or absence of specific issues needs to be validated programmatically.
