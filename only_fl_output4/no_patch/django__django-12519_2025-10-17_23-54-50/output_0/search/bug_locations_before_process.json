Specifically, it may need adjustments to handle complex annotations that impact distinctness based on the changes or differences observed between Django versions. The correction should ensure that the dynamic nature of query construction reflects all necessary annotations, without adversely affecting other parts of the ORM's functionality, particularly in how non-aggregate and aggregate fields are processed."

This might involve refining the resolution process or how these resolved annotations are tracked within the query structure to support correct group by clause construction. The method should explicitly consider the effects of subquery annotations on the group by logic, ensuring these are neither omitted nor incorrectly handled, which could lead to results differing from expected distinctness."
