My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to find out how the `iter_content` method is implemented and how it differs from accessing the `.text` property in terms of handling Unicode. Since the issue mentions using the `requests` library, we're specifically interested in the implementation details within this library. We will look for the `Response` class where both `iter_content` and `.text` are likely defined or used.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `Response` class, and then look for the `iter_content` method and the `.text` property within the context of `requests`. We need to understand the handling of `decode_unicode` within `iter_content` and how the `.text` property gets its Unicode result. \n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Response\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"iter_content\", \"Response\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"text\", \"Response\")\n```"
