Specifically, the issue mentioned involves unicode indices being cast to object dtype on deep copy, which points towards sections of the code handling the copying of data structures or the management of dtypes.\n\nHere's how we can proceed with the search API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `Dataset` class to understand its structure and how copying is implemented.\n2. Search for the `DataArray` class because the issue affects both `Dataset` and `DataArray`.\n3. Look for the `copy` method within both classes, as the issue specifically mentions a regression with `deep=True` argument.\n4. Given the nature of the problem involves dtype conversion, it may also be useful to look for any utility functions or relevant code snippets that handle dtype, especially focusing on conversions or checks related to `'<U*'` dtypes or casting to `object`.\n\nGiven these points, the API calls might include:\n\n- `search_class(\"Dataset\")`\n- `search_class(\"DataArray\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Dataset\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"DataArray\")`\n- `search_code(\"dtype='<U*'\")`\n- `search_code(\"dtype='object'\")`\n\nExecuting these searches should provide a comprehensive context for addressing the issue."
