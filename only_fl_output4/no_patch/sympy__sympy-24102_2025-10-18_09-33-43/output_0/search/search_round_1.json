This function supports both the standard input form and Mathematica full form. When it encounters translations that don't map directly to existing SymPy expressions, it resorts to creating an expression that is equivalent to Mathematica's \"FullForm,\" leveraging SymPy `Function` objects to construct the syntax tree.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe bug report indicates that `parse_mathematica` fails to parse Greek characters, which suggests that during the parsing process, there might be an issue in handling non-standard characters or symbols. This could be related to how the parser (possibly the `MathematicaParser` class instantiated at line 81) interprets input strings, especially those containing special or non-ASCII characters like Greek letters.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior of `parse_mathematica` is to accurately parse and translate Mathematica expressions into their SymPy equivalents, including those that contain Greek characters. For strings like `'\u03bb'`, the function should return the SymPy representation of these characters without raising syntax errors. This implies that the parsing logic should robustly handle a wide range of Mathematica expressions, including those containing Greek letters, by ensuring they are correctly translated or appropriately represented in the SymPy expression tree.\n\nGiven these insights and recognizing a potential gap in our understanding of how the `MathematicaParser` class or Greek characters are specifically handled, further investigation is warranted. To this end, we might consider:\n\n- Searching for the `MathematicaParser` class to understand its parsing rules and mechanism, especially regarding non-ASCII symbols.\n- Since the direct search for \"Greek characters\" was unfruitful, considering alternative search strategies might be helpful. This could include looking for more general terms related to character encoding or symbol handling within the parser or broader `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module.\n\nNext steps for API calls could include:\n\n- `search_class(\"MathematicaParser\")`\n- `search_code(\"character encoding\")`\n- `search_code(\"symbol handling\")`"
