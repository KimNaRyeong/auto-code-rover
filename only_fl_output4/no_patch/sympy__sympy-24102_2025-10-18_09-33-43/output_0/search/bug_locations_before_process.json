        "intended_behavior": "The method(s) within the MathematicaParser class responsible for parsing Mathematica expressions to SymPy should be enhanced to correctly recognize and translate Greek characters (and potentially other non-ASCII characters). This includes ensuring that any such characters are either:\n\n- Directly translated to their SymPy equivalents if they represent known mathematical symbols or constants (e.g., translating Mathematica's 'Pi' to SymPy's pi). This might involve extending the _atom_conversions dictionary or similar structures within the parser.\n- Appropriately handled as variable names or symbols in the SymPy expression when they don't directly correspond to specific constants or functions. This would ensure that the parser keeps these characters intact during the translation process, allowing the generated SymPy expressions to accurately reflect the original Mathematica input.\n\nThe overall goal is to preserve the parser's existing functionality while ensuring it can handle expressions containing Greek characters without throwing syntax errors. This will likely require reviewing and potentially adjusting the parser's regular expressions, conversion rules, and symbol handling mechanisms to accommodate the broader character set used in Mathematica expressions."
