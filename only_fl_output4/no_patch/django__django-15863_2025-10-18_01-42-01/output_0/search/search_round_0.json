Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.\nPull request is prepared \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15863\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the details of the issue involving the `floatformat` template filter dropping precision when used for `Decimal` numbers in Django, we'll need to analyze the implementation of this filter to determine why `Decimal` numbers are being incorrectly converted to `float`. Let's gather more context around the `floatformat` filter, as well as its usage and implementation in Django.\n\nTo do so, we may need to:\n\n1. **Find the implementation of `floatformat` filter**: Since the `floatformat` is a template filter, it's likely defined as a function or part of a class that Django uses to register and apply template filters.\n\n2. **Examine how `Decimal` values are handled within `floatformat`**: Based on the issue, there seems to be an incorrect conversion that leads to loss of precision, suggesting that the method may either directly or indirectly (through a helper function) handle `Decimal` types improperly.\n\nGiven these objectives, let's construct our API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"floatformat\")`: This will help identify where the `floatformat` filter is implemented within Django's template filter system.\n- `search_code(\"Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')\")`: This exact string of code might not be found, but searching for the usage of `Decimal` in the context of formatting or in the same file where `floatformat` is implemented could highlight relevant handling.\n- `search_code(\"value|floatformat\")`: Since the issue is related to template filter usage, searching for instances where `floatformat` is applied in the codebase can provide insights into its typical usage patterns that may influence its design or implementation details.\n\nLet's start with these searches to gather sufficient code context."
