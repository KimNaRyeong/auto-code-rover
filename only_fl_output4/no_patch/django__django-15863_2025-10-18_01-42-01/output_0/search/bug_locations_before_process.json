        "intended_behavior": "The core intention behind the `floatformat` method is to format a number (specifically a floating-point number or a `Decimal`) to a specified number of decimal places. The bug arises from converting a `Decimal` value to a float before formatting, which causes a loss of precision\u2014contrary to the expectations when working with `Decimal` objects. To resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality for floats and introducing correct handling for `Decimal` values, the method's implementation should be updated with the following considerations: - **Direct `Decimal` Handling:** Directly format the `Decimal` input without converting it to float. This involves checking if the input `text` can be converted directly into a `Decimal` and if so, skipping any pathways that would convert it to a float. This approach should maintain the precision of `Decimal` inputs. - **No Conversion to Float for Decimals:** Ensure that any code path that currently results in a `Decimal` first being cast to a float and then back to a `Decimal` is either avoided or replaced with a direct `Decimal` manipulation strategy. This could mean adjusting lines 154-160 where conversion and fallback handling occur, ensuring that `text` recognized as a `Decimal` does not go through unnecessary float conversion. - **Preserve Existing Functionality:** Any modifications made to better handle `Decimal` inputs must preserve the current functionality of the `floatformat` filter for floating-point numbers (`float`). This means maintaining the current handling and formatting logic for inputs that are not `Decimal`. By directly handling `Decimal` values and avoiding their conversion to floats, the `floatformat` method should correctly preserve the precision of `Decimal` numbers, adhering to the expected functionality without affecting the behavior for floating-point numbers."
