        "content": "Analyzing the collected context based on the results:\n\n### 1. Current Implementation of `get_random_string`\n- **File:** `django/utils/crypto.py`\n- **Code Snippet:**\n  ```python\n  def get_random_string(length=12,\n                        allowed_chars='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n                                      'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'):\n      \"\"\"\n      Return a securely generated random string.\n      \n      The default length of 12 with the a-z, A-Z, 0-9 character set returns\n      a 71-bit value. log_2((26+26+10)^12) =~ 71 bits\n      \"\"\"\n      return ''.join(secrets.choice(allowed_chars) for i in range(length))\n  ```\n- **Analysis:**\n  - This method generates a random string, by default 12 characters long, using a specific set of characters.\n  - Relevant to the bug because it highlights the default length of 12, which the issue suggests removing to enforce explicit length specification.\n\n### 2. Usage of `get_random_string`\n- **Files & Matches:**\n  - `django/middleware/csrf.py` (2 matches)\n  - `django/db/backends/oracle/creation.py` (2 matches)\n  - `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py` (2 matches)\n  - `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py` (2 matches)\n  - `django/contrib/auth/hashers.py` (4 matches)\n  - `django/core/files/storage.py` (2 matches)\n  - `django/core/management/utils.py` (2 matches)\n- **Analysis:**\n  - `get_random_string` is used across various components of Django, including middleware, database backends, authentication, file storage, and management tools.\n  - Each usage might depend on the default length of 12, so changing this behavior to require an explicit length calls for a careful assessment of how each part of the system calls this function. The relationship to the bug is direct, as any change to force explicit length specification impacts these components.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution\n- After resolving the issue, callers of `get_random_string` would need to explicitly specify the length of the string they want to generate. This change promotes better clarity on the requirements for the string's length at each usage point and reduces the reliance on a \"hidden\" default value that may not be immediately obvious to all developers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps involve:\n- Identifying all places in the code where `get_random_string` is invoked without specifying a length to understand the scope of the change.\n- Evaluating whether any documentation references the default behavior that must be updated.\n- Planning the migration strategy for updating existing calls to `get_random_string`, ensuring they specify a length explicitly to match the new requirement."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This change enforces that all calls to this method must explicitly specify the `length` of the string they wish to generate. The existing functionality of generating a random string based on the specified `allowed_chars` remains the same. Modification to this method will ensure that developers are mindful of the length of the strings being generated, rather than relying on a preset length.\n\nGiven the issue's context and the analysis, the primary change needs to be made in the `get_random_string` method to address the issue directly. Other files where `get_random_string` is used do not inherently contain bugs but will require updates to their calls to `get_random_string` to specify the length explicitly, complying with the new method signature. These updates are a consequence of the change in `django/utils/crypto.py` and are necessary for maintaining functionality across the project after the method's adjustment."
