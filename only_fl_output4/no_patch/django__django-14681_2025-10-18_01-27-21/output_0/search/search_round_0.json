Request aborted.\nReason given for failure: CSRF token missing or incorrect.\nExpected behaviour:\nFilesystem error or similar reporting incorrect media storage setup.\nComment:\nYes, the setup in this scenario is invalid to begin with, but the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem.\nI suspect a real problem with an underlying filesystem will also get covered in the same way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, I will select the following API calls with concrete arguments based on the issue description:\n\n1. Search for the `File` class in the `models.py` file to understand how file uploads are modeled:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"File\", \"app/models.py\")`\n\n2. Look into the `admin.py` file to see how the `File` model is registered and if any custom admin actions might affect the issue:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"admin.site.register(File)\", \"app/admin.py\")`\n\n3. Investigate how `MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`, and `FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR` are configured in `settings.py`, as they are crucial for understanding how the application handles media files and temporary files:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"MEDIA_URL = '/media/'\", \"csrfbug/settings.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"MEDIA_ROOT = 'media/'\", \"csrfbug/settings.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 1024 * 1024\", \"csrfbug/settings.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR = MEDIA_ROOT + 'tmp'\", \"csrfbug/settings.py\")`\n\n4. To better understand the upload mechanism and how it handles error scenarios like missing directories or filesystem issues, search for Django's built-in handlers or any custom implementation that might override or extend the default behavior:\n   - `search_method(\"handle_upload\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context of how file uploads are implemented, how temporary files are managed, and how the application is configured to handle media files in the codebase. This information will be crucial for diagnosing the CSRF error reported when there is a problem with storage and developing a fix."
