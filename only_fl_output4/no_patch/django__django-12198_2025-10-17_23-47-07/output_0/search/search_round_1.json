The core aspects are the `sensitive_variables` decorator, the `authenticate` method within a custom `AuthenticationBackend`, and how `inspect.getcallargs` interacts with decorated methods. Let's plan the API calls accordingly:\n\n1. **`sensitive_variables` Decorator**: Since this is likely not a method, but rather a function or a specific utility, we should start by searching for any code that mentions `sensitive_variables` directly. This will help us understand how it's implemented or used throughout the codebase. \n\n2. **Custom `AuthenticationBackend` Class**: `authenticate` is a method likely belonging to classes that derive from a base authentication backend. We may not find a direct hit for \"CustomAuthenticationBackend\" as the class name, but searching for `authenticate` within classes that contain `AuthenticationBackend` in their name would be a good start. The original `AuthenticationBackend` class should also be located.\n\n3. **Usage of `inspect.getcallargs`**: Since the issue mentions an interaction with `inspect.getcallargs`, we should look for its usage, especially in conjunction with `authenticate` methods or within the implementation of `sensitive_variables`.\n\nGiven these insights, the API calls to make are:\n\n- `search_code(\"sensitive_variables\")`: To find the implementation or usage of the `sensitive_variables` decorator.\n- `search_class(\"AuthenticationBackend\")`: To find the base class or any derivatives of `AuthenticationBackend`.\n- `search_method(\"authenticate\")`: To find implementations of the `authenticate` method across the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"inspect.getcallargs\")`: To locate where `inspect.getcallargs` is used, potentially in relation to the issue at hand.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context for the issue, allowing for targeted investigation and eventual patch development."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us insights into how the `sensitive_variables` decorator, `authenticate` methods, and `inspect.getcallargs` function interact within the Django framework. Let\u2019s break down each part:\n\n### 1. `sensitive_variables` Usage\nThe `sensitive_variables` decorator has been found primarily in two files:\n- `django/views/debug.py`\n- `django/views/decorators/debug.py`\n\nThis suggests that `sensitive_variables` is used for debugging purposes, likely to prevent sensitive information from being displayed in error reports or logs. **Given the issue**, the relationship suggests that when `authenticate` methods are decorated with `sensitive_variables`, it somehow affects the signature in a way that `inspect.getcallargs` always succeeds, leading to unintended behavior. The intended behavior would be for `sensitive_variables` to obscure sensitive variables without altering the function's callability or its argument verification process.\n\n### 2. No Direct `AuthenticationBackend` Class Found\nThe search for the `AuthenticationBackend` class yielded no results, which could mean the class might not be directly exposed or named as such, or it's dynamically referenced within methods without a direct class definition accessible through the search API used. To get around this, diving deeper into where `authenticate` methods are defined or used (as found in the search for `authenticate`) would be the next best step.\n\n### 3. `authenticate` Methods Context\nThe `authenticate` methods are found in:\n- `django/contrib/auth/__init__.py`\n- `django/contrib/auth/backends.py`\n\nThese locations are very likely where custom authentication backends are implemented or referenced. The methods in these files are central to Django\u2019s authentication system. **Given the issue**, the `authenticate` method in these contexts is directly impacted by the use of `sensitive_variables`. Ideally, these methods should correctly handle credentials, providing a secure authentication mechanism that respects custom backends' requirements.\n\n### 4. `inspect.getcallargs` Usage\nFound in `django/contrib/auth/__init__.py` within the `authenticate` function and in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, its usage seems focused on validating arguments for function calls. The snippet in `authenticate` highlights an attempt to validate if the backend's `authenticate` method can accept the given credentials as arguments. **Given the issue**, this process is failing or being falsely bypassed for decorated `authenticate` functions, leading to uncaught `TypeError` exceptions for mismatched arguments. The intended behavior would be a proper argument mapping and validation, ensuring only compatible backends proceed with authentication attempts.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Investigate Decorated Functions**: To further understand the issue, it's essential to examine how `sensitive_variables` modifies a function's signature or interacts with Python's introspection capabilities, particularly `inspect.getcallargs`. An additional API call to explore the implementation or usage of `sensitive_variables` in `django/views/decorators/debug.py` could provide this context.\n- **Inspect `authenticate` Implementation**: The snippet from `django/contrib/auth/__init__.py` where `inspect.getcallargs` is used within `authenticate` is directly related to the bug. Understanding if and how `sensitive_variables` alters the expected behavior here is crucial.\n- Since the class `AuthenticationBackend` was not directly found, exploring the files where `authenticate` methods are present (`django/contrib/auth/backends.py` and `django/contrib/auth/__init__.py`) could help identify how custom backends are structured or how they should be implemented, providing insight into the expected behavior of these methods when decorated.\n\nGiven these analyses, additional searches or direct inspections of the mentioned files and functionalities may yield the necessary details for resolving the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This implies that when applied to an `authenticate` method in custom authentication backends, it should not interfere with `inspect.getcallargs` ability to accurately validate function arguments. The decorator should ensure sensitive variables are obscured without altering the callable signature or how the function's arguments are processed. This might require adjusting the implementation of `sensitive_variables` to better handle decorated functions, ensuring compatibility with Python's introspection used by `inspect.getcallargs`.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File**: `django/contrib/auth/__init__.py`\n   - **Function**: `authenticate`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: The `authenticate` function should handle scenarios where the `authenticate` method of backends is decorated (e.g., with `sensitive_variables`), without leading to unintended `TypeError` exceptions for mismatched arguments. This might involve adjusting how `inspect.getcallargs` is used to validate credentials against backends' `authenticate` methods or implementing additional checks to ensure compatibility with decorated methods. The goal is to allow custom backends that use `sensitive_variables` to work as expected, as they did in version 1.6.\n\nThe resolution involves ensuring the `sensitive_variables` decorator does not alter the function behavior in ways that affect its interaction with `inspect.getcallargs`, and that `authenticate` function in Django\u2019s auth system can correctly handle calls to backends that use this decorator. This preserves both the security intent of `sensitive_variables` and the functionality of custom authentication backends."
