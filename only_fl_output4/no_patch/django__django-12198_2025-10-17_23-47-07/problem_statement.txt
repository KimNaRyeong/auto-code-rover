Allow sensitive_variables() to preserve the signature of its decorated function
Description
	
When the method authenticate of a custom AuthenticationBackend is decorated with sensitive_variables, inspect.getcallargs will always match.
Calling the authenticate function will attempt to call this backend with any set of credentials and will raise an uncaught TypeError for an unmatching backend.
Authentication with such decorated backends used to work in version 1.6.
