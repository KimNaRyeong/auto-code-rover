Given the feedback from the execution of the previous script, it seems the error was due to the absence of the database tables required for the Django models. This is a common issue when running scripts without performing Django migrations. To address this, we can modify the script to dynamically create the necessary tables using Django's model APIs directly. This should bypass the need for manual migrations and make the script self-contained for the purpose of reproducing the issue with the `When` clause alongside `Exists`.

Here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that includes dynamic table creation:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connections, OperationalError
from django.db.models import Case, When, Value, Exists, OuterRef, Q

# Minimal configuration for Django
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',  # This module (a quirk of how we're running things)
    ),
    USE_I18N=True,
    USE_L10N=True,
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define models
class State(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class County(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    state = models.ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

# Function to print exceptions in a readable format
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
      
def create_tables():
    with connections['default'].schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        schema_editor.create_model(State)
        schema_editor.create_model(County)

# Main function to reproduce the issue
def main():
    # Dynamically create tables for our models
    create_tables()

    # Prepare test data
    try:
        texas = State.objects.create()
        County.objects.create(name="Dallas", state=texas)

        # Attempt to use When with Exists as outlined in the issue description
        annotated_counties = County.objects.annotate(
            status=Case(
                When(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name="Texas")), name="Dallas", then=Value("DALLAS COUNTY")),
                default=Value("ELSEWHERE"),
            )
        )
        for county in annotated_counties:
            # Just forcing evaluation of the queryset
            pass

        print("Issue not reproduced - execution successful.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An error occurred attempting to reproduce the issue.") from e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Key Changes and Additions:**

1. **Dynamic Table Creation**: Added a `create_tables` function that creates tables for `State` and `County` models dynamically at runtime.
2. **Table Creation Invocation**: `create_tables` is called within `main` to ensure necessary tables exist before executing the core script logic.
3. **Exception Handling Refinement**: Generalized the exception catching in `main()` to catch any exception, not just `TypeError`, to properly raise an `AssertionError` if any error is encountered during script execution. This change ensures that any unforeseen issues are also captured.
4. **Direct Use of SQLite Database**: Ensures the SQLite database is created in the current working directory for easy access and inspection.

This script should now first attempt to dynamically create the necessary tables before proceeding to execute the ORM operations that are expected to reproduce the issue, thereby avoiding the previous error related to missing tables.
