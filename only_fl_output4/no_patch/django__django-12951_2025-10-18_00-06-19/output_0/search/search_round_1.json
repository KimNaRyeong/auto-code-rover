For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Analysis of the `When` Class Implementation\n- **What it does:** The `When` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` allows for conditional expressions in database queries, used primarily within a `Case` statement. It takes a condition and a result, along with additional lookups as keyword arguments.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue highlights the inability to use an `Exists` expression directly in a `When` condition alongside keyword arguments without wrapping it in a `Q` object. From the implementation details, the `__init__` method of `When` seems to be the focal point since it dictates how conditions and additional arguments are handled.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, the `When` class should allow an `Exists` expression along with keyword arguments to be passed directly, similar to how the `filter` method functions with these expressions. Simplifying the syntax without requiring a wrap in a `Q` object aligns with the requested enhancement.\n\n#### 2. Analysis of the `Exists` Class Implementation\n- **What it does:** The `Exists` class is a subclass of `Subquery` designed to represent an EXISTS SQL expression, which returns a boolean value indicating the existence of a row in a subquery. It's used in Django to build conditional expressions in queryset filtering.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue is centered around using `Exists` within a `When` condition in a manner consistent with its use in filtering queries. That implies adjustments may be needed in how `When` interprets or integrates `Exists` expressions.\n- **Intended behavior:** The `Exists` class appears to function as expected. The change required seems to be in how `When` interacts with an `Exists` expression, not in `Exists` itself.\n\n#### 3. Filtering in `QuerySet`\n- **What it does:** Among the files where `filter` methods were found, `django/db/models/query.py` is the relevant context. The `filter` method allows for narrowing down a queryset based on given parameters, which can include field lookups, Q objects, and expressions like `Exists`.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The submitted issue suggests a disparity in handling expressions between the `filter` method and `Case`/`When` functionality. Specifically, `filter` accommodates an `Exists` expression alongside keyword arguments in a way the `When` method currently does not.\n- **Intended behavior:** Given the described problem, the `filter` method's acceptance and handling of `Exists` expressions with keyword arguments illustrate the desired interaction model for `When` and `Exists`. Thus, aligning `When`'s behavior with that of `filter` could be the solution.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe relationship between `When`, `Exists`, and `filter` in Django highlights a discrepancy in how conditional expressions are handled in different contexts. The issue with `When` not accepting an `Exists` expression directly alongside keyword arguments (unlike `filter`) suggests a need to modify `When`'s `__init__` method or its handling of arguments to incorporate a more flexible, consistent approach.\n\nTo move forward, it would be beneficial to inspect the implementation of the `filter` method within `django/db/models/query.py` to understand how it processes arguments like `Exists` expressions and keyword arguments. This understanding could guide the adjustment of the `When` class to achieve the desired behavior.\n\nConsidering this, a relevant next step would include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"filter\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`: To delve into the specifics of how `filter` approaches argument processing, providing insights into adapting `When`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

This enhancement should preserve the existing functionality of handling simple conditions, Q objects, and lookups. Modifications may include adjusting the method's logic to check for and correctly interpret an `Exists` expression as a condition while still processing additional keyword arguments for the conditional expression. This change aims to make the syntactic handling of `Exists` in `When` conditions consistent with how the `filter` method processes its arguments, thereby improving developer convenience and maintaining coherence across Django's ORM API.\n\nThis approach ensures that `When`'s ability to dynamically handle conditional expressions, including integration with `Exists`, aligns more closely with user expectations and the broader versatility of Django's querying capabilities. The emphasis is on enhancing usability without detracting from the method's existing capabilities or introducing regressions in how conditions are evaluated and applied within `Case` statements."
