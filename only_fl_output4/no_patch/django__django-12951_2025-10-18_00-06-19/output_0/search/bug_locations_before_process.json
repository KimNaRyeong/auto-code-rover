        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of the `When` class should be enhanced to allow direct use of an `Exists` expression (or any suitable queryset expression) alongside keyword arguments without necessitating the argument to be wrapped in a `Q` object. This enhancement should preserve the existing functionality of handling simple conditions, Q objects, and lookups. Modifications may include adjusting the method's logic to check for and correctly interpret an `Exists` expression as a condition while still processing additional keyword arguments for the conditional expression. This change aims to make the syntactic handling of `Exists` in `When` conditions consistent with how the `filter` method processes its arguments, thereby improving developer convenience and maintaining coherence across Django's ORM API. This approach ensures that `When`'s ability to dynamically handle conditional expressions, including integration with `Exists`, aligns more closely with user expectations and the broader versatility of Django's querying capabilities. The emphasis is on enhancing usability without detracting from the method's existing capabilities or introducing regressions in how conditions are evaluated and applied within `Case` statements."
