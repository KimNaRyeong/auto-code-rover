        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, we should focus on finding where and how Django sets up these scripts (`django-admin` and `django-admin.py`) in its installation process. This involves looking at both the entry points and the script installation mechanism in the `setup.py` file as mentioned in the issue description. Also, examining how `execute_from_command_line` is implemented and used could provide further insight into why both scripts were maintained up to this point.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the setup.py file in the Django project**\n   - Since `setup.py` content is central to the issue but not directly searchable via the provided APIs, let's look for any references or modifications to `entry_points` and `scripts` within Django's setup context.\n   - `search_code(\"entry_points={'console_scripts':\")`\n   - `search_code(\"scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']\")`\n\n2. **Get more context around django-admin script configuration**\n   - To better understand how Django configures its command line interface and possibly optimizes it based on the entry points setup, we need to examine how `django-admin` and `django-admin.py` are intended to function within the framework.\n   - `search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")`\n   - Since the issue mentions the `django.core.management:execute_from_command_line`, seeking more information about this specific method could be particularly useful.\n\n3. **Examine the `execute_from_command_line` implementation**\n   - Understanding the implementation of `execute_from_command_line` can give insight into its usage and need within the Django scripts.\n   - `search_class(\"management\")`\n   - This will help us find where the `execute_from_command_line` method is located within the `management` module, which both scripts call.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a detailed view of how Django's command-line configuration is structured and might reveal paths for consolidating the two scripts into a single entry point without affecting Django's functionality."
