        "intended_behavior": "The code should be modified to accept an additional optional parameter, 'bits', with a default value of 'None'. This parameter is intended to allow the caller to specify a minimum length for the returned digits list, where the length includes the base plus the digits (excluding the base, the list's length should be at least 'bits' long when 'bits' is not 'None'). After calculating the digits as per the current implementation, the function should check if 'bits' is provided and not 'None'. If so, it should determine the current number of digits (excluding the base) and compare this number to the 'bits' value. If the current number of digits is less than 'bits', the function should prepend zero digits ('0') to the list until the total length matches the 'bits' criteria. This padding should be done before adding the base element (which is the first element in the final list) but after reversing the order of the calculated digits, ensuring the zeros are added as leading zeros in the number's representation. This enhancement allows the 'digits' function to output lists of digits that fulfill a specific length requirement, enabling better alignment with binary and other base representations used in various applications, without altering the fundamental behavior for existing calls where 'bits' is not specified."
