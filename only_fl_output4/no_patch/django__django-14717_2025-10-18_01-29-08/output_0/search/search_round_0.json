Here is one of them: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/fe074c96a343530beea50fbdd0803d3e7b739e8e/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L1156-L1167\nFor example, in each of them, timezone.now() is called even when the return value isn't needed / won't be used.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the required context for resolving the issue concerning the optimization and potential bug in `_check_fix_default_value()` methods related to time handling in Django models, we need to examine the implementations of these methods, how they're being used, and any relevant code that interacts with them, including the call to `timezone.now()` mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we should look at:\n\n1. The implementation of the `_check_fix_default_value()` method(s) as described in the issue.\n2. Other occurrences of `_check_fix_default_value()` in the same file to understand their use and potential variations in implementation.\n3. The implementation and usage of `timezone.now()` in these methods to identify where optimizations can be made.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls can be made to collect the necessary information:\n\n```python\n# To fetch the implementation and context of the specific `_check_fix_default_value()` method referred to in the issue.\nget_code_around_line(file_path=\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", line_number=1156, window_size=15)\n\n# To search for other occurrences of the `_check_fix_default_value()` method within the same file to understand their implementation and usage context.\nsearch_method_in_file(method_name=\"_check_fix_default_value\", file_path=\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")\n\n# To find where `timezone.now()` is used within the `_check_fix_default_value()` methods to understand how it's being used and if the call is unnecessary at some points.\nsearch_code_in_file(code_str=\"timezone.now()\", file_path=\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the issue from the source code's perspective, allowing for an informed approach to optimizing the code and fixing the mentioned bug."
