Does it make sense to support this case. It will return the identity matrix which is not the use case for the `StandardScaler`. If we wish a transformer to do so, one should use the `FunctionTransformer` I assume.\n2. If we consider this behaviour normal, we need to:\n* In the dense case, force `self.mean_` to be `None` after each iteration of `partial_fit`.\n* In the sparse case, compute the non-NaNs values and update `self.n_samples_seen_` which is not computed. It leads currently to an error if calling twice `fit` (i.e. `del self.n_samples_seen_` will fail).\nIMO, we should make a checking at `fit` raise an error.\n@jnothman @ogrisel WDYT?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context on several aspects of the `StandardScaler` implementation and its behavior with `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False` settings. Specifically, we need to:\n\n1. Understand how `StandardScaler` manages `mean_` and `n_samples_seen_` attributes during the `fit` and `partial_fit` processes.\n2. Investigate how the scaler handles both sparse and dense data inputs, especially in relation to the issue described.\n3. Assess the handling of `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False` configurations to decide whether to raise an error or adjust the implementation.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following search API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_class(\"StandardScaler\")`: To get the file location(s) or initial context of the `StandardScaler` class, including documentation that might hint at intended behavior.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StandardScaler\")`: To examine the `fit` method's handling of sparse versus dense data, particularly how `mean_` and `n_samples_seen_` are managed.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"StandardScaler\")`: To observe how incremental fitting updates are managed, which is relevant for the handling of `n_samples_seen_` and consistency checks.\n- `search_code(\"with_mean=False\")`: To identify all instances in the code where this configuration is checked or implemented, which can provide insights into handling of such cases.\n- `search_code(\"with_std=False\")`: Similarly, to find all relevant code sections where `with_std=False` is considered or affects processing.\n- `search_code(\"self.mean_ = None\")`: This search is to identify if there\u2019s existing code that explicitly sets `self.mean_` to `None`, which is proposed as a fix for the dense case.\n- `search_code(\"self.n_samples_seen_\")`: To explore how `n_samples_seen_` is calculated, updated, or deleted across both fitting methods and how it differs between sparse and dense inputs.\n\nThese API calls will equip us with a comprehensive understanding of the `StandardScaler` implementation relevant to the described issue, enabling an informed decision on how to proceed with a patch."
