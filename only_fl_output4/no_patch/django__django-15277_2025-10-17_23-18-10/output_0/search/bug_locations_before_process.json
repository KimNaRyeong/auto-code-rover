        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `CharField.__init__` method to check if `max_length` is not `None` before appending a `MaxLengthValidator`. This change ensures that a `MaxLengthValidator` is only added when `max_length` is provided, thereby avoiding the `TypeError` when `CharField` instances (created without specific `max_length`, such as those instantiated indirectly by `Value._resolve_output_field`) attempt to validate data. This adjustment preserves the current functionality of `CharField` for cases where `max_length` is provided, while preventing errors in scenarios where it is not."
