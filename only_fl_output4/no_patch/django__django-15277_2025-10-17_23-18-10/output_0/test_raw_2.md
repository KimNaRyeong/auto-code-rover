To accurately reproduce the issue based on your requirements, we'll craft a standalone Python script that should be executed in the context of a Django project. This script will specifically replicate the issue described with `Value._resolve_output_field()` and `CharField`'s handling of `max_length=None`, attempting to trigger a `TypeError` due to a comparison with `NoneType` that signifies the problem.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'mydatabase',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            '__main__',  # This registers this standalone script as an app to allow model discovery by Django.
        ]
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

setup_django_environment()

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

try:
    from django.db.models import Value
    
    # Create a Value instance with a string, triggering CharField's __init__ indirectly.
    value_instance = Value('test')
    resolved_field = value_instance._resolve_output_field()

    # Attempting to clean a string using the resolved field.
    # Expecting this to potentially raise a TypeError due to the MaxLengthValidator issue.
    try:
        resolved_field.clean('test_value', model_instance=None)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected: TypeError due to improper handling of max_length=None.")
    else:
        print("No issue detected. CharField correctly handles max_length=None.")

except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
    raise SystemExit(1)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    raise SystemExit(1)
```

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure that Django is installed in your Python environment.
2. Save the above script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project.
3. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

**Expected Behavior:**

- When the issue described is present, the script will catch a `TypeError`, print the stack trace, and exit with code 1.
- If the issue is not present (i.e., if Django's `CharField` has been corrected to handle `max_length=None` gracefully), the script will not raise any exceptions and will exit with code 0, indicating no issues detected.

This approach ensures a clear demonstration of whether the specific issue with `CharField.__init__` and `Value._resolve_output_field()` exists.
