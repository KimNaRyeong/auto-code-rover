Given the requirements, let's adjust the previously provided script with the proper context and ensure it meets the criteria for both executing properly and detecting the issue. Please ensure that your environment is correctly set up with the necessary dependencies, including a working installation of scikit-learn.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Since we cannot load real data as in the original issue description, let's create a simple dataset.
    np.random.seed(0)
    X = np.random.rand(100, 1)  # 100 samples, 1 feature
    y = X.squeeze() ** 2 + np.random.normal(0, 0.05, 100)  # Quadratic relationship with noise

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)

    try:
        clf.fit(X, y)
        print("score: ", clf.score(X, y))
        print("iters: ", clf.n_iter_, " / ", max_iter)
        assert clf.n_iter_ == max_iter, "Training did not run for the specified number of iterations."
        print("The issue seems to be resolved or did not occur as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1) from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script should be saved as `reproducer.py` and run in an environment where scikit-learn is properly installed. It tries to mimic the issue by using a small randomly generated dataset. If the `MLPRegressor` does not reach the specified number of iterations (`max_iter=18000`) and instead stops at the default limit of 15000 iterations due to the mentioned issue, the assertion will fail, triggering the `print_stacktrace` function to show where the problem occurred.

Please make sure your scikit-learn installation is correct and the environment has been properly configured to avoid import or build errors as seen previously.
