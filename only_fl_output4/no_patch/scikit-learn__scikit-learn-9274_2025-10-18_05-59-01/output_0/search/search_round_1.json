        "content": "<issue>Training MLP using l-bfgs limited to default l-bfgs maxiter value\n#### Description\nTraining an MLP regressor (or classifier) using l-bfgs currently cannot run for more than (approx) 15000 iterations.\nThis artificial limit is caused by the call site to l-bfgs passing the MLP argument value \"max_iters\" to the argument for \"maxfun\" (maximum number of function calls), but not for \"maxiter\" (maximum number of iterations), so that no matter how large a number you pass as \"max_iters\" to train for MLP, the iterations are capped by the default value for maxiter (15000).\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nFit an MLP for a problem that requires > 15000 iterations\nHere is an example (tested in python 2.7):\nhttps://gist.github.com/daniel-perry/d9e356a03936673e58e0ce47d5fc70ef\n(you will need data.npy from the gist linked to above)\n````\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor\ntrain = np.load(\"data.npy\").tolist()\nmax_iter = 18000\nclf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)\nclf.fit(train[\"train_x\"],train[\"train_y\"])\nprint(\"score: \", clf.score(train[\"train_x\"],train[\"train_y\"]))\nprint(\"iters: \", clf.n_iter_, \" / \", max_iter)\n````\n#### Expected Results\nThe training should run for 18000 iterations.\n#### Actual Results\nThe training runs for 15000 iterations.\n#### Versions\nHere are my local version details, though the problem appears to exist on the current head, and so should exist for any python/sklearn versions.\n'Python', '2.7.12 (default, Jul  1 2016, 15:12:24) \\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]'\n'NumPy', '1.13.0'\n'SciPy', '0.19.1'\n'Scikit-Learn', '0.18'\n[WIP] FIX: use maxiter rather than maxfun in MultiLayerPerceptron with solver='lbfgs'\nIn my limited experience with LBFGS, the number of function calls is greater than the number of iterations.\nThe impact of this bug is that with solver='lbfgs' is probably not doing as many iterations as it should in master although I am not sure it matters that much in practice.\nTo get an idea how much funtion calls differ from iterations, I tweaked `examples/neural_networks/plot_mnist_filters.py` to be able to run for a few hundred iterations:\n```py\nmlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), max_iter=1000, alpha=1e-4,\nsolver='lbfgs', verbose=10, tol=1e-16, random_state=1,\nlearning_rate_init=.1)\n```\nThe result: 393 iterations and 414 function calls.\nNot sure whether we nest to test this, and how to test it, suggestions more than welcome!\n- [ ] add a whats_new entry once there is agreement\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### MLPRegressor and MLPClassifier Classes\n\nBoth `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier` classes are found in the same file, `sklearn/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py`. They both inherit from `BaseMultilayerPerceptron` and implement specific mixins (`RegressorMixin` and `ClassifierMixin` respectively). This structure indicates they share common functionality for handling multilayer perceptrons in scikit-learn, making them closely interconnected, particularly in terms of fitting data and being trained with various solvers.\n\nThe `__init__` method in both classes reveals parameters `hidden_layer_sizes`, `activation`, and `solver` among others, which are crucial for training the neural network. The mention of `solver='adam'` as the default solver but allowing for the use of others, including `lbfgs`, provides context for where the issue might exist in handling solvers differently.\n\n#### The `fit` Method in MLPClassifier\n\nThe search for the `fit` function in `MLPRegressor` did not yield any results, but we found the `fit` function in `MLPClassifier`. This might hint at a shared or inherited `fit` method from a common base class that applies to both MLPRegressor and MLPClassifier, implementing the training logic inclusive of handling for the `solver` parameter.\n\nThe `fit` method in `MLPClassifier` delegates to a `_fit` method with an `incremental` parameter influenced by the `warm_start` configuration and whether the class has been fit before. Understanding this flow is crucial because the handling of `max_iter` within `_fit` or how solvers are configured might be the key to resolving the issue.\n\nThe issue details an artificial limit on training iterations due to how `max_iter` is interpreted or passed to the `solver='lbfgs'`. Understanding the `fit` or `_fit` function flow, especially how `max_iter` and solver configurations are handled therein, will be crucial for resolving the bug.\n\n#### Usage of `solver='lbfgs'` in the Codebase\n\nThe search highlights multiple occurrences of `solver='lbfgs'` outside the context of `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier`, indicating its use across different parts of Scikit-learn. This presents an opportunity to compare configurations and understand if there's a specific handling or a missing argument passing for `solver='lbfgs'` within the neural network code that could inform the patch development.\n\n### Next Steps for Gathering More Context\n\n1. **Investigating the _fit method**: Since the `fit` method in `MLPClassifier` and potentially `MLPRegressor` calls a `_fit` method, it's necessary to dive deeper into this method to discover how it interprets `max_iter` and `solver='lbfgs'`.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"_fit\", \"BaseMultilayerPerceptron\")`\n\n2. **Exploring how `max_iter` is used in context with `lbfgs` solver**: There was no direct reference to how `max_iter` is handled specifically for `lbfgs` in the collected context. Since `lbfgs` configurations were also found in other components (e.g., `logistic.py`), looking into those might offer insights into the standard or special handling of `lbfgs` that could be mirrored or adapted in `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier`.\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"lbfgs\", \"sklearn/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py\")`\n\nThese actions will help understand how `max_iter` and `solver='lbfgs'` are meant to work within the MLP training process and illuminate the path towards a bug fix."

This should replace or supplement the current implementation that restricts the number of iterations to the default `maxiter` value of the `lbfgs` solver, likely set around 15000. The implementation should ensure that when `solver='lbfgs'` is selected, both `maxfun` and `maxiter` reflect the user's intention (as specified by `max_iter` in `MLPRegressor`/`MLPClassifier`) without imposing the current implicit limit. This behavior modification will enable the `lbfgs` solver to use the specified number of iterations for training, thereby removing the artificial cap and aligning the actual training process with the user's configuration. This change must preserve the existing functionality for other solvers and for scenarios where the default `max_iter` is appropriate.\n\nThe resolution will involve ensuring that the `max_iter` argument directly influences the `lbfgs` solver's `maxiter` configuration parameter, in addition to or instead of its influence on `maxfun`, within the scope of MLP training, specifically affecting the implementations in `BaseMultilayerPerceptron` or wherever the solver configuration for `lbfgs` is explicitly handled."
