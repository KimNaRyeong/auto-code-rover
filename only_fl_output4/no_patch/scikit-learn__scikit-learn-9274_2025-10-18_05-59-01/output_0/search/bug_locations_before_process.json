This might entail passing 'max_iter' to the '_fit_lbfgs' call or ensuring that any default settings or limitations are overridden by the user's 'max_iter' preference. The handling should ensure that if a user specifies a 'max_iter' value, it is respected throughout the training process when 'solver='lbfgs'' is used, thus allowing the training to run for the intended number of iterations."

        "intended_behavior": "Adjust the implementation to respect the 'max_iter' parameter from the user, ensuring it directly influences the L-BFGS solver's maximum number of iterations, overriding the default maximum if needed. This could involve modifying how the 'max_iter' is passed to or used within '_fit_lbfgs', possibly requiring a change in the method's signature or how the 'solver_opts' are constructed and used. The goal is to eliminate the fixed iteration cap for the 'lbfgs' solver, allowing for flexible and user-defined training lengths. This adjustment should preserve existing functionality by ensuring changes are compatible with current code paths and defaults, only altering behavior when 'max_iter' is explicitly specified by the user."
