        "intended_behavior": "The `symbols` function is intended to support creating instances of different classes specified by the `cls` keyword, including when the input is a tuple containing sequence generators. For the reported issue, when `cls=Function` and the input is in the form of tuples meant for sequence generation (e.g., `('q:2', 'u:2')`), the function should correctly create instances of `Function` rather than defaulting to `Symbol`. This involves adjusting the function's logic to ensure that it: - Correctly interprets tuples and their content when `cls` is specified. - Parses sequence generator strings within tuples appropriately, applying the `cls` argument to create instances of the specified class (`Function` in this case) for each generated name. - Maintains existing functionalities for all types of inputs and `cls` arguments, without introducing regressions for current use cases (such as creating simple symbols, handling ranges, or instantiating other classes)."
