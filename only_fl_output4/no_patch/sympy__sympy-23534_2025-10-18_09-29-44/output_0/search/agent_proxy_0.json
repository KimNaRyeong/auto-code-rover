This involves discovering the exact method definition, any relevant class definitions, and any code snippets that showcase the usage or handling of the `symbols` function, especially in the context mentioned in the issue (creating functions with symbols when there are extra parentheses involved). Given the issue details, we will focus on finding where the `symbols` function is defined and how it processes its arguments.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"symbols\")` - Since the issue revolves around the `symbols` function, we first need to locate this function's definition within the codebase.\n2. `search_class(\"Function\")` - Understanding how the `Function` class is implemented could give insights into why an instance expected to be of this class ends up being a `Symbol` instead.\n3. `search_code(\"symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=Function)\")` - Search for code snippets similar to the one provided in the issue, to see if there are examples or tests within the codebase that reflect the correct or intended usage."
