This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

To adequately address this issue and prepare for creating a patch, I would need to gather more information about several aspects:\n\n1. **The definition and usage of `JXL_DEPRECATED`**: Understanding where and how `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined will give insight into how attributes are applied to enum values.\n\n2. **Parsing and handling of enum values in code**: Specifically, I want to see how the Sphinx extension or the relevant documentation generation tool handles enum values, particularly those with attributes.\n\n3. **Existing handling of `__attribute__` or similar constructs**: This will show if there is a mechanism that could be extended or adapted to also ignore attributes in `enum` values without affecting other parts.\n\nTo get the necessary code context for resolving the issue, I plan to use the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"JXL_DEPRECATED\")`: To find definitions or usages of the `JXL_DEPRECATED` to understand its context and how the attribute is defined.\n- `search_code(\"typedef enum\")`: This can help identify how enum definitions are parsed across the project, which is crucial for understanding where the issue with attribute parsing might occur.\n\nThese calls are aimed at gathering the required information about the use of attributes with enum values and the handling (or mishandling) of such cases in the documentation generation process."

This suggests that the specific terms or code patterns may be structured differently than anticipated, or they might be processed in a way that my search queries did not account for. Since we are dealing with C/C++ enum parsing and the Sphinx documentation generation, there are alternative approaches we can take to gather more context about how attributes are handled for enums in the project documentation generation process:\n\n1. **Investigate Documentation Generation Code**: Since the issue is related to documentation parsing and generation, it might be fruitful to explore how the project generates its documentation, especially regarding C/C++ code. This involves looking into any Sphinx extensions or configurations used.\n\n2. **Search for Sphinx Configuration**: It's possible that the project has custom Sphinx configuration files (`conf.py`) or uses specific Sphinx extensions for C/C++ code that might influence how code is parsed for documentation. Examining these could give insights into where the parsing issue might be fixed.\n\n3. **Examine How Attributes Are Parsed in C/C++ Code**: Given that the problem is with C/C++ `enum` attributes, it would be useful to look into any custom parsing logic that the project or Sphinx extensions it uses employ for attributes.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are some adjusted API calls to try:\n\n- **For Sphinx Configuration or Extensions**: `search_code(\"conf.py\")` or `search_code(\"sphinx.ext\")`. This could help locate the Sphinx configuration or any custom extensions that the project is using, which might have relevance to how enums are parsed.\n  \n- **For Custom Parsing Logic**: Since the direct search for enums didn't return results, it might be useful to look into the code that potentially manipulates or scans C/C++ code files. This could include scripts or tools that preprocess the code before it gets to Sphinx. Therefore, a search for keywords related to parsing or preprocessing could be informative: `search_code(\"parse\")` or `search_code(\"__attribute__\")`.\n\nThese searches aim to uncover how the project handles its documentation generation process, especially with respect to parsing C/C++ code and handling of `enum` attributes."

Unfortunately, since the initial search queries did not return any specific results or code segments related to the issue, and with no further successful queries provided that would yield insights into the project's codebase, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact locations of the bug or potential bugs at this time.\n\nFor a more productive next step, here's a theoretical outline of where the bug might reside and the general intended behavior needed for a resolution, based on common patterns in documentation generation systems and the nature of the issue:\n\n- **Bug Location**: Given the nature of the problem, the bug is likely within the documentation generation process, particularly in parts of the codebase that handle parsing and interpreting enum declarations in C/C++ code. This could reside in:\n  - A Sphinx configuration file (possibly `conf.py`), if there's custom logic for handling the project's C/C++ source documentation.\n  - A custom Sphinx extension, if the project uses one to parse C/C++ code, which might be misunderstanding the `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` part of enum values.\n  - A pre-processing script, which prepares C/C++ code for documentation parsing, failing to correctly handle or ignore `__attribute__` annotations on enums.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**:\n  - The documentation generator should correctly parse `enum` values regardless of any attributes (like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))`) appended to them. The parser should recognize `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as the enum value and treat `JXL_DEPRECATED` as an attribute that does not affect the name of the enum value. This would prevent it from mistakenly identifying `JXL_DEPRECATED` as the enum value itself.\n  - In a scenario where the bug is fixed, the documentation generation process would accurately represent `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` (and any similarly attributed enum values) in the output documentation, ignoring or correctly documenting deprecated attributes without causing duplicate declaration issues.\n\nWithout concrete code segments or file paths from the project, these descriptions remain speculative. A detailed investigation following the suggested methods for further context might be necessary to accurately identify the files and code constructs to be adjusted."
