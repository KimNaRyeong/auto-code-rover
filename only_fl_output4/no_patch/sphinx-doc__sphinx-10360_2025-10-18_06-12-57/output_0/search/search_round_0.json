        "content": "<issue>enum value with attribute misparsed\n### Describe the bug\nIn C/C++, `enum` values can have an attribute like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))`, but these do not get properly parsed.\n### How to Reproduce\nHere is an example where this occurred. This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue description, it appears the problem lies in how `enum` values with attributes (specifically with `__attribute__((__deprecated__))`) are parsed, leading to documentation generation errors. To adequately address this issue and prepare for creating a patch, I would need to gather more information about several aspects:\n\n1. **The definition and usage of `JXL_DEPRECATED`**: Understanding where and how `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined will give insight into how attributes are applied to enum values.\n\n2. **Parsing and handling of enum values in code**: Specifically, I want to see how the Sphinx extension or the relevant documentation generation tool handles enum values, particularly those with attributes.\n\n3. **Existing handling of `__attribute__` or similar constructs**: This will show if there is a mechanism that could be extended or adapted to also ignore attributes in `enum` values without affecting other parts.\n\nTo get the necessary code context for resolving the issue, I plan to use the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"JXL_DEPRECATED\")`: To find definitions or usages of the `JXL_DEPRECATED` to understand its context and how the attribute is defined.\n- `search_code(\"typedef enum\")`: This can help identify how enum definitions are parsed across the project, which is crucial for understanding where the issue with attribute parsing might occur.\n\nThese calls are aimed at gathering the required information about the use of attributes with enum values and the handling (or mishandling) of such cases in the documentation generation process."
