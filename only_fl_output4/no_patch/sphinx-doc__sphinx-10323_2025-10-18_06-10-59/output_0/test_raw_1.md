Given the specific requirements laid out for creating a standalone Python file to reproduce the issue, and the fact that the last attempt did not successfully run due to environment setup issues (missing `docutils`), Iâ€™ll provide an updated script which includes additional error handling and some setup instructions that ensure the necessary environment is prepared for running the script.

Before running the script, ensure you have both `docutils` and `sphinx` installed in your environment. You can install them using pip:

```shell
pip install sphinx docutils
```

Here is the restructured `reproducer.py` script:

```python
import os
import sys

def setup_environment():
    try:
        from sphinx.application import Sphinx
    except ImportError as import_error:
        print("Required module 'sphinx' is not installed. Trying to install it...", file=sys.stderr)
        os.system('pip install sphinx')
        from sphinx.application import Sphinx

    try:
        import docutils
    except ImportError as import_error:
        print("Required module 'docutils' is not installed. Trying to install it...", file=sys.stderr)
        os.system('pip install docutils')

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_files():
    index_content = """.. literalinclude:: example.xml
   :language: xml
   :prepend:       </plugin>
   :start-at: <groupId>com.example</groupId>
   :end-before: </plugin>"""

    xml_content = """<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>example-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
</project>"""

    with open("index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write(index_content)

    with open("example.xml", "w") as xml_file:
        xml_file.write(xml_content)

def build_sphinx():
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx

    config = {'extensions': [], 'project': 'Reproducer'}
    app = Sphinx(srcdir='.', confdir=None, outdir='_build/html', doctreedir='_build/doctrees', buildername="html", confoverrides=config)
    app.build()

def check_output():
    with open('_build/html/index.html', 'r') as html_file:
        content = html_file.read()
        expected_prepend_snippet = "      </plugin>"
        if expected_prepend_snippet not in content:
            raise AssertionError("The prepend snippet indentation does not match the expected indentation.")

def main():
    setup_environment()
    create_test_files()

    try:
        build_sphinx()
        check_output()
        print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Issue is present, please investigate further.")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is designed to first ensure the required Sphinx and docutils environments are set up properly. It proceeds to dynamically generate the necessary test files (`index.rst` and `example.xml`), mimics a minimal Sphinx build process, and verifies if the output matches the expectation regarding indentation. If the output is not as expected, indicating the presence of the issue, it raises an `AssertionError`; otherwise, it exits with code 0, signaling the issue is fixed.
