Specifically, we're interested in any changes introduced around the regression, as mentioned in #27515 and commit 5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13. Let's proceed with the following search API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `AuthenticationForm` class to understand its structure and the code.\n2. Within the `AuthenticationForm`, we need to examine how the username field is defined, including any methods that are involved in rendering or modifying this field.\n\nHere are the specific API calls to execute:\n\n- `search_class(\"AuthenticationForm\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"clean_username\", \"AuthenticationForm\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"AuthenticationForm\")`\n\nThese calls are designed to find the class definition and the specific methods that might contribute to setting attributes of the username field, including initialization and cleaning processes, which can be crucial for understanding how and where the `maxlength` attribute should be applied."
