Understand how the `groupby` method is implemented for `DataArray` objects.\n2. Find the implementation of the `mean` method on the object returned by the `DataArray.groupby()` call.\n\nFirst, let's look for the class definition of `DataArray` and see how the `groupby` method is implemented within it:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"DataArray\")\n```\n\nSecond, since the `groupby` method might not be directly defined within the `DataArray` class but could be inherited or mixed in from another class or module, I should also directly search for the `groupby` method in the entire codebase:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"groupby\")\n```\n\nNext, considering the `mean` method is likely called on the result of `DataArray.groupby()`, which typically returns a `GroupBy` object, it's necessary to find out how the `mean` method is defined on that specific result object:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GroupBy\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"mean\", \"GroupBy\")\n```\n\nThis approach should provide comprehensive context for understanding the issue's root cause and facilitating the development of an appropriate patch."
