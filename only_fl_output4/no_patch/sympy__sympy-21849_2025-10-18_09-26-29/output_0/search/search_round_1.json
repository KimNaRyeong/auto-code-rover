Search for the class `LambertW` to understand its structure and methods, as well as its relationship with other classes that might be relevant to this error:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"LambertW\")\n```\n\n2. Since the error mentions `_print_LambertW` receiving an unexpected keyword argument `exp`, let's find out where this method is defined.

Understanding how `Pow` expressions are handled in general, and specifically how they interact with the `LambertW` function in the LaTeX printer, might be key in solving this issue. To get a complete view, let's search for the `Pow` class definition:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Pow\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of how the `LambertW` function, power expressions, and their LaTeX representations are implemented in Sympy, pointing us towards the root cause of the issue and indicating how it might be resolved."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can understand the structure and behavior of `LambertW` and `Pow`, and how they are intended to be printed, especially in LaTeX. This analysis is crucial for addressing the bug described in the issue.\n\n### `LambertW` Analysis\n- **File:** `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`\n- **Behavior:** The `LambertW` class represents the Lambert W function in SymPy. The defined methods, such as `eval`, `fdiff`, `_eval_is_extended_real`, etc., suggest that it encapsulates properties relevant to symbolic manipulation and differentiation. However, from the issue description, the problem arises when trying to print `LambertW` instances, particularly when used in a `Pow` expression.\n- **Relationship to Bug:** The absence of details about printing mechanisms within the `LambertW` class definition hints that the bug might not stem from `LambertW` itself but how it interacts with the printing system, especially LaTeX rendering.\n\n### `_print_LambertW` Analysis\n- **Files:** Listed in various files, but relevant to us is `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n- **Behavior:** This method should be responsible for converting `LambertW` expressions into a LaTeX string. The issue arises because it receives an unexpected keyword argument `exp`.\n- **Relationship to Bug and Intended Behavior:** The bug report specifically mentions a `TypeError` because `_print_LambertW` does not expect an `exp` argument. `_print_LambertW` should ideally be able to handle `LambertW` objects regardless of their context (e.g., as standalone objects or part of expressions, like `Pow`).\n\n### `_print_Pow` Analysis\n- **Files:** Also in `sympy/printing/latex.py` among others\n- **Behavior:** This printer method handles exponentiation, including base and exponent parts. The `TypeError` in the bug report suggests that when `Pow` involves a `LambertW` function, `_print_Pow` incorrectly assumes that `_print_LambertW` can handle an `exp` argument.\n- **Relationship to Bug:** The core of the issue likely involves the interaction between `_print_Pow` and `_print_LambertW`, where `_print_Pow` expects `_print_LambertW` to accept an exponent argument (`exp`), which it does not. This miscommunication leads to a failure in rendering the LaTeX representation of the expression.\n\n### `Pow` Class Analysis\n- **File:** `sympy/core/power.py`\n- **Behavior:** `Pow` represents power expressions and provides a framework for handling properties and operations on exponentiation, including differentiation, evaluation, and simplification.\n- **Relationship to Bug:** While `Pow` itself is likely functioning as intended for symbolic manipulation, the issue arises when its instances involving `LambertW` are passed to the LaTeX printer. It indicates that `Pow`'s interaction with the LaTeX printing system (handled by `_print_Pow`), in conjunction with `LambertW`, needs reevaluation.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nGiven the relationship between `Pow` handling and LaTeX printing, the intended behavior should allow `Pow(LambertW(x), n)` to be correctly interpreted and rendered by `_print_LambertW` without raising a `TypeError` related to unexpected arguments. A potential patch could involve modifying `_print_Pow` or `_print_LambertW` in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to correctly handle this case. It might involve adding handling for `exp` within `_print_LambertW` or amending `_print_Pow` to not pass `exp` to `_print_LambertW`.\n\nTo further this analysis, the next step would be to inspect the relevant sections of `sympy/printing/latex.py` where `_print_LambertW` and `_print_Pow` are implemented. Specifically, the code snippets where these methods are defined will provide insights into why `_print_Pow` passes an `exp` argument and how to adjust the implementation to resolve the issue.\n\n### Suggested API Calls for Next Steps\n1. **Inspect Implementation of `_print_LambertW` in `latex.py`:**\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_print_LambertW\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Inspect Implementation of `_print_Pow` in `latex.py`:**\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_print_Pow\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to directly investigate the implementation details tied to the bug's occurrence."

One way to achieve this could be to check if the base of the `Pow` expression is a `LambertW` function and handle the exponent part within `_print_Pow` without expecting `_print_LambertW` to accept an `exp` keyword. This behavior would allow for the correct rendering of the LaTeX representation of expressions like `sp.LambertW(x)**n` or similar constructs involving `LambertW` inside a `Pow` expression.\n\n   **Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** `_print_LambertW`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** While the primary issue seems to reside within `_print_Pow`, if `_print_LambertW` is to be modified, it should either be made to accept and properly handle an `exp` keyword argument or ensure that such a scenario is managed upstream (e.g., in `_print_Pow`). However, based on standard handling of function printing and consistency across the codebase, modifying `_print_LambertW` to accept `exp` directly may not be the best approach unless it aligns with how other function printers handle similar situations. The intended correction should ensure that any changes preserve existing functionality for all other cases where `_print_LambertW` is used, maintaining the integrity and usability of the printing system for `LambertW` expressions outside of `Pow` contexts."
