One way to achieve this could be to check if the base of the `Pow` expression is a `LambertW` function and handle the exponent part within `_print_Pow` without expecting `_print_LambertW` to accept an `exp` keyword. This behavior would allow for the correct rendering of the LaTeX representation of expressions like `sp.LambertW(x)**n` or similar constructs involving `LambertW` inside a `Pow` expression."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary issue seems to reside within `_print_Pow`, if `_print_LambertW` is to be modified, it should either be made to accept and properly handle an `exp` keyword argument or ensure that such a scenario is managed upstream (e.g., in `_print_Pow`). However, based on standard handling of function printing and consistency across the codebase, modifying `_print_LambertW` to accept `exp` directly may not be the best approach unless it aligns with how other function printers handle similar situations. The intended correction should ensure that any changes preserve existing functionality for all other cases where `_print_LambertW` is used, maintaining the integrity and usability of the printing system for `LambertW` expressions outside of `Pow` contexts."
