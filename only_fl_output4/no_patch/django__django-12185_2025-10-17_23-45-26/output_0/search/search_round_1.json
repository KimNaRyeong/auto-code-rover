        "content": "To properly address the issue described, we need to gather more context about where and how Django handles window expressions and conditional statements (specifically `Case` and `When`) within annotations in querysets. The key areas of interest are how Django preprocesses and validates queryset annotations and how window expressions are managed, especially in the context of the SELECT clause.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the following:\n\n1. The implementation of the `Window` expression, where it's defined and how it's processed. This requires examining the class definition and relevant methods.\n2. The handling of conditional expressions like `Case` and `When` within query annotations.\n3. Validation or execution logic that might be mistakenly disallowing window functions in the SELECT clause, potentially in the ORM or query compilation phase.\n\nStarting with these considerations, I propose the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Window` Expression Class**: Since window expressions are central to the issue, understanding its implementation could provide insights.\n   - `search_class(\"Window\")`\n\n2. **Search for `Case` and `When` Class Implementations**: These are used within the annotation to create conditional expressions.\n   - `search_class(\"Case\")`\n   - `search_class(\"When\")`\n\n3. **Search for Method Implementations Relevant to Query Compilation**: This includes methods that might compile or validate annotations in SELECT clauses, potentially where window functions are checked.\n   - `search_method(\"compile\")`\n   - `search_method(\"validate\")`\n\n4. **Search for any Code Snippets Referencing Window Functions in Annotations**: This can help understand how Django typically expects these to be handled.\n   - `search_code(\"Window(expression=\")`\n\n5. **Search Code for References to Conditional Expressions in Select Clauses**: Looking for direct usage might highlight areas where the issue originates.\n   - `search_code(\"Case(When(\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context around the handling of window expressions and conditional logic within Django's ORM, focusing on areas that might contribute to the reported issue."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address each piece separately:\n\n### Window Class (in `django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Window` class defines a SQL window function in Django, providing functionality for over clauses which allow for advanced aggregate operations such as computing moving averages, cumulative totals, or accessing the value of a preceding row. These operations are applied over a specified range of data defined by `partition_by` and `order_by` arguments.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue describes Django raising a `NotSupportedError` when using window functions in conditional statements in the `SELECT` clause. Given that the `Window` class is central to defining window expressions, the implementation here may enforce or relate to this limitation.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would allow the use of window functions within `SELECT` clause conditionals without raising errors, as it doesn't contradict SQL standards. There may be validation logic in this class or related processing methods that incorrectly restricts this usage.\n\n### Case and When Classes (in `django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - The `Case` and `When` classes allow for conditional expressions in queries, analogous to SQL's `CASE` statement. They enable executing conditions within queries and returning values based on these conditions.\n\n2. **What is their relationship with the bug?**\n   - The bug involves using a `Window` expression within a `Case` statement in the `SELECT` clause. Understanding how `Case` and `When` expressions handle or integrate with `Window` expressions can be key to identifying the source of the `NotSupportedError`.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of these parts of the code?**\n   - These classes should support the inclusion of window expressions in their conditions without raising errors. This suggests that there might be a need to adjust their validation or rendering logic to accommodate window expressions properly.\n\n### Compile and Validate Methods\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - The `compile` methods likely transform Django query expressions into SQL queries, while `validate` methods enforce constraints and rules about the structure and compatibility of fields and expressions within queries.\n\n2. **What is their relationship with the bug?**\n   - If the validation or compilation process mistakenly treats window expressions within select clause conditionals as invalid, these methods could be where the unsupported behavior is enforced.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of these parts of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `compile` and `validate` methods should allow for the correct interpretation and validation of window expressions when used within `Case` statements in the `SELECT` clause.\n\n### Failed Searches\n\nThe failure to find `Window(expression=` in the codebase might indicate that a more detailed or differently targeted search is necessary. It could be helpful to look into the implementation details of the `Window` class methods (`as_sql` could be interesting) or how Django's ORM constructs the query from these expression objects.\n\n### Lookup Class Usage of Case(When( (in `django/db/models/lookups.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This snippet shows an adaptation of an `Exists` query into a Boolean conditional expression within an Oracle-specific lookup method, demonstrating a practical use of `Case` and `When` for conditional logic.\n\n2. **What is its relationship with the bug?**\n   - It exemplifies the flexible use of conditional expressions (`Case` and `When`) within the Django ORM, indirectly related to the bug by showcasing how conditionals can enhance query capabilities.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code according to the issue?**\n   - While this snippet doesn't directly impact the bug, it suggests that the framework supports complex conditional logic. Extending this flexibility to include window functions within these constructs without raising errors aligns with the intended behavior.\n\nGiven this context, potential next steps involve looking deeper into:\n- The implementation details within `Window`, especially methods like `as_sql` or those handling validation or compilation, to see if the limitation is explicitly enforced.\n- How `Case` and `When` integrate with or process `Window` expressions, possibly requiring adjustments or clarifications in documentation if the support exists but is improperly utilized.\n- Updates or patches to related ORM and query construction code that might have inadvertently introduced this regression."

The `Window` class's methods that contribute to generating the SQL query, specifically `as_sql`, potentially enforce or are involved in the logic that leads to the `NotSupportedError` when a `Window` expression is used within a `Case` statement in a `SELECT` clause. The intended behavior should include a validation or compilation pathway that recognizes and correctly handles `Window` expressions when used in such a context, properly generating the SQL without raising errors, ensuring that the use of window functions in `SELECT` clause conditionals is supported as per SQL standards.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `django/db/models/expressions.py`, Classes: `Case` and `When`. While not explicitly buggy based on the provided context, these classes may require adjustments or extensions to their methods (`resolve_expression`, `as_sql`) to explicitly accommodate or better integrate with `Window` expressions used within them. The intended behavior would ensure that `Case` and `When` expressions can encapsulate `Window` expressions without issue, propagating the necessary context or flags to successfully compile the SQL query.\n\nBy addressing these locations, the aim is to preserve existing functionality\u2014allowing conditional expressions and window functions to independently function as expected\u2014while extending support to cover the use case described in the issue, where window functions are used within conditional expressions in the `SELECT` clause."
