        "content": "To properly address the issue described, we need to gather more context about where and how Django handles window expressions and conditional statements (specifically `Case` and `When`) within annotations in querysets. The key areas of interest are how Django preprocesses and validates queryset annotations and how window expressions are managed, especially in the context of the SELECT clause.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it seems pertinent to look into the following:\n\n1. The implementation of the `Window` expression, where it's defined and how it's processed. This requires examining the class definition and relevant methods.\n2. The handling of conditional expressions like `Case` and `When` within query annotations.\n3. Validation or execution logic that might be mistakenly disallowing window functions in the SELECT clause, potentially in the ORM or query compilation phase.\n\nStarting with these considerations, I propose the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Window` Expression Class**: Since window expressions are central to the issue, understanding its implementation could provide insights.\n   - `search_class(\"Window\")`\n\n2. **Search for `Case` and `When` Class Implementations**: These are used within the annotation to create conditional expressions.\n   - `search_class(\"Case\")`\n   - `search_class(\"When\")`\n\n3. **Search for Method Implementations Relevant to Query Compilation**: This includes methods that might compile or validate annotations in SELECT clauses, potentially where window functions are checked.\n   - `search_method(\"compile\")`\n   - `search_method(\"validate\")`\n\n4. **Search for any Code Snippets Referencing Window Functions in Annotations**: This can help understand how Django typically expects these to be handled.\n   - `search_code(\"Window(expression=\")`\n\n5. **Search Code for References to Conditional Expressions in Select Clauses**: Looking for direct usage might highlight areas where the issue originates.\n   - `search_code(\"Case(When(\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context around the handling of window expressions and conditional logic within Django's ORM, focusing on areas that might contribute to the reported issue."
