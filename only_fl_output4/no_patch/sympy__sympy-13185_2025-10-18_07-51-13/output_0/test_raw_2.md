Given your requirements to accurately reproduce the initially described scenario and validate the issue with SymPy's `cse()` regarding `MatrixSymbol` indexing, here is a revised standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is specifically designed to check for the unexpected behavior observed: `x0` and `x2` being assigned the entirety of matrices `a` and `b`, which should not happen under normal circumstances.

```python
import sympy as sp
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sub_in_matrixsymbols(exp, matrices):
    for matrix in matrices:
        for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
            for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
                name = "%s_%d_%d" % (matrix.name, i, j)
                sym = sp.symbols(name)
                exp = exp.subs(sym, matrix[i, j])
    return exp

def t44(name):
    return sp.Matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: sp.symbols('%s_%d_%d' % (name, i, j)))

def main():
    try:
        # Construct symbolic matrices
        a = t44("a")
        b = t44("b")

        # Symbolic multiplication
        e = a * b

        # Substitute matrix symbols
        e2 = sub_in_matrixsymbols(e, [sp.MatrixSymbol("a", 4, 4), sp.MatrixSymbol("b", 4, 4)])
        
        # Common Subexpression Elimination
        cse_subs, cse_reduced = sp.cse(e2)

        # Check for incorrect handling of matrices as single entries
        for sym, expr in cse_subs:
            if isinstance(expr, sp.MatrixElement):
                if expr.parent in [a, b]:
                    raise AssertionError("cse() incorrectly processed MatrixSymbols as single entries.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print("Issue with cse() for MatrixSymbol indexing not detected or has been fixed.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script follows your initial outline more precisely, performing common subexpression elimination on a symbolic matrix multiplication operation. If `cse()` processes the matrix symbols `a` and `b` incorrectly as single entries leading to unexpected results, the script raises an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, it concludes the issue is either not present or has been resolved. This approach directly targets the behavior observed in your example, making it a suitable test for checking the specified issue.
