        "intended_behavior": "The `cse` method should correctly handle expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` objects. Specifically, it should efficiently recognize common subexpressions within matrix operations without unnecessary duplication or misinterpretation of matrix symbols as individual expressions. This might involve refining how expressions are decomposed and recomposed in the context of matrix algebra, ensuring `MatrixSymbol`'s unique properties and indexing are respected. The fix should preserve `cse`'s ability to simplify complex expressions across different types of sympy objects while enhancing its understanding of matrix symbols and operations."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be reviewed to ensure it properly facilitates substitutions within `MatrixSymbol` objects, especially in contexts where these objects are processed through the `cse` function. Improvements might include ensuring that the substitution logic within `MatrixSymbol` is fully compatible with the assumptions and requirements of the `cse` process, particularly in avoiding unnecessary replication of matrix content when `MatrixSymbol` instances are substituted. The behavior should ensure that matrix elements can be individually targeted for substitution without affecting the integrity or expected functionality of the matrix as a whole."
