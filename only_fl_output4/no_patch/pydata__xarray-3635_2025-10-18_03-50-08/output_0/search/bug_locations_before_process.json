        "intended_behavior": "This method is intended to calculate the quantile values of the data array it is called on, aligning with numpy's percentile calculation via the `np.nanpercentile` function. The issue arises due to the mismatch in the expected range of quantile values between xarray (which expects a range of [0, 1]) and numpy's percentile range ([0, 100]). To resolve the issue, the method should:\n\n- Prior to calling `np.nanpercentile`, validate the range of the input `q` to ensure it falls within the [0, 1] interval expected by xarray. If `q` does not fall within this range, raise a `ValueError` with a corrected message stating `\"Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]\"` to align with xarray's expected input, rather than leaning on numpy's error message which may cause confusion.\n\n- Ensure this validation mechanism does not impact the method's ability to correctly calculate and return quantile values when provided with valid input.\n\n- This change retains the method's existing functionality while providing clearer guidance to the user on the expected input range, thus directly addressing the reported issue."
