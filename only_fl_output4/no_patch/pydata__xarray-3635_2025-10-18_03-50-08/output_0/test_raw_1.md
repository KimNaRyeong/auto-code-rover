Given the constraints and the specific request, here's the corrected approach to create a standalone python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is tailored to address the initial problem surrounding the `xarray.DataArray.quantile()` method and the error message it produces regarding quantile ranges. 

The original intention was to reproduce the issue where the error message incorrectly states the required range of quantiles as `[0, 100]` instead of `[0, 1]`. However, the environment or other unexpected issues interfered with the execution in the previous setup. Let's create a focused and accurate script to address the original concern directly.

```python
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_xarray_quantile_error_message():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])
        da.quantile(q=50)  # This should raise a ValueError
    except ValueError as e:
        correct_message = "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]"
        if str(e) == correct_message:
            print("Correct exception message received.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 for correct behavior
        else:
            print(f"Incorrect exception message:\nExpected: {correct_message}\nReceived: {str(e)}", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for incorrect behavior
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  

    print("No exception was raised, but a ValueError was expected.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 because the expected error did not occur

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_xarray_quantile_error_message()
```

This script refines the goal of capturing and assessing the error message for the `xarray.DataArray.quantile()` method. When executed in an environment where the specific version of xarray exhibits the reported issue, it directly tests for the specific error handling and message content, exiting with code 0 only if the current behavior matches the expected corrected behavior of displaying an error message that quantiles must be in the range `[0, 1]`.
