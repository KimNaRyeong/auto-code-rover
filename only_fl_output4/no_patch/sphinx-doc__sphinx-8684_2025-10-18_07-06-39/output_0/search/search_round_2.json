Since the issue mentions extending the behavior of `:dedent:` to act like Python's `textwrap.dedent`, and there were no direct hits, it's possible that the feature isn't implemented explicitly under those names or it's managed differently.\n\nConsidering this, we should focus on where `:dedent:` would be likely used or parsed, such as in documentation processing or in directives handling where Sphinx or a similar system might be involved. The directives `code-block` and `literalinclude` are key, so I will:\n\n1. **Search for classes or methods handling directives**: Specifically, these would be involved in parsing or applying settings to blocks of code in documentation.\n\n2. **Look closely at documentation processing components**: Since the feature request pertains to how documentation is written and processed, there might be specific components or utilities that handle text formatting that we haven't identified yet.\n\nHence, the adjusted API calls could include searching for classes or methods that are likely to be involved in the handling of documentation directives or blocks:\n\n1. search_method_in_class(\"visit_literal_block\", \"Directive\")\n2. search_class(\"Directive\")\n3. search_method(\"parse_directive_options\")\n4. search_code(\"code-block\")\n5. search_code(\"literalinclude\")\n\nThese calls are designed to explore areas related to the documentation processing mechanism and how `:dedent:` might be integrated into the parsing or rendering of code blocks and included literals."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since direct searches for `:dedent:` or a `dedent` method yielded no results, and without actual search API outcomes to analyze, here's a speculative approach on potential bug locations and intended behaviors based on common practices in similar systems:\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**\n  - **File:** Not specified from API results.\n  - **Class:** Directive or a class handling the `code-block` directive.\n  - **Method:** Possibly a method that parses or applies options to `code-block`.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Extend the existing method or create a new method to automatically detect and apply dedentation based on the least indented line in the content, when no specific `:dedent:` value is provided. This matches the behavior of Python's `textwrap.dedent`. Dedentation should apply uniformly across all lines in the block.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** Not specified from API results.\n  - **Class:** Directive or a class handling the `literalinclude` directive.\n  - **Method:** Possibly a method that parses or applies options to `literalinclude`.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly, extend the existing method or create a new one to apply automatic dedentation based on the content's least indentation level for `literalinclude` when no `:dedent:` value is given. Ensure that the dedentation is applied uniformly to maintain the integrity of the included code's structure.\n\nWithout specific codebase insights, the suggested approach focuses on enhancing or creating methods within the classes responsible for handling `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives. These enhancements should recognize when `:dedent:` is applied without a specific value and then apply dedentation to the entire block, ensuring that no leading whitespace characters are left in the least indented line of the block, thus preserving the structural integrity of the code while making it more readable and consistent with Python\u2019s `textwrap.dedent` behavior."

This requires a broader set of API calls based on the speculative nature of the previous suggestions. Unfortunately, without immediate search data, pinpointing exact files or classes wasn't possible. Let's gather more context through a different set of API calls aimed at locating components likely involved in parsing and rendering these directives.\n\n1. search_code(\"code-block\")\n2. search_code(\"literalinclude\")\n3. search_class(\"Directive\")\n4. search_method(\"parse_directive_options\")\n\nThis set of API calls should help identify the system's mechanism for handling `code-block` and `literalinclude`, possibly giving us direct insights into where the `:dedent:` logic could be integrated or extended according to the issue description."
