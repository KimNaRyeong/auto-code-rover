This dedentation should remove an amount of leading whitespace from each line equal to the smallest indentation level found among all lines in the block. This behavior should mimic Python's `textwrap.dedent`, ensuring that the code within the documentation is as readable as possible without unnecessary indentation."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, modify the `LiteralInclude` class to support automatic dedentation when the `:dedent:` option is utilized without an explicit value. The logic should analyze the indentation of the included file or code snippet, dedent based on the least indented line, and apply this uniformly across the included content. This enhancement will make externally included code snippets align neatly with the documentation's formatting standards, enhancing readability."
