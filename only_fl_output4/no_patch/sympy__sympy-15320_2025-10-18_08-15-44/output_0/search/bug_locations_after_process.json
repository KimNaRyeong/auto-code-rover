        "intended_behavior": "The `RootOf.__new__` method should ensure that when a transformed expression (e.g., via `.subs({x: tan(x)})`) is passed to it, it correctly recognizes and processes the new generator (in the example, `tan(x)` instead of `x`). This involves appropriately identifying and handling generator substitutions to ensure that the polynomial's representation within `RootOf` accurately reflects any changes to its variables or expressions. This might require extending the method to more thoroughly analyze the input expression for generator changes, potentially leveraging additional polynomial properties or SymPy's capabilities to trace and incorporate these transformations."
