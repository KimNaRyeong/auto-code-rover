On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

Not much about logging specifics was directly revealed from the provided details.\n    - Its relationship to the bug seems to be on the logging end\u2014specifically, the inconsistency in how it logs, possibly missing the provision of `server_time`.\n    - Intended behavior would likely involve aligning its logging mechanism with that of `WSGIRequestHandler` or universally applying a consistent datetime format, possibly through adjustments in initialization or error handling methods to include a standardized time format.\n\n3. **ServerFormatter**:\n    - A logging formatter class that presumably formats log messages for the server.\n    - It's directly related to the issue as it contains a `format` method, which might be where the discrepancy in datetime formats occurs (`formatTime` being used here).\n    - The intended behavior would be to ensure this formatter uses a consistent datetime format across all log messages, potentially by making the datetime format customizable or unified.\n\nGiven the absence of results for `%(server_time)s` and `%(asctime)s`, these placeholders may not be directly referenced in the codebase, suggesting the logging configuration might be defined elsewhere or these tokens are part of a default or external configuration not captured by the search. Possibly, the configuration for these formats is dynamic or set in a way that wasn't directly captured by simple code search.\n\nTo further progress towards addressing the issue, I suggest:\n\n1. Looking into the `log_message` method of `WSGIRequestHandler` to understand exactly how it formats log messages.\n2. Exploring the initialization (`__init__`) method of `WSGIServer` to find any logging configuration that it applies.\n3. Investigating the `format` method of `ServerFormatter` to see how it decides on the format to use and if it directly accesses or modifies the datetime format.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be useful:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"log_message\", \"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"WSGIServer\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"format\", \"ServerFormatter\")`"

One approach to resolve the issue could be to directly format the log message with `%(asctime)s` (or a comparable, consistent timestamp format) that's broadly adopted across the server's logging system. Additionally, ensure that the timestamp format is configurable to accommodate different use cases or preferences.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n  - Class: `WSGIServer`\n  - Method: `__init__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** During the server initialization, ensure that the logging configuration aligns with whatever format `WSGIRequestHandler` uses or adopts a universally consistent logging format. This may involve setting a default format that uses `%(asctime)s` for timestamp information and ensuring that this format is used wherever server log messages are generated. It\u2019s crucial that these configurations are flexible to allow for custom formats.\n\n- **Bug Location 3:**\n  - File: `django/utils/log.py`\n  - Class: `ServerFormatter`\n  - Method: `format`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `format` method should either be adapted to make `server_time` consistent with `asctime` or fully transition to using `asctime` for the sake of consistency and configurability. It should ensure that all log messages passing through here adhere to a unified timestamp format. The class might also need a method or a mechanism to configure the datetime format, providing a way to easily customize how timestamps are presented in logs, aligning with the customization mentioned in the original issue description."
