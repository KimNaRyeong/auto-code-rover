However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Django processes the filenames in multipart/form-data requests, particularly in the context of the `MultiPartParser` class or its related methods. The issue mentions that this functionality does not properly handle filenames wrapped in double quotes, resulting in an incorrect filename being parsed. The problem is specifically highlighted when using tools like PostmanCanary that include the filename in double quotes. Based on the description, we are looking for how Django's parsing differs from CPython's handling of similar cases, and we might need to review how compatibility is addressed in CPython as per the issue's suggestion.\n\nGiven this information, our strategy will involve several steps to understand and eventually resolve this issue:\n1. **Identify how Django parses multipart forms and handles filenames.** This will likely involve the `MultiPartParser` class or similar areas in Django's codebase where file uploads are processed.\n2. **Compare with CPython's method of handling filenames in multipart forms**, specifically how special cases like filenames enclosed in double quotes are managed. This reference to CPython handling might point us towards a solution that could be adapted or mirrored in Django.\n\nThus, the search might involve the following API calls:\n- Look for the `MultiPartParser` class in Django's codebase as the issue seems to be around how multipart form data is parsed by Django.\n- Identify methods or code segments involved in parsing and handling filenames in the multipart forms, especially those that might strip or work around quotes.\n\nLet's formulate the API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")`: This will help locate the `MultiPartParser` class in the Django codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")`: We're interested in how parsing is done, specifically looking for a method that might be responsible for handling file data, including filenames.\n3. `search_code(\"filename=\\\"\")`: Since the issue is specifically about filenames wrapped in double quotes, searching for code snippets that handle such cases could reveal current handling or lack thereof.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand how filename parsing is currently implemented and guide the path towards addressing the compatibility issue mentioned."

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context, let's address the core aspects and their relation to the described issue:\n\n### 1. `MultiPartParser` Class Code Analysis\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `MultiPartParser` class in Django is responsible for parsing multipart form data from the HTTP request. This class differentiates between file data and non-file data, populating the `FILES` and `POST` dictionaries respectively. The parsing process involves:\n- Interpreting the multipart data stream using handlers,\n- Handling complete files through `handle_file_complete`,\n- Sanitizing file names (e.g., for Internet Explorer),\n- Managing data size limits for both memory and number of fields,\n- Correctly decoding data, with special treatment for base64 encoded file content.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe bug report mentions an issue where filenames wrapped in double quotes by multipart form data (e.g., as produced by certain tools like PostmanCanary) are not correctly handled, resulting in the filename retaining a trailing double quote. The parsing logic, specifically where filenames are extracted and sanitized (lines 209-213), is directly related to this issue. Double quotes are not explicitly managed here, leading to the observed problem.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be to correctly parse and sanitize the filename, removing any surrounding double quotes. This would involve modifying the filename extraction and sanitization logic to detect and strip double quotes at the beginning and end of the filename string, ensuring compatibility with multipart form data sources that include such quotes.\n\n### 2. Snippets Containing `filename=`\n\nWhile the search for `filename=\\\"` across the codebase returned matches in various files unrelated to multipart parsing (`response.py`, `storage.py`, `base.py`, `message.py`), it underlines the general handling of filenames in different contexts within Django. These contexts, however, are not directly related to the parsing of multipart form data and hence have a tangential relationship with the bug.\n\n### Next Steps for Analysis or Patch Development\n\nGiven the information at hand, a direct patch would involve the `MultiPartParser.parse` method, specifically enhancing the filename handling logic around lines 209-213. The patch would entail:\n- Detecting and stripping double quotes from the `file_name` after it has been subjected to encoding and sanitization functions.\n- Ensuring this handling does not inadvertently affect other forms of encoding or escaping that may be legitimately part of the filename.\n\nThis analysis points towards a focused modification within the `MultiPartParser` logic as the immediate next step to address the described issue."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The intended behavior here is to ensure that any leading and trailing double quotes around the filename are properly stripped after the filename is extracted and before any sanitization or further processing is performed. This change must preserve the existing functionality of handling file names, ensuring that filenames with legitimate double quotes as part of their content are not improperly modified. This requires careful consideration to avoid stripping internal quotes or affecting escape sequences.\n\nThe exact change would involve:\n- Implementing logic to check for and remove leading and trailing double quotes (`\"`) from the `file_name` variable.\n- This logic should only apply to the outermost quotes to ensure filenames with quotes within them are not affected.\n\nThis change aims to address compatibility with third-party tools that encapsulate filename parameters in double quotes, aligning with the observed behavior in tools like PostmanCanary without breaking the existing filename handling conventions within Django."
