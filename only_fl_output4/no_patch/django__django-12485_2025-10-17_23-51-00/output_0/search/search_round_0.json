However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Django processes the filenames in multipart/form-data requests, particularly in the context of the `MultiPartParser` class or its related methods. The issue mentions that this functionality does not properly handle filenames wrapped in double quotes, resulting in an incorrect filename being parsed. The problem is specifically highlighted when using tools like PostmanCanary that include the filename in double quotes. Based on the description, we are looking for how Django's parsing differs from CPython's handling of similar cases, and we might need to review how compatibility is addressed in CPython as per the issue's suggestion.\n\nGiven this information, our strategy will involve several steps to understand and eventually resolve this issue:\n1. **Identify how Django parses multipart forms and handles filenames.** This will likely involve the `MultiPartParser` class or similar areas in Django's codebase where file uploads are processed.\n2. **Compare with CPython's method of handling filenames in multipart forms**, specifically how special cases like filenames enclosed in double quotes are managed. This reference to CPython handling might point us towards a solution that could be adapted or mirrored in Django.\n\nThus, the search might involve the following API calls:\n- Look for the `MultiPartParser` class in Django's codebase as the issue seems to be around how multipart form data is parsed by Django.\n- Identify methods or code segments involved in parsing and handling filenames in the multipart forms, especially those that might strip or work around quotes.\n\nLet's formulate the API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")`: This will help locate the `MultiPartParser` class in the Django codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")`: We're interested in how parsing is done, specifically looking for a method that might be responsible for handling file data, including filenames.\n3. `search_code(\"filename=\\\"\")`: Since the issue is specifically about filenames wrapped in double quotes, searching for code snippets that handle such cases could reveal current handling or lack thereof.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand how filename parsing is currently implemented and guide the path towards addressing the compatibility issue mentioned."
