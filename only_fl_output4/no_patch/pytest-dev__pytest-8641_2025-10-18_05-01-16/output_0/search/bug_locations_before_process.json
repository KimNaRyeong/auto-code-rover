        "intended_behavior": "The `LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX` should be updated to correctly handle precision specifiers in the format string for `levelname`. This change must enable the regex to match and extract log level names from format strings that include precision specifications (e.g., `5.5s` for a maximum field width of 5 characters and a precision of 5). The regex adjustment should ensure that color formatting can still be applied to log level names, even when these detailed precision specifiers are present. The modification should maintain compatibility with common log format specifications and not interfere with the existing capabilities of the `ColoredLevelFormatter` class to colorize output based on log level severity. The updated regex could look something like ``r\"%\\(levelname\\)([+-.]?\\d*(?:\\.\\d+)?[diufeEs])\"` to include support for precision while also considering different format specifiers that might be used with `levelname`."
