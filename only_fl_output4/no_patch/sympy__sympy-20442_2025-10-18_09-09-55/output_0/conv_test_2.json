Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"

Since importing `joule` directly from `sympy` was incorrect, we can use units from `sympy.physics.units` where needed. Here is the adjusted script that should properly attempt to reproduce the reported issue and follow your guidelines for error handling and reporting.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joules, seconds\nfrom sympy.physics.units import kilogram as kg, meter as m\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    J = joules  # Correct unit for joules\n    s = seconds  # Correct unit for seconds\n\n    # The problematic conversion\n    try:\n        result = convert_to(J*s, J)\n        # We expect the result to be Joule*second or something meaningful, not joule**(7/9)\n        assert result == J*s, f\"Unexpected conversion result: {result}\"\n        print(\"Issue not reproduced, conversion worked as expected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise e  # To ensure non-zero exit code if the issue is present\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Ensure script exits with error code for any unexpected error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        main()\n    except AssertionError:\n        # If an AssertionError is caught, it means the issue has been reproduced.\n        # Exiting with 0 as per instructions for when the issue is present.\n        exit(0)\n    except Exception:\n        # For any other kind of exception, exit with 1 indicating failure to run correctly.\n        exit(1)\n```\n\nThis script properly initializes `joules` and `seconds` from `sympy.physics.units`, which should correct the import error you encountered. Furthermore, it aims to raise an `AssertionError` if the conversion does not yield the expected result, thus reproducing the described issue if it still exists. The error handling and stack trace printing functionalities are implemented as requested, facilitating troubleshooting in the event of failure."
