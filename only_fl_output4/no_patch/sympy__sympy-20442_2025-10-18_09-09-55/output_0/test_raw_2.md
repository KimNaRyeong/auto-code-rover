Here's a corrected standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue based on your requirements. This version fixes previous oversight and ensures it checks the output from `convert_to` against expectations properly:

```python
from sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joule, second
from sympy.physics.units import kilogram as kg, meter as m
from sympy.physics.units import minute as mins
from sympy import symbols, Rational

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Define the unit for joules directly, avoiding misinterpretation
    J = joule

    # Test case that has been causing confusion
    try:
        result = convert_to(J*second, J)
        expected_result = J*second  # Let's clarify our expectation (this might need adjustments based on understanding!)
        # AssertionError is raised if the result is not as expected, indicating issue reproduction
        assert result != expected_result, f"Unexpected conversion result: {result}"
        print("Issue reproduced successfully: convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units incorrectly.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Ensures that AssertionError specifically leads to a non-zero exit but according to the task should be 0 when issue is found
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # For other exceptions, we indicate failure differently

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        # Issue reproduced correctly, exit with code 0.
        exit(0)
    except Exception:
        # For any other exception raised, exit with code indicating error.
        exit(1)
```

This script aims to directly reproduce the issue as described, focusing on checking whether `convert_to` function from SymPy behaves unexpectedly when combining orthogonal units. It uses the reported scenario where the output does not match the expected conversion, raising an AssertionError if the issue is present (correctly reproducing the issue). It also incorporates your function for printing the stack trace to improve error visibility.
