Given the behavior described in the issue, it seems there might be a problem with how the function handles the conversion logic or interprets unit expressions.\n\nHere are the necessary API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"convert_to\")`: This call is essential to locate the `convert_to` function within the project and understand its implementation details.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Quantity\")`: Since the issue involves unit conversion, it's likely that a class dealing with quantities or units (like \"Quantity\") might have a significant role. This call helps to find such a class if it exists.\n\n3. `search_code(\"joule*second,joule\")`: This call aims to find how the specific example given in the issue is handled or if any similar conversion examples are specifically addressed in the codebase.\n\n4. `search_code(\"kg*m**2/s**2\")`: Since the fundamental issue seems to relate to how unit expressions are parsed or converted, finding code related to the definition or manipulation of units like `kg*m**2/s**2` might provide additional insights.\n\nThese API calls should furnish the necessary context around the issue's description, the implementation of the `convert_to` function, and the handling of unit expressions within the project."
