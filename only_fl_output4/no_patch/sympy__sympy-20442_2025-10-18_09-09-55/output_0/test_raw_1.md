Certainly! Let's correct the script considering the import error for 'joule'. Since importing `joule` directly from `sympy` was incorrect, we can use units from `sympy.physics.units` where needed. Here is the adjusted script that should properly attempt to reproduce the reported issue and follow your guidelines for error handling and reporting.

```python
from sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joules, seconds
from sympy.physics.units import kilogram as kg, meter as m

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    J = joules  # Correct unit for joules
    s = seconds  # Correct unit for seconds

    # The problematic conversion
    try:
        result = convert_to(J*s, J)
        # We expect the result to be Joule*second or something meaningful, not joule**(7/9)
        assert result == J*s, f"Unexpected conversion result: {result}"
        print("Issue not reproduced, conversion worked as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # To ensure non-zero exit code if the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure script exits with error code for any unexpected error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        # If an AssertionError is caught, it means the issue has been reproduced.
        # Exiting with 0 as per instructions for when the issue is present.
        exit(0)
    except Exception:
        # For any other kind of exception, exit with 1 indicating failure to run correctly.
        exit(1)
```

This script properly initializes `joules` and `seconds` from `sympy.physics.units`, which should correct the import error you encountered. Furthermore, it aims to raise an `AssertionError` if the conversion does not yield the expected result, thus reproducing the described issue if it still exists. The error handling and stack trace printing functionalities are implemented as requested, facilitating troubleshooting in the event of failure.
