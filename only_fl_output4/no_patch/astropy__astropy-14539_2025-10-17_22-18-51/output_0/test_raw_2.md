Based on your instructions, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` Python script that should raise an `AssertionError` when the specified issue (incorrect behavior of `io.fits.FITSDiff` with identical files) is present, using the correct `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error reporting. This script will exit with code 0 only when the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_issue():
    from astropy.io import fits

    # Generate a FITS file with a Variable Length Array (VLA)
    col = fits.Column(name='a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
    hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
    filename = 'diffbug.fits'
    hdu.writeto(filename, overwrite=True)

    # Use FITSDiff to check for differences
    diff = fits.FITSDiff(filename, filename)
    identical = diff.identical

    if not identical:
        e = AssertionError("FITSDiff reports differences between identical files.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Raise AssertionError if the issue is present

    # If no differences are found, it means the issue is fixed or doesn't occur
    print("The files are reported as identical by FITSDiff, no issue detected.")
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit_code = check_for_issue()
    exit(exit_code)
```

This script performs the following actions:
1. It defines `print_stacktrace()` to properly report errors with detailed context information.
2. In the `check_for_issue()` function:
   - It creates a simple FITS file with a specific structure intended to reproduce the bug.
   - Then, it uses `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff` to compare the file with itself, checking if it incorrectly reports any differences.
   - If such behavior is detected (indicating the bug's presence), it raises an `AssertionError` and uses the `print_stacktrace()` function to highlight this.
3. Finally, the script will only exit with code `0` (indicating success/no error) if no issue is detected.

Please ensure that the necessary Python packages (`astropy` and dependencies) are installed in your environment before running this script.
