This script `reproducer.py` is designed to be a standalone Python script that you can place at the root directory of your project and run with Python 3. When the issue described (i.e., `io.fits.FITSDiff` reports differences between identical files due to potentially improper handling of VLAs) is present, this script will catch the `AssertionError` thrown by `reproduce_issue` when `FITSDiff` incorrectly reports differences between identical VLAs. It will then use `print_stacktrace` to print a detailed stack trace, including the line numbers where the error occurred. This will make it easier to diagnose and fix the issue. 

Remember, the script exits with code 0 by default if there are no exceptions.

Also, please ensure that Astropy and its dependencies are properly installed in your Python environment for this script to run successfully.
