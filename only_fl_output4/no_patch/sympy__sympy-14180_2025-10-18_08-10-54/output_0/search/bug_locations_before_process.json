        "intended_behavior": "This method should include specific handling for the `ln` function to ensure that it is converted to `\\ln` in the LaTeX representation, not as `log`. The modification should check if the function being printed is the natural logarithm `ln` and, if so, output the LaTeX code specifically as `\\ln{...}` with the correct arguments enclosed. This handling should be added in a way that does not interfere with the rendering of other functions, thus preserving the existing functionality of the code for all other mathematical expressions."
