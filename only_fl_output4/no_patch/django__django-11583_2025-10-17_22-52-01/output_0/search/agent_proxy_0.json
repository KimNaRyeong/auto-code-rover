            "content": "To get a better understanding of the codebase and where the issue might be originating, we should focus on several key areas mentioned in the stack trace and issue description. Specifically, we'll want to look at the implementation of the Django `StatReloader`, the part of the code that interacts with `Pathlib`, and any references to `os.readlink` in conjunction with `Pathlib`. These areas are critical to understanding why a `ValueError: embedded null byte` might be thrown.\n\nHere are the API calls to consider for gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the StatReloader class**: This class is likely part of Django's autoreload mechanism based on the provided stack trace. It will give us insight into how file changes are being detected and handled.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"StatReloader\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the use of Pathlib within StatReloader**: Since the issue description suggests that the problem might be related to the use of `Pathlib` which wasn't present before a certain version, we need to check how `Pathlib` is being used within the `StatReloader` mechanism.\n   - Since the exact file isn't known, we'll start by searching across the codebase:\n     ```python\n     search_code(\"Pathlib\")\n     ```\n   \n3. **Identify where os.readlink is called**: Given the error occurs during a call to `os.readlink`, finding where this function is used could lead us directly to the problematic code snippet.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"os.readlink\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the implementation of snapshot_files in StatReloader**: Since the stacktrace points to `snapshot_files` as part of the process that eventually leads to the error, understanding its implementation will provide context on why it might fail intermittently.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"snapshot_files\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Search for references to the resolve method within the context of Pathlib**: The stacktrace culminates in an error during a `resolve` call, so examining how `resolve` is used in relation to `Pathlib` will be important.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Pathlib.resolve\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should gather sufficient context to understand why the `ValueError: embedded null byte` might be thrown during auto-reloading with `StatReloader` in the specified Django and Python version context."
