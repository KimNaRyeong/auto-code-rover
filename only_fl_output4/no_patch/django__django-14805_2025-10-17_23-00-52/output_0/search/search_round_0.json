It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.\nI'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like\n\"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\"\nwould be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context about where the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands are implemented in the Django framework. These commands are part of Django's database migration system, which is managed by the `django.core.management` package. Specifically, command definitions typically reside within a `commands` subdirectory and are implemented in Python classes that inherit from `BaseCommand` or one of its subclasses.\n\nGiven this knowledge, we should first search for the classes that implement these commands. We know the commands are named `makemigrations` and `migrate`, so we will search for classes with these names in the codebase. We're also interested in how these commands handle the `--noinput` option, which means we will need to examine the methods responsible for parsing and acting upon command-line arguments, typically `add_arguments` for adding arguments and `handle` for executing the command logic.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"makemigrations\")`: This will help us find the class definition for the `makemigrations` command.\n2. `search_class(\"migrate\")`: This will help us find the class definition for the `migrate` command.\n3. `search_method(\"add_arguments\")`: Since we're interested in how the `--noinput` option is implemented, finding where `add_arguments` is defined will give us clues about argument handling.\n4. `search_method(\"handle\")`: The `handle` method is where the command does its work, so we should find implementations of this to see how `--noinput` influences behavior.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand how the `--noinput` option is currently processed and where we might add output to inform the user when migrations cannot proceed without input."
