Understood, let's adjust the approach to ensure the necessary modules are mentioned as requirements for running the standalone script, as this issue seems to be part of a specific environment where certain libraries like `matplotlib` and `cartopy` are expected to be present. Please find below an updated standalone script which includes a preamble to check for and mention the necessary dependencies.

This updated script assumes that the reader knows to install the required dependencies beforehand, as automatically installing dependencies goes beyond the scope of a simple reproducer script. If the environment is correctly configured with `matplotlib`, `cartopy`, and other related packages, this script should function as intended.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def check_dependencies():
    required_modules = ['matplotlib', 'cartopy']
    import importlib.util
    not_found = []
    for module in required_modules:
        if importlib.util.find_spec(module) is None:
            not_found.append(module)
    if not_found:
        raise ModuleNotFoundError(f"Required module(s) not found: {', '.join(not_found)}. Please install them to proceed.")


def test_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid

        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=PlateCarree()))
        AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1,1), axes_class=axes_class)
        # If no exception is raised by this point,
        # assume the issue is fixed, and exit with code 0.
        print("Issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed: 'method' object is not subscriptable") from e


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_dependencies()
        test_issue()
    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
        print(e)
        print("Exiting due to missing dependencies.")
        exit(1)
```

This script includes a simple dependency check at the beginning and will instruct the user to install any missing modules before proceeding. If all required modules are present, it will then attempt to reproduce the given issue, printing a detailed stack trace if the problem persists or exiting gracefully if the issue appears to be resolved.
