        "intended_behavior": "The `_tick_only` method should check if `ax.axis` is subscriptable before attempting to access it with a key (e.g., 'bottom'). For axes types where `axis` does not support subscripting (like when `GeoAxes` is used), the method needs to gracefully handle this scenario. This might involve using an alternative approach to toggle visibility of tick labels and labels for axes that do not follow the dictionary-like interface. This ensures that `_tick_only` remains compatible with both default matplotlib axes and custom axes classes like `GeoAxes`. This revision aims to preserve the existing functionality of toggling axis label visibility while ensuring compatibility with a wider range of axis classes. The fix should ensure that any axes class that does not expose a subscriptable `axis` attribute can still be used without resulting in a `TypeError`."
