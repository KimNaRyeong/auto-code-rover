Based on your instructions, here is an updated standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as described. This script directly includes the function to print the stack trace, and it's structured to trigger the specific problem related to creating an `AxesGrid` with `cartopy`'s `GeoAxes`. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, otherwise, it will acknowledge the resolution of the mentioned issue if it doesn't encounter any problem during execution.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid

        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=PlateCarree()))
        try:
            AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1), axes_class=axes_class)
            # If no exception is raised to this point, the issue is considered fixed.
            print("The issue regarding 'TypeError: 'method' object is not subscriptable' seems to be resolved.")
            exit(0)
        except TypeError as e:
            if "'method' object is not subscriptable" in str(e):
                print_stacktrace(e)
                raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e
            else:
                print("An unexpected TypeError occurred, not matching the issue's signature.")
                print_stacktrace(e)
                exit(1)
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Missing module: {e.name}. Ensure all dependencies are installed.")
        exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

Before running this script, please ensure that you have installed the required dependencies (`matplotlib` and `cartopy`). If the `cartopy` or any other required module is missing, this script will exit with a message indicating the missing module. Upon encountering the specific `TypeError` related to the issue, it prints out a detailed stack trace as per the function provided and raises an `AssertionError`. If the issue has been resolved (i.e., no `TypeError` is raised when executing the problematic code), the script will exit with code 0 and print a confirmation message.
