This preserves the existing functionality for document generation while fixing the issue with attribute name representation."

If the problem lies within Autodoc's handling of docstring content post-Napoleon processing, ensuring that underscores at the end of attribute names are properly handled will resolve the issue. Autodoc's rendering process needs to recognize these cases and treat them accordingly, maintaining the integrity of identifier names including their trailing underscores in the final HTML documentation."
