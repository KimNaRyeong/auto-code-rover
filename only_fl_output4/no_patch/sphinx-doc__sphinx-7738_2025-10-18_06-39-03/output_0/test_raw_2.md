Given the complexity of directly reproducing the Sphinx documentation issue with a standalone Python script due to the intricacies involved with Sphinx setup, file generation, and HTML output validation, a direct reproduction is challenging to encapsulate in a single file script without external dependencies. 

However, I can guide you through a conceptual approach that simulates the steps needed to reproduce the issue and validate its presence in a simplified manner. The below script, while not able to execute all steps directly within Python (due to the need for external file creation and Sphinx command execution), outlines the procedure.

To create a functional `reproducer.py` as requested, we simulate steps closely while acknowledging limitations:
```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_files_for_sphinx():
    """Prepares Sphinx project structure and files"""
    # Create required directories
    os.makedirs("docs/source/_static", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("docs/source/_templates", exist_ok=True)
    # Sphinx config
    with open("docs/source/conf.py", "w") as conf:
        conf.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']\n")
    # Sphinx index.rst
    with open("docs/source/index.rst", "w") as index:
        index.write(".. autoclass:: mymodule.A\n")
    # Python module with docstring to document
    os.makedirs("mymodule", exist_ok=True)
    with open("mymodule/__init__.py", "w") as init_file:
        init_file.write("class A:\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    hello_: int\n        hi\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n")

def run_sphinx():
    """Executes Sphinx to generate documentation"""
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-quickstart", "--quiet", "--project", "My Project", "--author", "Author Name", "--no-batchfile", "--no-makefile", "--sep", "-p", "docs/source"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs/source", "docs/build"], check=True)

def check_documentation():
    """Checks the generated HTML for the issue"""
    try:
        with open("docs/build/mymodule.A.html", "r") as f:
            content = f.read()
            if 'hello\\_' in content:
                raise AssertionError("Backslash found in attribute name, issue is present.")
            else:
                print("Issue not present, test passed.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise AssertionError("Documentation file was not found. Make sure Sphinx generated the docs correctly.")

def main():
    try:
        create_files_for_sphinx()
        run_sphinx()
        check_documentation()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Note**: 
- This script attempts to wrap around the Sphinx documentation generation and verification process. **However, it includes code that aims to initialize a Sphinx project programmatically (`sphinx-quickstart`), which Sphinx doesn't natively support through its API directly in this manner.** Executing `sphinx-quickstart` and `sphinx-build` would normally be done outside of Python scripts, in the shell.
- Realistically, reproducing and verifying this issue effectively would involve running a script that orchestrates these commands via the shell, then inspects the HTML files produced. Directly from a script, this involves careful directory setup and clean-up, and extensive error handling not fully illustrated in the above script. The provided script aims more to outline the necessary steps rather than serve as a fully operational automated solution.
- The script lacks real capability to fully automate due to Sphinx's interaction model requiring command line execution and the evaluation of HTML content for validation, which is outside the straightforward automation capabilities without employing additional libraries for HTML parsing.
