Let's approach this by:\n\n1. Searching for code or comments that may relate to the mathematical domain we're working in, such as \"sum-free sets,\" \"partition,\" or even broader terms like \"number theory.\" Such an approach might lead us to utility functions or classes designed for mathematical computations that could be extended or used by the Schur Number feature.\n\n2. Considering the possibility that the feature was integrated into an existing class or module focusing on similar mathematical concepts or number partitions. \n\nHere are the refined search API calls we can make to gather more context:\n\n- `search_code(\"sum-free sets\")`: Identifying any implementations or discussions around sum-free sets might take us closer to how Schur Numbers or their partitions are realized within the project.\n\n- `search_code(\"partition\")`: This would help us find code that deals with partitioning numbers, which is central to the Schur Number concept. The implementation details here could be closely related or directly involved in the addition of the Schur Number feature.\n\n- `search_code(\"number theory\")`: Since Schur Numbers fall under number theory, any references to this domain might lead us to relevant classes, methods, or files where the Schur Number functionality could reside.\n\nThese calls are aimed at capturing a broader spectrum of possibly related code areas, given the initial direct searches have not yielded results."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
