Given the initial mistake and misunderstandings, let's correct the approach based on the given task. This time we will make sure the `reproducer.py` file is correctly crafted to test for the issue as specified, using the provided function to print the stack trace for better clarity on any exceptions encountered. The goal is to replicate the reported issue within an isolated script, ensuring we capture any failure accurately.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_angle_to_string_after_pickle():
    import astropy.coordinates as coord
    import astropy.units as u
    import pickle

    ang = coord.Angle(0.25 * u.hourangle)
    
    # Serialize and then deserialize the angle object
    pang = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(ang))
    
    try:
        # Attempt to convert both original and unpickled angle to string
        original_str = ang.to_string()
        unpickled_str = pang.to_string()

        # Check if unpickled angle string representation matches the original
        assert original_str == unpickled_str, "Unpickled angle to_string representation does not match the original"
        
        print("Success: Unpickled angle representation matches the original.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unpickled angle to_string operation failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_angle_to_string_after_pickle()
```

This script tests the serialization and deserialization (`pickle` and `unpickle` processes) of an `Angle` object from the Astropy library, ensuring that an object's `to_string()` method works correctly after the process. If the unpickling process changes the state of the `Angle` object in such a way that its `to_string` method fails or behaves unexpectedly, the script will catch the exception, print a detailed stack trace using the provided function, and raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the test passes, it confirms that the issue has been resolved, and it will simply print a success message.
