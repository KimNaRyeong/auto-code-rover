Based on your requirements, here's a correctly structured standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the issue you're encountering with the `astropy.coordinates.Angle` object's `to_string()` method after pickling and unpickling. This script will check for the bug by attempting to recreate the scenario as described, and it will utilize the given function to print the stack trace clearly when the issue is present. The objective is to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected (indicating failure to correctly reproduce the `to_string()` behavior post-unpickle), or to exit with code 0 when the issue cannot be observed (indicating the issue has been resolved or cannot be reproduced).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import astropy.coordinates as coord
    import astropy.units as u
    import pickle
    
    # Create an Angle object and pickling it
    ang = coord.Angle(0.25 * u.hourangle)
    pickled_ang = pickle.dumps(ang)

    # Unpickling the Angle object
    pang = pickle.loads(pickled_ang)

    try:
        # Ensure both original and unpickled Angles can be represented as strings
        original_str = ang.to_string()
        unpickled_str = pang.to_string()

        # This confirms that to_string works for both instances identically
        assert original_str == unpickled_str, "Unpickled Angle does not match original"
        print("Test passed: Unpickled Angle representation matches the original.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Test failed: Exception occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Place this file at the root directory of the project and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. This script will specifically test whether the `to_string` method works identically on both the original and unpickled `Angle` objects. If the unpickled object's method call fails or behaves incorrectly, the detailed stack trace will be printed, and the script will exit with an error, signifying that the issue is present. If no exception is raised and the assertions pass, indicating that the unpickled object behaves as expected, the script will exit normally (exit code 0), signifying that the issue is either fixed or not reproducible with the given test.
