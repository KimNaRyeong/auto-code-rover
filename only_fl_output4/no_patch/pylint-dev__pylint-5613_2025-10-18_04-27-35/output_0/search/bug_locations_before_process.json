        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the `Run` class to include a new method or enhance the `__init__` method to accept initialization parameters directly akin to `output_format`, `project_name`, and `files_list`. This enhancement will allow developers to call `pyreverse` from Python code without manipulating `sys.argv`, making the API more Pythonic and user-friendly. The method should internally translate these parameters into the command-line argument format currently expected by `Run`. Additionally, ensure this change does not interfere with existing command-line functionality, preserving backward compatibility for users who rely on the CLI interface."
