Since the desired API does not exist, the reproduction will focus on attempting to use the current method and assert a failure due to the nature of this workaround.\n\nPlease note, for the purpose of this reproduction, the script will artificially raise an `AssertionError` after attempting the current problematic approach to demonstrate the failure of having a clean API for `pyreverse`, as the desired solution won't be directly tested because it doesn't exist in `pylint` currently.\n\n```python\nimport pylint\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef current_pyreverse_approach(name, files):\n    sys.argv = 'pyreverse -o png -p'.split() + [name] + files\n    try:\n        pylint.run_pyreverse()\n    except SystemExit as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\ndef desired_pyreverse_approach(name, files):\n    # Mock of the desired solution's invocation.\n    # This will not work because this API does not exist, but it's here to simulate the desired call structure.\n    try:\n        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)\n    except AttributeError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"The desired pyreverse API is not implemented.\") from e\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Simulation parameters\n    name = \"MyProject\"\n    files = [\"example1.py\", \"example2.py\"]\n\n    # Attempt to use the current, cumbersome approach.\n    current_pyreverse_approach(name, files)\n\n    # Attempt to use the desired, cleaner approach that we expect to fail.\n    try:\n        desired_pyreverse_approach(name, files)\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print(\"Issue reproduced successfully: The desired API for pyreverse does not exist.\")\n        sys.exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script, when run, should initially only showcase the handling of the artificial `AssertionError` raised by the absence of the desired API for `pyreverse`. It's structured to be extendable so that if `pylint` incorporates the suggested interface, the script can then be modified to test the actual implementation directly."
