To create a `reproducer.py` script that adheres to your requirements, you'd want to test the current capability of invoking `pyreverse` through `pylint` programmatically in a way that reflects the current problem, and then simulate what the desired solution's call might look like (thinking ahead for when this issue is addressed). Since the desired API does not exist, the reproduction will focus on attempting to use the current method and assert a failure due to the nature of this workaround.

Please note, for the purpose of this reproduction, the script will artificially raise an `AssertionError` after attempting the current problematic approach to demonstrate the failure of having a clean API for `pyreverse`, as the desired solution won't be directly tested because it doesn't exist in `pylint` currently.

```python
import pylint
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def current_pyreverse_approach(name, files):
    sys.argv = 'pyreverse -o png -p'.split() + [name] + files
    try:
        pylint.run_pyreverse()
    except SystemExit as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def desired_pyreverse_approach(name, files):
    # Mock of the desired solution's invocation.
    # This will not work because this API does not exist, but it's here to simulate the desired call structure.
    try:
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The desired pyreverse API is not implemented.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simulation parameters
    name = "MyProject"
    files = ["example1.py", "example2.py"]

    # Attempt to use the current, cumbersome approach.
    current_pyreverse_approach(name, files)

    # Attempt to use the desired, cleaner approach that we expect to fail.
    try:
        desired_pyreverse_approach(name, files)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue reproduced successfully: The desired API for pyreverse does not exist.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script, when run, should initially only showcase the handling of the artificial `AssertionError` raised by the absence of the desired API for `pyreverse`. It's structured to be extendable so that if `pylint` incorporates the suggested interface, the script can then be modified to test the actual implementation directly.
