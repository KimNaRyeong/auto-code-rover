Below is the `reproducer.py` standalone script designed to reproduce the issue described. This script sends a POST request to the Django application with a file containing a null byte in its extension. When the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError`, thereby fulfilling the criteria. Additionally, it utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show the stack trace of the issue if an exception is raised.

```python
import io
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def perform_request():
    contents = io.BytesIO(b"." * (1024 * 1024 * 3))  # Adjusting for binary mode, as StringIO is not compatible with binary modifications
    files = {"docfile": (b"bogus.txt\x00", contents, "text/plain")}
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # Check if response indicates success, assuming a non-500 response is correct
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise AssertionError("Expected a 200 OK response, got: {}".format(response.status_code))
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating an error occurred

    print("No error detected, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    perform_request()
```

Before running this script:
1. **Ensure your Django server is running** on localhost and listening on port 8000.
2. **Adjust the Django view and url setup** if necessary to match the endpoint path from the script (`"/"`).
3. **Install the required packages** if you haven't already: `requests`.

Please note, this script modifies the original approach slightly for correctness and clarity, specifically using `BytesIO` for binary safe operations and sending a request with an actually null-byte modified file name, ensuring it adheres to the issue description provided.
