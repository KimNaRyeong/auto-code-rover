Given the feedback and necessity for adjustment due to the error encountered, the updated version of `reproducer.py` presented here will carefully address the previous mistake—the incorrect multiplication by a float—and ensure that the intended behavior is properly enacted. Here is the corrected standalone Python script:

```python
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_request():
    # Corrected the file_content multiplication to use an integer instead of a float
    file_content = b"." * (1024 * 1024 * 3)  # Ensuring the file is >2.5M in size
    # StringIO is not used because we're dealing directly with bytes content
    files = {"docfile": ("bogus.\x00txt", file_content, "text/plain")}  # Injecting null byte into filename

    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # Asserting non-500 response to indicate success or error otherwise
        assert response.status_code != 500, "Server should not return 500 error."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 due to assertion failure or other Exception

    # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the issue appears to be resolved if no exception was raised
    print("Issue appears to be resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_malformed_request()
```

**Instructions for Use:**

- Ensure your Django server is running, ideally set up based on the context provided in the initial issue description.
- Place this script (`reproducer.py`) in the root directory of your Django project or in a location that can access the running Django server at `http://localhost:8000/`.
- Execute the script using Python 3 with the command `python3 reproducer.py`.
- The script attempts to send a POST request with a malformed file name to your Django server. It expects that the server handles this request correctly (i.e., it should not return a 500 status code if the issue is fixed).
- If the server responds with a 500 error, indicating the issue is present, the script will print the stack trace and exit with code 1.
- If the issue is fixed (meaning no 500 error from the server), the script prints a success message and exits with code 0.
