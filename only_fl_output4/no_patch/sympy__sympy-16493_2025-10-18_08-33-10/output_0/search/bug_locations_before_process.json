        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior for resolving the issue in the `replace_with_arrays` method is to modify it so that the `indices` parameter becomes optional. This would involve allowing the method call without specifying indices, in which case a default behavior should be assumed. The exact default behavior isn't specified in the issue description, therefore a reasonable approach might be:\n\n- When `indices` is not provided, the method could either assume no specific ordering, meaning it could default to using the order of tensors as they appear in `replacement_dict`, or it might use a natural ordering based on the tensor keys if that proves more intuitive for users.\n- The functionality should otherwise remain unchanged, supporting the same operations and checks as it currently does when `indices` is explicitly provided, ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.\n- A check should be added to handle the scenario when `indices` is None. This involves setting a default value for indices at the start of the method or incorporating logical checks throughout the method to operate correctly even when `indices` is not provided.\n- It is crucial that this update does not alter the method's behavior when `indices` is provided, to ensure that existing calls to the method do not break due to this change.\n\nTo implement this, one might start by updating the method signature to set a default value for `indices`, for example, `indices=None`. This would be followed by adjusting the logic within the method to handle the case when `indices` is `None`, deciding on how to proceed without explicit index guidance."
