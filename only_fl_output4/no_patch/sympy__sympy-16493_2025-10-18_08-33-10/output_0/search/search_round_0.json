This would involve a series of steps:\n\n1. **Finding the `.replace_with_arrays` method**: Since the method could be part of a class or be standalone, we should first search for it across the entire codebase.\n\n2. **Reviewing the implementation**: After locating the method, we'll need to examine its implementation details as well as the context in which it's used, including parameters and their usage.\n\n3. **Investigating related classes or files**: If `.replace_with_arrays` is part of a class, understanding the class structure and other methods could offer insights on how best to make `indices` optional.\n\nGiven these steps, here are the appropriate API calls to start with:\n\n- `search_method(\"replace_with_arrays\")`: This will help identify where `.replace_with_arrays` is defined within the project.\n  \nBased on the results from this initial search, we might then need to inspect the method's definition in detail or explore related classes or code."
