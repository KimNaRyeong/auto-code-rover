And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, I'll need to make a few targeted searches based on the information provided in the problem description. Firstly, I'll locate the erroneous error hint within the Django codebase to understand its current implementation. Since the issue mentions a problem with the handling of `ForeignKey` in the context of an intermediary model of a many-to-many (m2m) field, I will focus on finding where this hint is generated.\n\n- An initial step would be to locate the Django method or class responsible for validating or setting up many-to-many fields with an intermediary model. Given the issue's details, it's likely that this would be part of the model fields or database schema creation logic.\n  \n- Next, I will search for the specific hint string to identify where the incorrect message is being created. This will be key to understanding where the fix needs to be applied.\n\nTherefore, my API calls will aim to find where the incorrect usage of arguments `'symmetrical'` and `'through'` is referenced within the codebase, as well as any details about the related `ForeignKey` handling for m2m relationships.\n\nHere are the API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. `search_code(\"If you want to create a recursive relationship, use ForeignKey\")`\n   \nThis call is designed to find the exact location of the issue described, identifying where the erroneous hint is being generated.\n\n2. `search_method(\"validate_through_fields\")`\n\nGiven the context of the problem related to `through_fields` in m2m relationships, there's likely a method handling the validation or setup of these fields. If such a method exists, it could be directly involved in the issue or provide further context on the implementation.\n\n3. `search_code(\"symmetrical=False\")`\n\nThis call aims to identify any related code that might still be operating under outdated assumptions about symmetrical relationships in intermediary models, especially since the issue notes that `symmetrical=False` is no longer a required argument since Django 3.0.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of where the incorrect hint is generated and offer insights into how Django's m2m relationships with intermediary models are handled and validated."
