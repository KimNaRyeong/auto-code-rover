Search for the `DateField` class to find out which file it is defined in:\n   - `search_class(\"DateField\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that `__repr__` works but `__str__` does not, it's necessary to check if there is an explicit `__str__` implementation for `DateField` or its parent classes, which might be handling list types incorrectly or not be present at all:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DateField\")`\n\n3. The issue specifically involves how `input_formats` is handled. It's represented as a list, but attempting to print it directly leads to an error. Thus, understanding how `input_formats` is defined or modified in `DateField` could provide insights:\n   - `search_code(\"input_formats\")`"
