LaTeX priniting: \mathrm vs. \text
It turns out that both `\mathrm` and `\text` is used for printing "text" in the LaTeX printing routines. It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.

### \text
 * **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font
 * **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package

### \mathrm
 * **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages
 * **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman

Some quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\text` in the .py-files.

Ideally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)

Probably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.
