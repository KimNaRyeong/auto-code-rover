Depending on the configuration setting decided upon (either sticking with `\\mathrm` or moving to `\\text`), the documentation comments should be updated to reflect this choice. This ensures consistency across the documentation and helps in aligning with the new approach once the helper function for printing text in LaTeX is implemented."

If `\\text` is chosen as the default but requires the `amsmath` package, ensure that this dependency is clearly documented. Alternatively, if a helper method is implemented to abstract the rendering of text in LaTeX expressions, refactor these instances to use the new method, ensuring that the function dynamically adapts based on the configuration while preserving the functionality of dynamically generated documentation."
