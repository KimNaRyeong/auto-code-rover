            "content": "Given the issue, we need to understand where and how `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are being used in the LaTeX printing routines within the codebase. To get started, we will need to locate instances of these usages as well as any configurable settings or helper functions that might currently exist for LaTeX printing. First, let's gather context around these LaTeX commands and any related printing or configuration functionalities within the code by conducting the following searches:\n\n1. For understanding the broader context in which `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are used, we need to find where these LaTeX commands are being invoked in the code:\n   - `search_code(\"\\\\mathrm\")`\n   - `search_code(\"\\\\text\")`\n\n2. Since the issue suggests adding a helper function (e.g., `print_text`) to handle LaTeX text printing, we should search if any such function already exists or if there are similar helpers that we could extend or mimic:\n   - `search_method(\"print_text\")`\n\n3. The concept of making this feature \"configurable\" suggests there may already be configuration handling in place that we can tie into. Let's search for methods or classes that are likely to be involved in printing configuration settings, though without specific names we will be somewhat speculative:\n   - `search_code(\"config\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_config\")`\n   - `search_method(\"set_config\")`\n\nThese searches will help us map out how `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are currently used within the project, locate existing infrastructure for LaTeX printing and configuration, and identify where we might integrate the ability to switch between these two LaTeX commands through a configuration setting or through the introduction of a new helper function."
