        "intended_behavior": "The `generate_renamed_fields` method should be enhanced to correctly handle the scenario where both a model and its fields are renamed simultaneously. This enhancement involves ensuring that before attempting to generate any rename operations for fields, the method verifies that any related model renames have been accounted for in its internal tracking. Specifically, the method should:\n\n- Check if a model rename operation has occurred for the current model being processed for field renames.\n- If so, adjust the internal mappings and references to use the new model name before processing field renames.\n- Ensure that any field being marked as renamed is accurately tracked against the correctly named model to prevent `KeyError` or any inconsistencies in the state mappings used by the autodetector.\n\nThis adjusted behavior will ensure that renaming models and their fields in the same migration does not cause crashes due to incorrect internal state references, preserving the integrity and functionality of the migration autodetection process."
