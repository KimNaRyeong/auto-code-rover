        "intended_behavior": "When `AnchoredLocatorBase.__call__` is invoked to calculate positioning for the inset axes, it should ensure that all objects (including `self.axes`, which `inset_axes` acts upon) are properly initialized and associated with an active figure, preventing the `NoneType` error when accessing `self.figure._get_renderer()`. The method should verify the presence of a figure or renderer before proceeding with operations that require them, gracefully handling scenarios where they might not be immediately available."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should include a check or a contingency plan for situations where `renderer` might be `None`. Before attempting to access `self.figure._get_renderer()`, it should confirm that `self.figure` is not `None`. If it is, the method should either delay the operation until the renderer is available or handle the scenario in a way that doesn't result in a breakdown of functionality. This might mean deferring rendering tasks or initializing objects with a placeholder or default renderer that can be updated later."
