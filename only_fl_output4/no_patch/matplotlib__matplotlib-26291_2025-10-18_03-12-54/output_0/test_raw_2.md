To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the provided issue and uses the specified function to print the stack trace clearly, follow the structure below. This script will intentionally attempt to replicate the mentioned error and use your `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed error information if the script encounters an exception.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

        fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])
        # Intentionally replicate provided code to provoke the reported error
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width=1.3, height=0.9)

        # Check if inset_axes created returns a valid object (not raising exceptions)
        assert axins is not None, "inset_axes did not return a valid object."

        # Show the plot for visual inspection (in case script runs without exceptions)
        plt.show()

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the specific error is related to the issue described, you can add an assertion here
        # For example, check if the exception is an AttributeError to handle it specifically.

        # Raise AssertionError to indicate script failure due to the encountered issue.
        raise AssertionError(f"Encountered an issue replicating the bug: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script explicitly tries to execute the problematic code and, upon encountering an exception, utilizes the defined `print_stacktrace` function to give a detailed error report. The goal is either to catch the issue as described or assert a failure if an unexpected problem occurs. When the underlying issue with `matplotlib` or the relevant toolkit is resolved, this script is designed to exit with code 0, implying success, following your instructions on expected behavior.
