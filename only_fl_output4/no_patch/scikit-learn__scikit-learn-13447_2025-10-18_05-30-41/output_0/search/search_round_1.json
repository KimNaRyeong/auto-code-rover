Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "The gathered code snippets from the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function in `sklearn/metrics/ranking.py` provide significant insight into how samples with zero true labels or all labels true are handled and how the `sample_weight` parameter is applied. Let's analyze each part regarding the three questions we need to consider.\n\n### Analysis of snippets around line 732\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n- This part of the code checks if all labels for a given sample are either true or false (`relevant.size == 0 or relevant.size == n_labels`). If so, it considers the label ranking precision for this sample as perfect (score = 1.0) and then continues to the next sample without further calculations (`out += 1. continue`).\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n- This code snippet directly relates to the issue described, where the special treatment of samples with all labels true or false does not take into account the `sample_weight` parameter. The logic correctly skips further calculations for these cases, as their precision score is treated as 1.0, but it fails to multiply this score by the sample's weight. The continuation (`continue`) to the next iteration of the loop prevents any adjustment or consideration of the `sample_weight`.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n- The intended behavior should involve applying the `sample_weight` to these special case samples. If a sample weight is specified and non-default for the sample with all labels true or all labels false, this weight should multiplicatively adjust the contribution of the sample's score (1.0) to the overall average precision score.\n\n### Analysis of snippets around line 740\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n- This snippet handles the calculation of a modified average precision for each sample that does not fall into the all-true or all-false label categories. Specifically, it calculates a sample's precision (`aux`), and if `sample_weight` is provided, it scales this precision by the sample's weight before adding it to the cumulative score (`out += aux`).\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n- The snippet shows the correct application of `sample_weight` for samples that do not meet the all-true or all-false criteria. It illustrates the mechanism by which `sample_weight` should ideally also be applied to the special cases mentioned earlier -- which is exactly where the problem lies, as highlighted by the issue.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n- While this part behaves as expected for its specific cases, reflecting on its implementation helps underline the need for consistent application of `sample_weight` across all samples, regardless of their label configurations. The intended behavior for the entire function should consistently apply `sample_weight` to all samples, including those with uniform labels.\n\n### Solution Approach\n- A potential fix would involve adjusting the logic around line 732 to apply the `sample_weight` when increasing `out` by `1.0` for samples with all labels true or false. This requires multiplying the score (1.0 for these samples) by the sample's weight before adding it to the total score `out`. Given the insight from the analysis, this fix seems necessary to address the bug described in the issue."

Specifically, before aggregating this perfect score (1.0) to the total (`out += 1.`), it should be multiplied by the sample's weight if `sample_weight` is not `None`. This adjustment will ensure that the special case samples contribute to the final metric in accordance with their specified weights, preserving the overall intent and functionality of weighted evaluation in the metric calculation.\n    - The corrected snippet should resemble:\n      ```python\n      if (relevant.size == 0 or relevant.size == n_labels):\n          # If all labels are relevant or unrelevant, the score is also\n          # equal to 1. The label ranking has no meaning.\n          if sample_weight is not None:\n              out += sample_weight[i]\n          else:\n              out += 1.\n          continue\n      ```\n    - This change ensures that `sample_weight` is applied universally across all samples, accurately reflecting their intended contribution to the label ranking average precision score, thus resolving the inconsistency reported in the issue."
