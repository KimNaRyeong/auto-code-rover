        "intended_behavior": "Within the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function, when handling samples with all labels true or all labels false (around line 732), the code should apply `sample_weight` to the score of these samples before adding it to the cumulative score. Specifically, before aggregating this perfect score (1.0) to the total (`out += 1.`), it should be multiplied by the sample's weight if `sample_weight` is not `None`. This adjustment will ensure that the special case samples contribute to the final metric in accordance with their specified weights, preserving the overall intent and functionality of weighted evaluation in the metric calculation.\n\nThe corrected snippet should resemble:\n  ```python\n  if (relevant.size == 0 or relevant.size == n_labels):\n      # If all labels are relevant or unrelevant, the score is also\n      # equal to 1. The label ranking has no meaning.\n      if sample_weight is not None:\n          out += sample_weight[i]\n      else:\n          out += 1.\n      continue\n  ```\n\nThis change ensures that `sample_weight` is applied universally across all samples, accurately reflecting their intended contribution to the label ranking average precision score, thus resolving the inconsistency reported in the issue."
