Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\r\n\r\n<!-- Example: Joblib Error thrown when calling fit on LatentDirichletAllocation with evaluate_every > 0-->\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport sklearn.metrics\r\n\r\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\r\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\r\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\r\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\r\n    truth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\r\n   machine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\r\n\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\n\r\nPython deps:\r\n       pip: 19.0.3\r\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n     numpy: 1.14.6\r\n     scipy: 1.1.0\r\n    Cython: 0.29.6\r\n    pandas: 0.22.0\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n\n"
