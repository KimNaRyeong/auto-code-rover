        "intended_behavior": "The method should be updated to construct a query using 'WHERE NOT EXISTS' instead of 'NOT IN'. This change aims to improve query performance and the handling of 'NULL' values more intuitively. The logic inside 'split_exclude' should be adapted to generate 'NOT EXISTS' subqueries that are capable of efficiently handling exclusions across N-to-many relationships. The adaptation should ensure that the exclusions still accurately exclude the intended records, maintaining current functionality with the added benefits of performance optimization and correct 'NULL' handling inherent to 'NOT EXISTS'. Essentially, the new implementation should transform the existing subquery logic to adopt a pattern similar to: WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM thetable WHERE thetable.parent_id = outer_table.id AND condition_here). This alteration should strive to keep the externally observable behavior of Django's ORM the same, ensuring that existing applications using Django will not have to alter their codebases due to this change, beyond the potential performance improvements they might observe."
