It constructs a nested query that effectively excludes records matching specified criteria. This is particularly used when needing to exclude rows based on conditions that span relationships, which are inherently more complex queries.\n- The current implementation uses a `NOT IN` subquery pattern to exclude the desired rows. Specifically, it constructs queries that look something like: `WHERE NOT (pk IN (SELECT parent_id FROM thetable WHERE name = 'foo' AND parent_id IS NOT NULL))`.\n- The method acknowledges the limitations and potential optimizations that could be achieved by using `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead, as indicated in the comments.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\n- The issue describes a concern with the current implementation using `NOT IN` for excluding rows in multi-valued relationships, mainly because `NOT IN` can have adverse performance implications on some query planners and has quirky behavior regarding `NULL` values.\n- The `split_exclude` method is directly related to the issue because it embodies the implementation pattern being questioned. The performance and correctness problems highlighted in the issue arise from this specific chunk of code.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- Based on the issue description, the intended behavior should shift towards constructing exclusions using `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN`. This change aims to improve the performance by making it easier for database query planners to optimize these types of queries. Additionally, `NOT EXISTS` provides more intuitive and reliable handling of `NULL` values.\n- Implementing this change would involve altering the logic within `split_exclude` to generate a `NOT EXISTS` subquery pattern, incorporating considerations for `NULL` values directly into this pattern without needing to explicitly manage them as done in the current `NOT IN` approach.\n\nTo proceed towards a resolution, the next steps would involve drafting a replacement logic for the `split_exclude` method that utilizes `NOT EXISTS`. This requires understanding how `NOT EXISTS` works in SQL, the Django ORM's way of constructing such queries, and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the Django query construction logic."

This change aims to improve query performance and the handling of `NULL` values more intuitively. The logic inside `split_exclude` should be adapted to generate `NOT EXISTS` subqueries that are capable of efficiently handling exclusions across N-to-many relationships. The adaptation should ensure that the exclusions still accurately exclude the intended records, maintaining current functionality with the added benefits of performance optimization and correct `NULL` handling inherent to `NOT EXISTS`. Essentially, the new implementation should transform the existing subquery logic to adopt a pattern similar to: \n    ```sql\n    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM thetable WHERE thetable.parent_id = outer_table.id AND condition_here)\n    ```\n    This alteration should strive to keep the externally observable behavior of Django's ORM the same, ensuring that existing applications using Django will not have to alter their codebases due to this change, beyond the potential performance improvements they might observe."
