        "intended_behavior": "The method `_resolve_output_field` needs to be enhanced to more gracefully manage type resolutions for combined expressions, especially where `output_field` might implicitly vary between integral types (like `IntegerField` and `AutoField`). This enhancement should include logic to automatically determine a compatible `output_field` type when it's safe to do so (e.g., preferring a broader or more generic type that can accommodate all involved types) or at least providing clearer, more actionable guidance for developers on specifying `output_field` explicitly in complex cases to prevent ambiguities. The goal is to preserve the method's role in ensuring type safety while improving its flexibility and the clarity of its error messaging for developers, hence addressing the regression observed between Django versions 3.0.8 and 3.2 without impairing existing functionalities or expectations around expression type checking."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Although `ExpressionWrapper` does not directly manage `output_field` resolution (as indicated by the absence of `output_field` and `_resolve_output_field` in this class), it could benefit from a review or possible minor adjustment to ensure it properly interfaces with the type resolution logic, particularly in the inheritance and execution of its superclass methods. This might involve adding checks or logic that help preempt the type conflict errors by ensuring that expressions flowing through `ExpressionWrapper` instances are either correctly tagged with an explicit `output_field` where necessary or by facilitating better automatic type inference. This adjustment should support the nuanced type handling required by complex queries, thereby directly addressing the issue at hand without altering the core functionalities provided by `ExpressionWrapper` for SQL expression wrapping and query generation."
