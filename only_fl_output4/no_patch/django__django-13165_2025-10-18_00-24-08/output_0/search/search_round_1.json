        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `ExpressionWrapper` and its `output_field` property within the Django project (specifically for version 3.2, as mentioned in the issue), we'll need to examine several areas of the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. Here are the API calls that would be apt to provide insights into the problem and possibly identify any related changes from Django 3.0.8 to 3.2 which might have introduced this regression:\n\n1. We should start by looking into the `ExpressionWrapper` class itself to understand its implementation and any changes in its behavior regarding `output_field`. This requires examining the class definition and methods that manage the `output_field` property.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given that the issue mentions a problem with combining expressions without an explicit `output_field`, inspecting how `ExpressionWrapper` computes or infers `output_field` would be crucial. Specifically, we're interested in any method that deals with resolving `output_field`.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"_resolve_output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")\n   ```\n\n3. The error stack trace also suggests that there's an issue during query compilation, especially in parts of the code that prepare expressions for SQL conversion. This implies we should look into how expressions are formatted for SQL and how grouped expressions (like averages or sums combined with other fields) are handled.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"select_format\")\n   search_method(\"get_group_by\")\n   ```\n\n4. Given that the report includes a `FieldError` related to mixed types (`IntegerField`, `AutoField`), it's clear that Django's type inference for expressions might fail under certain conditions in Django 3.2. It might be beneficial to look into where and how Django checks expression field types for consistency.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"Expression contains mixed types\")\n   ```\n\n5. Finally, since the issue was not present in Django 3.0.8, understanding any related changes or fixes introduced in Django 3.2 would be helpful. This might involve looking into release notes or change logs separately, as the API calls provided might not directly cover project history.\n\nThese API calls will furnish us with a baseline of code context regarding how `ExpressionWrapper` and related mechanisms work within Django, and how they might lead to the observed issue when lacking an explicit `output_field` in combined expressions."

It defines methods for handling expressions, potentially combining fields or applying functions to them within a Django ORM query. The methods listed like `__init__`, `set_source_expressions`, and `as_sql` suggest it plays a crucial role in constructing SQL queries from Django ORM expressions.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  Given that the issue mentions `ExpressionWrapper` losing its `output_field` for combined expressions without an explicit `output_field`, the class definition is central to understanding why the error might occur. The absence of methods specifically managing or resolving `output_field` directly in this class might hint at such functionality being inherited or indirectly managed, which could be an area causing the regression.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  The intended behavior would be for `ExpressionWrapper` instances that combine expressions to correctly infer or maintain an `output_field` attribute, ensuring SQL queries derived from these expressions are properly formed and executed without errors related to field types.\n\n#### 2. Absence of `output_field` and `_resolve_output_field` Method in `ExpressionWrapper`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The absence of these methods in the `ExpressionWrapper` class indicates that the logic to handle or resolve `output_field` is not directly implemented in this class. It might be managed by its superclass or in other parts of the ORM.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  The bug's root might lie in how `output_field` resolution is inherited or managed outside of the `ExpressionWrapper` itself, particularly if there were changes or assumptions altered in Django 3.2 affecting this indirection.\n\n#### 3. `select_format` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  Methods named `select_format` found across the `expressions.py`, `json.py`, and other files suggest that they format expressions for inclusion in a SQL `SELECT` clause. These methods likely contribute to converting ORM expressions into SQL snippets, handling different data types and expressions.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  Since the process involves expressions and their types, any discrepancy in handling or formatting combined expressions (especially those without explicit `output_field`) could lead to errors. The interaction between `select_format` and expressions might not accommodate mixed or inferred types correctly in Django 3.2.\n\n#### 4. `get_group_by` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` builds the `GROUP BY` clauses for SQL queries based on the query's selected fields, annotations, and aggregate functions. It's designed to ensure the correctness of grouped queries.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  Since `GROUP BY` behavior is affected by the fields involved in the query, including those manipulated by `ExpressionWrapper`, any misunderstandings or mishandlings regarding `output_field` in expressions might directly impact how `get_group_by` constructs its clauses, potentially leading to the observed error.\n\n#### 5. `_resolve_output_field` Method in `BaseExpression`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  Found in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, this method seems crucial for determining the `output_field` of an expression, especially in scenarios involving multiple field types. It checks for type consistency across combined expressions, raising an error if a unified type cannot be determined.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  This functionality is directly related to the issue, as the error message encountered (`Expression contains mixed types: IntegerField, AutoField. You must set output_field.`) is emitted by this method. It indicates that type resolution fails for combined expressions lacking explicit `output_field` declarations.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  Ideally, this method would allow for combined expressions either to correctly infer a single, coherent `output_field` type or to provide informative feedback that encourages the developer to specify an `output_field` when type inference is ambiguous.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The issue seems rooted in how `ExpressionWrapper` and its interplay with the ORM and SQL compilation processes handle `output_field` resolution for combined expressions.\n- The direct source of the error message is within the `_resolve_output_field` method in `BaseExpression`, indicating a failure to unify the types of combined expressions.\n\nTo further approach resolving the issue, investigating changes between Django 3.0.8 and 3.2 that affect expression type resolution, especially in how `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with `output_field` determination, would be warranted. This includes looking into potential changes in `select_format`, `_resolve_output_field`, or even higher-level query composition logic that might assume different `output_field` behaviors."

This enhancement should include logic to automatically determine a compatible `output_field` type when it's safe to do so (e.g., preferring a broader or more generic type that can accommodate all involved types) or at least providing clearer, more actionable guidance for developers on specifying `output_field` explicitly in complex cases to prevent ambiguities. The goal is to preserve the method's role in ensuring type safety while improving its flexibility and the clarity of its error messaging for developers, hence addressing the regression observed between Django versions 3.0.8 and 3.2 without impairing existing functionalities or expectations around expression type checking.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Class:** `ExpressionWrapper`\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** \n  Although `ExpressionWrapper` does not directly manage `output_field` resolution (as indicated by the absence of `output_field` and `_resolve_output_field` in this class), it could benefit from a review or possible minor adjustment to ensure it properly interfaces with the type resolution logic, particularly in the inheritance and execution of its superclass methods. This might involve adding checks or logic that help preempt the type conflict errors by ensuring that expressions flowing through `ExpressionWrapper` instances are either correctly tagged with an explicit `output_field` where necessary or by facilitating better automatic type inference. This adjustment should support the nuanced type handling required by complex queries, thereby directly addressing the issue at hand without altering the core functionalities provided by `ExpressionWrapper` for SQL expression wrapping and query generation.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors outline a path for resolving the identified issue while ensuring backward compatibility and preserving the robustness of Django's ORM expressions handling."
