        "content": "To get sufficient context to address the issue, I would need to inspect the parts of the `pytest` codebase that are responsible for handling the `--fixtures` option. This likely involves the command-line option parsing section, as well as how fixtures information is displayed to the user. To start, here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Search for the method that handles the `--fixtures` option. Since `pytest` uses a plugin system, the command-line option might be handled in a method that registers or acts upon this option.\n   - `search_method(\"pytest_addoption\")`\n   \n2. Once we have the method that adds the option, we would likely need to look at how fixtures are collected and displayed. Assuming there is a straightforward method for collecting fixture information:\n   - `search_method(\"show_fixtures_per_test\")`\n   - `search_method(\"report_header\")`\n\n3. Lastly, to directly address the issue, I'd look for code snippets responsible for outputting fixture information, which may involve filtering or formatting fixture details for display.\n   - `search_code(\"def pytest_report_header\")`\n   - `search_code(\"def showfixtures\")`"
