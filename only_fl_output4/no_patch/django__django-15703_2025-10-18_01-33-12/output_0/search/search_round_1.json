        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights into how `index_together` and `indexes` are used in the codebase, as well as where the `Index` class is defined. We'll go through the results to understand the implications for deprecating `index_together` in favor of `indexes`.\n\n### Analysis of `index_together`\n\n- **Occurrence and Usage:** The search results show that `index_together` is used across multiple core Django files, including migration-related files (`django/db/migrations/`), schema backends (`django/db/backends/`), and model base (`django/db/models/base.py` and `options.py`). This suggests that `index_together` is deeply integrated into Django's ORM layer, especially in handling database schema creation and migration.\n- **Code Implication:** These files likely include logic for interpreting `index_together` directives in model Meta classes to generate appropriate SQL for creating composite indexes during migrations and schema operations.\n- **Intended Behavior in Context of Issue:** Since the issue aims to deprecate `index_together`, the intended behavior would involve modifying or replacing the logic in these areas to use `indexes` declarations with the `Index` class for composite index creation.\n\n### Analysis of `indexes`\n\n- **Usage in the Codebase:** The usage of `indexes =` appears in various backend-specific modules (`django/db/backends/`) and migrations (`django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`), indicating that explicit index declarations using `indexes` are already in place for some database operations.\n- **Code Implication:** This suggests that parts of Django's infrastructure are capable of handling `Index` instances defined in model `Meta` classes to generate SQL for index creation. The existing usage might provide patterns or frameworks for transitioning `index_together` logic towards.\n- **Intended Behavior:** With the issue's focus, these parts of the code would serve as templates or guides for expanding the usage of `indexes` to fully replace `index_together`.\n\n### `Index` Class Analysis\n\n- **Definition and Responsibilities:** The `Index` class is defined in `django/db/models/indexes.py` and contains methods crucial for SQL generation for index creation and removal, along with supporting conditional and expression-based indexes.\n- **Relation to the Issue:** This class is central to the proposed switch from `index_together` to `indexes`. Enhancing or ensuring this class's capabilities to support scenarios covered by `index_together` is likely necessary.\n- **Intended Usage:** For the deprecation, making sure that `Index` can handle composite indexes (previously declared with `index_together`) transparently and efficiently will be key.\n\n### Failed Searches for `get_indexes` and `add_index`\n\n- **Implication:** The absence of these methods suggests that there's no straightforward, existing API in the `Model` class for retrieving or adding indexes dynamically based on model definitions. This could mean either that the index handling is more static (defined at the class level and interpreted by the schema and migration frameworks) or that these operations are named differently or scattered across different parts of the framework.\n- **Next Steps:** Considering the issue's scope, further investigation might be needed into how Django internally adds or retrieves index information from model definitions. This could involve deeper diving into the migration and schema creation process to understand where `index_together` and `indexes` get translated into SQL statements.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the information collected and the analysis above, the next steps towards solving the issue would include:\n\n1. **Refactoring Migration and Schema Logic:** Updating the logic in migration and schema-related files to interpret `indexes` with composite indexes (mimicking `index_together`) instead of or in addition to the current handling of `index_together`.\n2. **Enhancing the `Index` Class:** Ensuring the `Index` class supports all functionalities covered by `index_together`, including seamless handling of composite indexes and any edge cases not currently covered by `indexes`.\n\nIn addressing the issue, the transition must be carefully planned to ensure compatibility and to provide a clear migration path for existing Django projects relying on `index_together`. This would likely involve detailed documentation and potentially generating warnings for a deprecation period before `index_together` is fully removed."

The new behavior should ensure that migrations are properly generated to reflect transitions from `index_together` to `indexes`.\n\n#### Location 3: File: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that operations related to model indexes explicitly handle `indexes`, including creating operations that convert `index_together` definitions into `Index` instances under the `indexes` attribute in model Meta.\n\n#### Location 4: File: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** Update schema creation and alteration methods to prioritize `indexes` attribute handling, including synthesizing appropriate SQL for `Index` instances that replace `index_together` usage. The existing functionality for composite indexes should be preserved by translating `index_together` declarations to `Index` objects if necessary.\n\n#### Location 5: File: `django/db/models/options.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** This file likely contains logic for parsing and storing model Meta options, including `index_together`. The `index_together` should be deprecated here in favor of constructing `Index` instances from it and adding those to the `indexes` list. This maintains backward compatibility while pushing the codebase towards the newer framework.\n\n#### Location 6: File: `django/db/models/indexes.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** Although not directly indicated as buggy, enhancements or confirmations might be needed here to ensure the `Index` class supports all use cases covered by `index_together`, specifically handling composite indexes effectively.\n\nEach of these locations requires modifications or enhancements that ensure a smooth transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, with special attention to backward compatibility and clear migration paths for existing Django applications. These changes would encompass updating both internal Django mechanisms for handling model indexes and providing guidance for developers to migrate their code."
