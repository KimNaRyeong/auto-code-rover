To accurately reflect the issue as described, where `PdfPages` defaults to `keep_empty=True` (creating an empty PDF file) but the desired default behavior should be `keep_empty=False` (not creating an empty PDF file), the included code asserts the problem scenario and captures any exceptions related to this behavior. Given the setup, this code will exit with code 0 when the desired behavior is implemented, where no empty PDF files are created by default. If the behavior has not changed (`keep_empty=True` as default), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace of the issue.

```python
import matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pdfpages_behavior():
    filename = "/tmp/test_empty_pdf.pdf"
    try:
        # Create an instance of PdfPages with the (currently) default keep_empty=True behavior
        pdf = matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages(filename)
        pdf.close()

        # Check if the file exists, which it should not if keep_empty defaults to False.
        file_exists = os.path.isfile(filename)
        assert not file_exists, "PdfPages created an empty PDF file, even though keep_empty should default to False."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        try:
            if os.path.exists(filename):
                os.remove(filename)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Failed to clean up the test PDF file.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

    print("Test passed: PdfPages did not create an empty PDF file by default, as expected.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pdfpages_behavior()
```

This script will:
- Attempt to create an empty PDF file using `matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages` without adding any figures.
- Check if the file has been created, which would indicate `keep_empty` defaulted to `True`.
- Assert the desired behavior (`keep_empty=False` by default) by raising an `AssertionError` if an empty file is created.
- If the behavior has changed (no empty file created), it will confirm the fix and exit with code 0.
- It includes exception handling to print a detailed stack trace if the assertion fails or if any other error occurs during the execution.
