This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address the three guiding questions for the parts of the code that were found:\n\n### Results from `search_class(\"PdfPages\")`:\n\nBoth classes named `PdfPages` found in `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` have a `keep_empty` attribute that is initialized in their constructors with a default value of `True`. This attribute controls whether a PDF file with zero figures is allowed to be written to the disk.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   The `PdfPages` class(es) are responsible for managing the creation of PDF files, wherein the `keep_empty` parameter decides if an empty PDF (with zero pages/figures) should be created or not.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue is directly related to these parts of the code, as it describes the problem with the current default behavior (`keep_empty=True`) and proposes changing it to `False` and eventually deprecating `keep_empty`. The goal is to align with the PDF standard, which does not consider a file with zero pages as a valid PDF document.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would be modifying the `__init__` method of both `PdfPages` implementations to set `keep_empty=False` by default. Additionally, a deprecation strategy for the `keep_empty` parameter needs to be devised, which involves warning users if an empty PDF would have been created due to the now changed default behavior.\n\n### Results from `search_code(\"keep_empty=True\")`:\n\nThe instances of `keep_empty=True` are found in the `__init__` methods of both `PdfPages` classes, confirming their current default behavior.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   It sets the default value of `keep_empty` to `True` during the initialization of `PdfPages` objects.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   This code snippet is the focal point of the issue, as it needs to be changed to set the default value of `keep_empty` to `False`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended change is the modification of these lines to default `keep_empty` to `False`. This alteration directly addresses the request in the issue.\n\n### Failed search for `search_method_in_class(\"init\", \"PdfPages\")`:\n\nThe failed search was likely due to a typo or inconsistency in invoking the search API. Given that we did find the necessary details in the `__init__` methods through other searches, this failure does not impact our overall understanding of the issue.\n\n### Results from `search_code(\"deprecation warning\")`:\n\nDeprecation warnings are found in various parts of the codebase, indicating a standardized approach for warning users about deprecated features.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   It shows how deprecation warnings are implemented within the library, providing examples of how to warn users about deprecated functionality or parameters while providing alternatives or indicating removed features.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   While not directly related to the `keep_empty` parameter's functionality, these snippets offer guidance on how to implement the deprecation warning for `keep_empty` when changing its default value and preparing for its removal.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Implementing a deprecation warning for the use of `keep_empty=True` follows the patterns found in these results. An effective warning would inform users of the change in default behavior and the eventual removal of the `keep_empty` parameter, guiding them towards adapting their code accordingly.\n\nThe next steps involve planning the changes to both `PdfPages` definitions to modify their `__init__` methods and introducing a deprecation warning strategy that informs the users about these changes in a clear and helpful manner, using the examples found as a template."

This change ensures that by default, a `PdfPages` object will not generate an empty PDF file, adhering to the PDF standard that a valid document must have one or more pages. This behavior preserves existing functionality for creating PDFs with content while preventing the creation of invalid empty PDFs.\n  - Implement a deprecation warning informing users that `keep_empty=True` will be deprecated. Guide users towards the new default behavior (`False`) and recommend explicitly setting `keep_empty=True` if they wish to maintain the old behavior temporarily.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`, Class: `PdfPages`, Method: `__init__`\n  \n  **Intended Behavior:** \n  - Similarly, change the default value of `keep_empty` from `True` to `False`. This change is in line with the PDF standards and ensures consistency across different backends of Matplotlib that handle PDF generation.\n  - Implement a deprecation warning for the `keep_empty` parameter to inform users of its impending deprecation and encourage them to adapt their code to comply with the new standards ensuring no invalid empty PDFs are intentionally generated.\n\n**Note:** For both locations, the introduction of a deprecation warning requires a careful approach to not disrupt existing workflows immediately. The warning should notify users of the change in behavior and the future removal of the `keep_empty` parameter, suggesting the recommended action for those who might be affected by this change. This approach facilitates a smoother transition to the new default behavior while aligning with best practices for managing breaking changes in software development."
