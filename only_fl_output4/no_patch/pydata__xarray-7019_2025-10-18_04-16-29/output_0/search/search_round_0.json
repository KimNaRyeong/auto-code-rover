        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray, we need to explore several key areas:\n1. How `dask.array` objects are currently integrated and used within xarray.\n2. Identify the points in the codebase where parallel computation options are currently managed, particularly focusing on arrays.\n3. Understand the mechanisms through which xarray wraps array-like objects, especially in light of the upcoming support for the array API standard mentioned in PR #6804.\n4. Locate the existing implementations of `.chunk` and `.compute` methods, as these are crucial to how computation graphs are constructed and executed in parallel frameworks.\n\nGiven these requirements, we will invoke the following API calls:\n- `search_code(\"dask.array\")`: To find how `dask.array` objects are referred to and used across the xarray project.\n- `search_method(\"chunk\")`: To locate the implementation and usage of the `.chunk` method.\n- `search_method(\"compute\")`: To find the implementation and usage of the `.compute` method.\n- `search_code(\"wrap array-like object\")`: Although this is a more exploratory query, it aims to find code snippets or comments related to how xarray plans to or currently wraps array-like objects, which might provide insight into how new frameworks like cubed could be integrated.\n- `search_code(\"array API standard\")`: To find references related to the new array API standard support, which could lead to related architectural decisions or implementations in the project."
