        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Context from `dask.array` References\nThe references to `dask.array` throughout the xarray codebase indicate a deeply integrated support for Dask arrays. They are utilized in a wide range of files, including core computational routines (`xarray/core/computation.py`, `xarray/core/dask_array_ops.py`), dataset handling (`xarray/core/dataset.py`, `xarray/core/dataarray.py`), and backends for data storage (`xarray/backends/api.py`, `xarray/backends/zarr.py`). These snippets likely encompass the implementation of parallel computations, data chunking and re-chunking, and lazy evaluation strategies, among other features facilitated by Dask.\n\n#### Analysis for the Issue\nGiven the issue's goal to extend flexibility in parallel execution frameworks beyond just Dask, these references highlight the critical zones where xarray couples with Dask. To introduce alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed, it's imperative to abstract these integration points, perhaps through a common interface or an adaptable backend system that can interchangeably use Dask or another array-like library.\n\n### Context from `chunk` and `compute` Methods\nThe `chunk` and `compute` methods are fundamental to the issue. These methods are essential for managing computation graphs and are available in both Dask and cubed, indicating a potential pathway for integration. The presence of these methods in core xarray objects (`Variable`, `DataArray`, and `Dataset`) showcases their importance in data manipulation and execution of parallel computations.\n\n#### Analysis for the Issue\nAdapting these methods to work transparently with multiple backends (Dask, cubed, or any array conforming to the array API standard) would likely involve introducing a level of abstraction that can dynamically determine the appropriate actions based on the backend specified by the user or the nature of the wrapped array-like object.\n\n### Unsuccessful Searches\nThe unsuccessful searches for \"wrap array-like object\" and \"array API standard\" suggest either that the terminology used in the search does not exactly match the codebase's terminology, or that explicit references to these concepts are not present or are too implicit in the current implementation.\n\n#### Further Exploration Needed\nTo bridge this gap, it might be beneficial to explore:\n- **Code around integration points with `dask.array`**: Specific API calls like `get_code_around_line` for selected files could provide insights into how wrapping and unwrapping of array-like objects is performed.\n- **Existing methods for handling wrapped arrays**: Searches like `search_method_in_file(\"wrap\", \"xarray/core/variable.py\")` or even broader queries around `array` or `backend` could reveal internal mechanics or discussions around array wrapping that were not uncovered in the initial search.\n- **PR #6804 and related discussions**: Since explicit search did not yield results, examining the PR directly (if accessible) or searching for terms closely related to its contributions might offer additional context. This could involve searching for more generic terms like `search_code(\"wrap*\")` or looking for newer mechanisms for array compatibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo facilitate the feature request described in the issue, it's evident that understanding and potentially abstracting the interactions with Dask arrays are crucial steps. Following this, considering the extension of similar abstraction layers to accommodate other array libraries in a plug-and-play manner will be essential. Further probing into the mechanics of array wrapping and the newly introduced array API standards through a more nuanced examination or direct code inspection seems necessary to fully address the integration of alternative parallel execution frameworks."

Intended behavior would involve abstracting the `.chunk` and `.compute` method implementations to delegate to the corresponding backend's implementation dynamically.\n\nIn all locations, preserving existing functionality means ensuring that default behaviors (assuming Dask as the backend) remain unaffected unless explicitly overridden by specifying a different computation manager/backend.

        "content": "The additional context gathered brings new insights into the workings of `xarray/core/dataset.py` and provides a clearer path for addressing the feature request. Let's analyze the findings:\n\n### Analysis of `wrap` in `xarray/core/dataset.py`\nThe snippets containing `wrap` in `xarray/core/dataset.py` are found in several methods (`as_numpy`, `stack`, `map`, `pad`, `curvefit`) and outside any functions, indicating various contexts where xarray deals with wrapping or manipulating data. Here's a breakdown:\n- **`as_numpy`**: This function likely converts xarray datasets or data arrays into NumPy arrays, which could involve unwrapping from one backend array type (e.g., `dask.array`) to a numpy array.\n- **`stack`, `map`, `pad`, `curvefit`**: These methods indicate data manipulation or analysis operations, which, when dealing with backend arrays (e.g., Dask arrays), may require wrapping or rewrapping of the computation results or inputs.\n\n#### Implications for the Issue\nUnderstanding how `wrap` is used across these contexts is crucial for implementing a flexible backend system. The presence of wrapping and unwrapping operations hints at the interaction points where xarray handles the transition between different array representations. This system must be made backend-agnostic or extendable to accommodate not just Dask but also other array libraries like cubed.\n\nTo support alternative parallel frameworks as described in the issue:\n- **Intended Behavior for Wrapping Mechanisms**: Enhance these wrapping/unwrapping points to be aware of the backend used by the dataset or data array. This would mean either abstracting the wrap logic further or integrating checks to handle specific methods or operations based on the backend (determining whether to call `.compute`, `.chunk`, or other relevant methods specific to the backend).\n\n### Analysis of Unsuccessful Searches\nThe failure to find references to \"parallel compute\" suggests that parallel computation may not be centrally or explicitly annotated within the codebase, or it might be referred to using different terminologies or patterns.\n\n#### Further Exploration Needed\nGiven the specific feature request, it may be worth exploring more about how the current backend, primarily Dask, is configured and used for parallel computations:\n- Exploring the internal configuration and setup for Dask could illuminate how xarray generalizes backend configurations, which would be crucial for adding support for cubed or similar projects.\n- Considering the absence of direct references to an \"array API standard\" within `dataset.py` and the broader search for \"parallel compute,\" focusing on how backends are initialized and tied to computation methods might be more fruitful. This direction suggests looking into backend-specific modules or components (e.g., anything under a hypothetical `backends` directory, or configuration classes/methods that specify Dask as the backend).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis of `wrap` usage within xarray's dataset operations signals the need for backend flexibility at points where data is manipulated or analyzed. Incorporating alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed requires an adaptable approach to handling these backends, ensuring that operations are correctly executed according to the backend's capabilities and requirements. Adjustments or enhancements should respect existing functionality, offering a seamless transition or choice between Dask and other compatible backends. Further examination of backend configuration and management practices in xarray is recommended to build a robust solution for this feature request."

Here\u2019s the plan for the necessary locations to be updated or added, considering the intended behavior to resolve the issue:\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\n1. **Location 1**: \n   - File: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n   - Methods: `as_numpy`, `stack`, `map`, `pad`, `curvefit`\n   - Description: These methods include operations that might currently assume or directly work with Dask arrays.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Modify these methods to abstract the array operations such that they can dynamically accommodate arrays from different parallel execution frameworks like cubed. This might involve creating a layer or mechanism for identifying the backend of an array (Dask, cubed, etc.) and invoking methods (`compute`, `chunk`, etc.) specific to that backend. Ensure that if no backend is specified, operations default to assuming a Dask array, to preserve existing functionality.\n\n2. **Location 2**:\n   - File: `xarray/core/variable.py`\n   - Method: N/A (General approach for handling variables)\n   - Description: The `Variable` class manages data in xarray and interacts with computational backends for operations like chunking and computing.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Enhance the internal handling of `Variable` objects to be backend-agnostic, supporting operations over arrays from any parallel processing library conforming to the necessary interface (chunking, computing). This involves checking the array type and applying the correct chunking and computing methods based on the backend.\n\n3. **Location 3**:\n   - File: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n   - Class/Method: Potential need for a new method or class mechanism for backend management.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: If not already in place, introduce a new method or class that manages the setting or switching of computational backends for xarray datasets. This component should allow users to specify the desired backend (e.g., Dask, cubed) for their data processing tasks and handle the necessary setup and teardown for operations with those backends. This system should ideally work in a way that is transparent to the user, allowing them to switch backends with minimal changes to their code.\n\n### Note:\nWhile specific method names in `Location 1` and the concept in `Location 3` are explicitly identified, the actual implementation will require a detailed understanding of current xarray architecture and careful design to ensure backward compatibility and extensibility. The emphasis throughout is on preserving xarray's existing functionality while smoothly integrating the ability to work with diverse computational backends."
