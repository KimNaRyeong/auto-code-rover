Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding `timesince()` with `USE_TZ=True` and intervals greater than one month, we need to focus on specific areas mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. The `timesince()` method, particularly its behavior when handling time intervals greater than a month with timezone support enabled.\n2. The implementation details of `timesince()`, especially around the logic that handles datetime objects, to understand how timezone information is currently processed or missed.\n3. The test case that demonstrates the issue to understand the expected behavior and how it's failing with the current implementation.\n\nGiven these points, the following API calls will provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Locate the `timesince()` method to understand its current implementation and the surrounding code logic:\n   - `search_method(\"timesince\")`\n\n2. Since the issue description mentions a specific commit and points to a code snippet in the `timesince.py` file, we need to examine the code around the mentioned location to understand how datetime objects are handled:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/utils/timesince.py\", 93, 10)`\n\n3. It may also be helpful to locate the `TimesinceTests` class to see all the tests concerning the `timesince` function, particularly focusing on tests involving timezone support:\n   - `search_class(\"TimesinceTests\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive overview of how `timesince` is implemented, how it handles timezone information, and what kind of test coverage exists around this functionality. With this information, a patch can be more accurately developed to address the issue described."
