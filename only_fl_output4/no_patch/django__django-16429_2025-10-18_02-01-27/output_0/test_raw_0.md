To create a standalone Python script that reproduces the described issue regarding the `timesince` function when working with timezone-aware datetime objects over an interval of more than one month, we can simulate the Django test environment setup in a simplified manner. This script will directly invoke the `timesince` method with a datetime that triggers the issue under the conditions described (with `USE_TZ=True` and a datetime object from more than a month ago). If the issue is present, it will raise a `TypeError`, which we catch and print the stack trace for. The script exits with code 0 if the issue is resolved (meaning it does not raise an exception when it should not).

Please find the `reproducer.py` script below:

```python
import datetime
import sys

# This function is used to print a stack trace for the caught exception.
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Simulating part of Django's settings environment for this specific test.
from django.conf import settings
settings.configure(USE_TZ=True)

# Necessary Django setup for utilizing its utilities, such as timezone.
import django
django.setup()

from django.utils import timezone
from django.utils.timesince import timesince

def test_timesince_with_long_interval_and_tz():
    now = timezone.now()
    past_date = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)  # More than a month ago
    try:
        time_diff = timesince(past_date)
        print(f"timesince() returned: {time_diff}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 to indicate failure due to the issue.

    # Check if the timesince() function returns a string containing "month" to ensure it's working correctly.
    assert "month" in time_diff, "timesince() did not return a string with 'month' after more than a month interval."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_timesince_with_long_interval_and_tz()
    print("Test passed, no issue found.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no issue.
```

Ensure that you have Django installed in your environment (or virtual environment) where you are running this script, as it relies on Django's timezone and settings utilities. You can install Django using the following pip command if needed:

```sh
pip install Django
```

Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt using:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script should behave as expected:
- It will catch and print the stack trace of the `TypeError` if the issue is present.
- If the issue is fixed (meaning `timesince` can handle timezone-aware datetime objects correctly over intervals of more than a month), it will print "Test passed, no issue found."
