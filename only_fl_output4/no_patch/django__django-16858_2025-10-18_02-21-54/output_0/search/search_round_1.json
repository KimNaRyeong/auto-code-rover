        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

        "content": "Having collected the relevant code and context, let's analyze the findings:\n\n### Analyzing `JSONField` Class Implementations\n\n#### `django/forms/fields.py` and `django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py`\n- These files contain classes also named `JSONField`. However, one is part of Django's form handling, and the other is related to PostgreSQL's `jsonb` field for use in historical migrations. Neither of these is directly related to the reported issue, which focuses on model fields.\n- **Relation to Bug:** These classes are not related to the issue, as our concern involves model fields, specifically the behavior in database interaction, not form handling or PostgreSQL-specific implementations.\n\n#### `django/db/models/fields/json.py`\n- This is the correct `JSONField` class in question, which is used for defining JSON fields in Django models.\n- **What It Does:** The class provides a way to include a JSON field in a Django model, which includes serialization and deserialization of Python objects to and from JSON when saving to or loading from a database.\n- **Relation to Bug:** This class contains the `get_db_prep_value` method, which should ideally call `get_prep_value` to allow for custom handling of the JSON data before it's prepared for the database. This is where the issue stems from, as `get_prep_value` is no longer being called in Django 4.2, affecting custom `JSONField` behaviors that rely on it.\n\n### Analyzing `get_db_prep_value` Method\n\n- **What It Does:** The `get_db_prep_value` method prepares a value for insertion into the database. If the value is an instance of `expressions.Value`, it processes the value accordingly, particularly focusing on JSON decoding and warnings for deprecated behavior. Eventually, for JSON values not encapsulated in an `expressions.Value` and other non-SQL-expression values, it calls `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)`, which adapts the value for the database using the provided encoder.\n- **Relation to Bug:** This method is expected to prepare values for the database. According to the issue report, `get_prep_value` should be called somewhere in this process to allow customization of the JSON value preparation. However, the current implementation skips this call and directly adapts the JSON value for the database, bypassing potential custom logic in `get_prep_value`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Based on the issue description, the intended behavior would be to incorporate a call to `get_prep_value` before the value is finally adapted for the database. This would allow the `JSONField` to be extended and customized in ways similar to other field types in Django, following the principle of consistency and extendibility in Django's design.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue's description and the analyzed context, a potential solution would involve modifying the `get_db_prep_value` method in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` such that it calls `get_prep_value` on the value before passing it to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`. This change would restore the expected behavior that allows custom `JSONField` types to define their own pre-processing logic via `get_prep_value`.\n\nBefore proceeding with crafting a patch, it would be prudent to examine any related discussions or comments in the Django project (e.g., in the commit history or issue tracker) to ensure that there wasn't a specific reason for omitting the `get_prep_value` call. Since this behavior change was noted without a clear mention in the backwards-incompatible changes for Django 4.2, it's also important to ensure that reintroducing `get_prep_value` does not reintroduce any issues that might have led to its initial removal."

This should be done while preserving the existing functionality of handling instances of `expressions.Value` and other scenarios as currently implemented. Specifically, the method should adapt the value processed by `get_prep_value` instead of the unmodified `value` directly. This reintroduction ensures that custom JSON fields that override `get_prep_value` for pre-processing values before database insertion will work as expected. The modification can be conceptualized as follows:\n        ```python\n        # Before the final adaptation for the database\n        value = self.get_prep_value(value)  # This line to be added to utilize the custom get_prep_value logic\n        return connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)\n        ```\n    - This change maintains the method's responsibility for preparing JSON data for the database while restoring the ability for developers to customize how their JSON data is pre-processed through overriding `get_prep_value`."
