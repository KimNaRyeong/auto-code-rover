        "intended_behavior": "The `TranslateNode.render` method should include logic to handle formatting and interpolation of variables (especially floats) correctly within translation strings to prevent `TypeError`. This might involve explicitly converting floating-point numbers to strings in a manner compatible with gettext's expectations (for example, formatting floats to strings before interpolation). Another approach could involve adding safeguards to detect and appropriately handle the presence of floats (or other types that could lead to formatting errors) by either converting them to a compatible format or raising a more descriptive error. The implementation must ensure that these type adjustments do not impact the existing functionality to translate strings accurately based on the current language and context. This intended behavior aims to preserve the robustness and flexibility of Django's translation system while addressing the specific issue of type-related errors during string formatting."
