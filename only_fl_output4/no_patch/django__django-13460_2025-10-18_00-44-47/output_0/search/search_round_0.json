        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to string formatting errors when passing floats as values in `{% blocktrans %}` tags, especially with regard to the Django template system and its integration with gettext for internationalization, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. The class or method handling translation tags, specifically `blocktrans`, needs to be identified. As `blocktrans` is likely part of Django's template tag system related to internationalization, we might start by searching for a related class or method. However, since `blocktrans` is a template tag and not directly a Python class or method, we might need to look for the implementation handling the rendering or parsing of these tags in Django's templating engine:\n   - `search_method(\"do_translate\")`\n   - This is based on the issue description hinting at `do_translate` potentially throwing a `TypeError`. \n\n2. To understand how the `floatformat` filter is implemented and how it interacts with the `blocktrans` tag, finding the actual code implementation is necessary:\n   - `search_method(\"floatformat\")`\n   - Since `floatformat` is mentioned specifically as working fine when removed, seeing its implementation or handling could provide insights into the formatting issues.\n\n3. Given the nature of the issue revolves around the handling of different types (especially floats) within the context of string formatting for translations, it would be useful to examine how the system checks or should check variable types before formatting:\n   - `search_code(\"variable types before formatting\")`\n   - While this string is more of a conceptual search rather than a direct code snippet, it aims to get references related to type checking within the translation or formatting process.\n\nThese calls are aimed to target the areas of code most likely to be involved in or related to the issue reported, providing a comprehensive view of how Django's templating and translation system manage variables, specifically with float types and formatting within translation blocks."
