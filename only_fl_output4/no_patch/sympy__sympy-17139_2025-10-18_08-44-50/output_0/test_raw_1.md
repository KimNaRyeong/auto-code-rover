This `reproducer.py` aims to check if the issue (a `TypeError` with a specific message about an invalid comparison of complex `I` when attempting to simplify an expression involving `cos(x)**I`) is still present in the Sympy library. If the issue occurs, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If the issue does not occur (indicating a possible fix), it raises an `AssertionError` to fail the test, as this scenario indicates the expected issue was not reproduced, suggesting a correction to the problem.
