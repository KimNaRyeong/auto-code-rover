This script is designed to check explicitly for the occurrence of the specified issue (`Invalid comparison of complex I` error during the simplification process) and then handle it appropriately. If the expected error occurs, it prints the specific stack trace of the issue, leveraging the provided `print_stacktrace` function, to ensure clarity and detail in the error reporting. This approach aims to help diagnose the issue by providing a focused and clear readout of where and why the error happened within the codebase. If the script encounters an unexpected type of error, or if the expected error does not occur, it raises an `AssertionError` with a relevant message. This behavior ensures that the script signals a problem either way, whether by demonstrating the issue's occurrence or indicating an unexpected situation.
