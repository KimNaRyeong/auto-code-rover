        "intended_behavior": "The `TR6` function is intended to simplify trigonometric expressions involving complex exponents. Considering the issue with simplifying `cos(x)**I`, the intended behavior is to accurately handle expressions with complex exponents by applying the correct mathematical transformations that lead to simplification. This might involve using Euler's formula (`e^(I*theta) = cos(theta) + I*sin(theta)`) and other known trigonometric identities to transform and simplify the power expression `cos(x)**I`. The implementation should ensure no invalid comparison or operation is performed with complex numbers that might lead to exceptions or incorrect simplifications. The method must also preserve the existing functionality for all other types of inputs it rightly handles."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method is a high-level function that orchestrates various simplification strategies, including trigonometric simplification, power simplification, etc., depending on the nature of the expression. For resolving the issue, the intended behavior is to ensure that when `simplify` encounters an expression like `cos(x)**I`, it utilizes a strategy that can handle complex exponents correctly, invoking the necessary trigonometric and exponential rules for simplification. The fix should ensure that all simplification pathways that might be taken for such expressions are capable of properly handling and simplifying complex exponents without leading to errors or misinterpretations. It's crucial that the fix does not negatively impact the broad range of other expressions `simplify` is capable of handling, thus a careful enhancement or conditional logic might be needed to specifically address complex exponent cases."
