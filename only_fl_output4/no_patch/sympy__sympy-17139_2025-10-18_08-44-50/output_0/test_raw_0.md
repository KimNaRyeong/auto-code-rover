This script attempts to reproduce the reported issue with `sympy`. It first tries to execute the problematic code. If it encounters a `TypeError` with the expected message, it confirms the issue is still present and prints a formatted stack trace. Conversely, if the code executes without raising an exception, the script will assert false to indicate the issue is fixed. Notably, the script is structured to exit with code `0` in all cases, focusing on demonstrating the presence of the issue rather than influencing process exit behavior based on the issue's presence or resolution.
