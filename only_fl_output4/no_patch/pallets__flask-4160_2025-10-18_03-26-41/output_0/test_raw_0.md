Certainly! Below is the standalone script, `reproducer.py`, intended to reproduce the issue regarding the handling of `decimal.Decimal` and datetime types with Flask's JSON encoder. This script checks Flask's encoding capabilities by trying to serialize an object containing both `datetime` and `decimal.Decimal` values. It uses a custom JSON encoder as a workaround, as outlined in the provided issue description. Should the issue be present (i.e., failing to serialize the object properly without the custom encoder), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. Conversely, if the issue is fixed (i.e., Flask's default encoder can handle the object with no errors), the script exits with code 0.

```python
import decimal
import simplejson as sjson
from flask import Flask, json as fjson
from flask.json import JSONEncoder
from datetime import datetime


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


class CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, o):
        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):
            return str(o)
        return super().default(o)


app = Flask(__name__)
app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder

rdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')
rdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)

obj = {'datetime': rdatetime, 'decimal': rdecimal}

try:
    encoded = fjson.dumps(obj)  # Attempting to serialize with Flask's encoder
    assert 'decimal' in encoded and 'datetime' in encoded, "Flask JSON encoder didn't serialize the object properly."
    print("Issue is fixed: Flask JSON encoder can now handle both Decimal and datetimes.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)

# Testing serialization with both `simplejson` and Flask's encoder to confirm the nature of the issue
try:
    sjson_encoded = sjson.dumps(obj)  # Should fail due to datetime issue
except Exception as e:
    print("As expected, simplejson failed due to datetime issue:", e)

try:
    flask_encoded = fjson.dumps(obj)  # Should work if the issue is fixed
except Exception as e:
    print("Unexpected, Flask's encoder should handle both after the fix:", e)

exit(0)
```

Place this script in the root directory of your project. Execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py`. The expected behavior is clearly described in the comments: if Flask's JSON encoder can handle objects with both `decimal.Decimal` and `datetime` types successfully, the script will confirm the issue is fixed. If not, it will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the problem.
