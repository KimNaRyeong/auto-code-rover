The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)\n```python\nfrom flask import json as fjson\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\nimport simplejson as sjson\nimport decimal\nfrom datetime import datetime\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\n```\nThe custom encoder:\n```python\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\n'''\nAdd Decimal coverage\n'''\ndef default(self, o):\nif isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\nreturn str(o)\nreturn super().default(o)\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\n```\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.8.10\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context around the classes, methods, and pieces of code mentioned in the bug report. Specifically, we should focus on how Flask's JSON encoding currently handles types that are not natively supported by Python's built-in `json` module, such as `Decimal` and `datetime` objects. We should also investigate the customization of the JSON encoder in Flask, which seems to be crucial for supporting these types.\n\nTo achieve this, we will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the Flask `JSONEncoder` class to understand its current implementation and how it can be extended or modified to support `Decimal` types in addition to its existing capabilities.\n   \n2. Since the custom encoder extends Flask's `JSONEncoder`, we should look into the `default` method, as this is likely where the type checking and special handling occur. This will provide insight into how we can add support for `Decimal`.\n\n3. The code snippet provided suggests modifying the Flask app's JSON encoder directly (`app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder`). This implies interaction between the Flask application configuration and the custom JSON encoder. Searching for similar uses in the codebase might reveal how Flask facilitates the customization of JSON encoding for the whole application.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONEncoder\")`: To find the implementation of Flask's `JSONEncoder`, which we need to extend.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"JSONEncoder\")`: To inspect the `default` method of the `JSONEncoder` class where we can add our custom handling for `Decimal` types.\n- `search_code(\"app.json_encoder =\")`: To see how the Flask app's JSON encoder is typically customized or overridden in the project, offering insights into established practices or patterns that could influence our solution.\n\nThese calls should give us a solid foundation for understanding how to implement a patch that integrates `Decimal` handling into Flask's JSON encoding process."

This custom encoder appears to extend the default JSON serialization abilities provided by Python's standard library to handle Flask-specific or web-specific objects. \n\n1. **Functionality**: The `default` method of this class is designed to convert objects (`o`) into JSON serializable types if they are not natively supported by the standard JSON encoder. It explicitly checks for types such as `date` objects and `uuid.UUID`, converts dataclasses to dictionaries, and checks for a special `__html__` method to convert objects to a string format.\n\n2. **Relation to Bug**: This part of the code is directly related to the issue at hand, as the `Decimal` type is not natively supported by Python's built-in JSON encoding process. Since the Flask's `JSONEncoder` is already extending the `default` serialization process for certain types, integrating support for `Decimal` would logically extend this existing mechanism.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be to modify this `default` method to include an additional check for `decimal.Decimal` instances and appropriately convert them to a JSON serializable format (e.g., string representation of the decimal value). This would align with the current customization approach for handling other specific types like dates or UUIDs.\n\n### Analysis of `app.json_encoder =`\n\nSince the search for `app.json_encoder =` returned no results, it suggests that either the Flask application configuration for customizing the JSON encoder is not well-covered in the current codebase, or the approach for setting a custom JSON encoder is less conventional or documented. Given this, an alternative angle to understand how to properly configure or set a custom JSON encoder in a Flask app might be necessary. Usually, this involves assigning a subclass of `JSONEncoder` (that overrides the default behavior) to the Flask app's `json_encoder` attribute, a practice recommended by Flask documentation for custom JSON handling.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nGiven this analysis, a patch could include extending the existing `JSONEncoder` class's `default` method within Flask to handle `decimal.Decimal` types. Considering the lack of direct examples in the codebase for setting `app.json_encoder`, additional research or reliance on external documentation might be necessary to ensure the custom encoder can be seamlessly integrated into Flask applications.\n\nTo further gather context on potentially missing parts, additional API calls could be considered, such as:\n- Searching specifically for `JSONEncoder` usage within Flask application instances (`search_code(\"Flask.json_encoder\")`) to better understand the convention or patterns for setting custom encoders.\n- Further investigation into Flask documentation or source code might also be necessary to understand how to properly integrate and utilize custom JSON encoders in a Flask application, as the direct search did not yield relevant examples within the current codebase.\n"

The intended behavior is to check if the object `o` is an instance of `decimal.Decimal` and, if so, return its string representation. This adds to the existing functionality of handling specific types like dates, UUIDs, and dataclasses, ensuring that when the Flask application encounters a `Decimal` object during JSON encoding, it is serialized into a string. This string representation aligns with how `simplejson` treats `Decimal` objects and ensures compatibility with types that Flask's built-in JSON encoder does not support by default.\n     - The addition should preserve all existing functionality, extending support for `Decimal` without affecting the serialization of other supported types. The modification should take the form of a conditional check within the `default` method before falling back to the `super().default(o)` call for types not explicitly handled by this encoder."
