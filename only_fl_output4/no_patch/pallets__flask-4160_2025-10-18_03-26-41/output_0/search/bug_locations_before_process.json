        "intended_behavior": "The `default` method within the `JSONEncoder` class should be modified to include handling for `decimal.Decimal` types. The intended behavior is to check if the object `o` is an instance of `decimal.Decimal` and, if so, return its string representation. This adds to the existing functionality of handling specific types like dates, UUIDs, and dataclasses, ensuring that when the Flask application encounters a `Decimal` object during JSON encoding, it is serialized into a string. This string representation aligns with how `simplejson` treats `Decimal` objects and ensures compatibility with types that Flask's built-in JSON encoder does not support by default. The addition should preserve all existing functionality, extending support for `Decimal` without affecting the serialization of other supported types. The modification should take the form of a conditional check within the `default` method before falling back to the `super().default(o)` call for types not explicitly handled by this encoder."
