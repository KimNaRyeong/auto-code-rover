This callable should be executed to determine the path at runtime rather than at migration generation time. This change would allow the path to be dynamically determined based on the environment or other runtime conditions, preserving the existing functionality for static paths while adding the capability for dynamic resolution."

        "intended_behavior": "The `deconstruct` method should be adapted to handle the `path` attribute properly when it's provided as a callable. This adaptation involves serializing the callable's reference (or its output, depending upon the django's accepted approach for migration serializability and predictability) rather than the path itself if a callable is used. This ensures that migrations remain environment-agnostic and can be applied correctly across different setups without manual alterations."
