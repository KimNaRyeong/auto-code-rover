To correctly align with the requirements and correct the previous misunderstanding, we will create a new `reproducer.py` file that should raise an `AssertionError` only if the issue described is present. The previous script incorrectly raised an `AssertionError` due to a misunderstanding of the test's expected outcome. The updated script will properly test for the issue at hand and only raise an `AssertionError` if the `FilePathField` cannot handle a callable as its path argument, which is the crux of the issue.

    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)

Place this file in the root directory of your Django project, and run it with `python3 reproducer.py`. This script assumes:

1. You have a valid Django project setup.
2. Django is installed in your environment.

This script temporarily establishes a Django environment, then attempts to define and migrate a model with a `FilePathField` that uses a callable for its `path` argument. It expects to run without issues if the Django version or setup in question correctly handles callable paths for `FilePathField`. If the mechanism to enable a callable to set the path dynamically does not work (which reflects the current issue stated), this script either hits the `try` block's exception path, correctly catching and reporting the failure as intended, or successfully completes, indicating the absence of the reported issue.
