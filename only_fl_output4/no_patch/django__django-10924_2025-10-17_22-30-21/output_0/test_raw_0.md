Here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` which aims to reproduce the issue described. Just to recall, the issue is about allowing `FilePathField` path argument in Django models to accept a callable (in place of a direct path string) to dynamically set the path based on different environments or conditions.

Please note that for this reproducer to work, you need an existing Django project setup. Place this file in the root directory of your Django project (where `manage.py` is located) and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. 

```python
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models
from pathlib import Path

# Define a function to print stack trace for better error visibility
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# A temporary settings configuration to run our model creation script
SETTINGS = {
    'INSTALLED_APPS': [
        '__main__',  # Adding the standalone script as an app for simplicity
    ],
    'DATABASES': {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    },
    'BASE_DIR': Path(__file__).resolve().parent,
    'LOCAL_FILE_DIR': '/tmp',
}

def main():
    # Configure Django settings
    settings.configure(**SETTINGS)
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "__main__")

    # Ensure Django is ready to run
    import django
    django.setup()

    # Define a dynamic model to test the FilePathField with a callable
    class LocalFiles(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

        # Try to set the path as a callable
        def dynamic_path():
            return os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir')

        file = models.FilePathField(path=dynamic_path)

        class Meta:
            app_label = '__main__'

    try:
        # Attempt to make migrations including our dynamic path
        execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'makemigrations', '--dry-run'])

        # If no exceptions are raised, we assume the feature is already supported, which should not happen as of the current state
        raise AssertionError("FilePathField unexpectedly accepted a callable without raising an error.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please ensure that Django is installed in your environment (`pip install Django`), and you have a Django project set up. This script temporarily configures the Django settings necessary to create a model and attempts to generate migrations based on the model definition, expecting to hit an issue because Django's `FilePathField` does not officially support callable objects for the path parameter as of the knowledge cutoff date in December 2023.
