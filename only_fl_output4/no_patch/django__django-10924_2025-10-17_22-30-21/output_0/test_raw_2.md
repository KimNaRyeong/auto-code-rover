Based on the requirements to reproduce the stated issue, the following Python script aims to simulate the condition where Django's `FilePathField` receives a callable for its `path` argument, contrary to handling a static path. This version of the script will execute a model definition that attempts to use a callable as a path for `FilePathField`. If Django does not natively support this feature, it will result in an error, correctly reproducing the issue mentioned. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, thus unable to handle a callable for the `path` argument. Conversely, if the execution is successful and does not encounter issues, it implies that the issue has been resolved, and the script will exit normally with code 0.

```python
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models

from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class ReproducerAppConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'reproducer'
    label = 'reproducer'
    verbose_name = "Reproducer for FilePathField issue"

    def ready(self):
        # Define a model inside ready to ensure the app is fully loaded before model creation
        class LocalFiles(models.Model):
            name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
            file = models.FilePathField(path=lambda: os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))

            class Meta:
                app_label = 'reproducer'

    'INSTALLED_APPS': [
        '__main__.ReproducerAppConfig',

    },

        settings.configure(**SETTINGS)
        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "__main__")

        from django.setup import setup
        setup()

        # Attempting model migration which includes a FilePathField with a callable as the path argument
        execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'makemigrations', '--dry-run', '--verbosity', '3'])

        print("Migration command executed successfully. It seems the issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If execution reaches here, it likely means the issue still exists or another error occurred

**Notes:**

1. This script assumes you have Django installed in your environment and are running it in a directory where Django can programmatically manage applications and migrations.
2. The script dynamically sets up Django settings to avoid the need for a standalone Django project. This setup is simplistic and primarily aimed at testing the issue at hand.
3. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to output detailed error information, making it easier to diagnose the occurrence of the issue.
4. The script will try to simulate the behavior of Django processing a `FilePathField` definition with a callable path. If the callable is not accepted, the script will attempt to announce the failure clearly.

By running this script, you're performing an isolated test case to specifically observe Django's handling of a callable as a path argument for `FilePathField`, aiming to determine whether your Django project version or setup correctly allows or rejects this usage pattern, in turn validating the described issue.
