Given the feedback and the need for a more accurate reproduction of the specified issue including proper exception handling and verification, a corrected version of `reproducer.py` is provided below. This version explicitly checks for the correct handling of Greek letters in sympify calls in SymPy, addressing the reported issue more directly.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympify_greek_letter():
    from sympy import sympify, SympifyError
    try:
        # Sympify a unicode greek letter
        sympify(u"α")
    except SympifyError as e:
        # Print the stack trace if a SympifyError occurs
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError indicates the issue is present
        raise AssertionError("sympify(u'α') failed with SympifyError.") from None
    except Exception as e:
        # Test failed due to an unexpected exception type
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred which is not a SympifyError.") from None
    # If sympify(u'α') does not raise an exception, the issue cannot be reproduced
    print("sympify(u'α') completed successfully, issue may be fixed or not present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympify_greek_letter()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
        # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate a failure to reproduce the issue or another problem
        sys.exit(1)

    # Exiting with code 0 indicates the test did not reproduce the issue (may be fixed or absent)
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script focuses strictly on the issue where `sympify(u"α")` was not working, and attempts to accurately determine whether the issue can still be reproduced. Instead of assuming the specific output of `sympify`, it checks for failure in the attempt to sympify a unicode Greek letter. This accounts for the reported problem more directly than trying to match against an expected `Symbol` representation.
