        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more information about the relevant parts of the codebase mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we should look into the implementation details of `sympify`, the AST parser functionality, and how Greek letters are handled within SymPy. The following API calls will be useful for this:\n\n1. Search for the class where `sympify` might be defined or heavily used, as the issue mentions this function directly.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"sympify\")\n```\n\n2. The issue mentions a specific error occurring within a file related to the AST parser. Given the reference to `ast_parser.parse_expr`, it's prudent to locate this method to understand how expressions are parsed and where the process might be failing for Greek letters.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"parse_expr\")\n```\n\n3. The issue implies that there's an expectation for Greek letters (like \u03b1 when referenced in Python as \"\\u03b1\" or directly as the character) to be recognized and converted appropriately by `sympify`. To understand how character parsing and conversion are handled, locating any special handling for Greek letters or symbols is necessary.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Greek letters\")\nsearch_code(\"parse\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to piece together how the SymPy library attempts to convert string representations into symbolic expressions, specifically focusing on where this process may falter with Greek letter parsing."
