This script attempts to reproduce the specific issue related to SymPy's benchmarking utility failing due to an `ImportError`. When executed in an environment where the issue is present, it will print the stack trace of the error, making it clear which part of the code triggered the exception. The `assert` statement is used to ensure that the script only reports success in reproducing the error if the error message matches the expected one from the issue description. If you run this script in an environment where the issue has been resolved, it should exit with code 0 and print a message indicating that the issue seems to be fixed.
