This script is designed to attempt to reproduce the reported issue regarding input validation in clustering metrics within scikit-learn, specifically with the `mutual_info_score` function when passing arguments of `dtype=object`. 

- It uses `np.random.choice` to create an array of strings, explicitly casting it to `object` type, which is the scenario reported to cause the `ValueError`.
- It defines a function `print_stacktrace` to display a detailed error traceback, aiding in understanding where exactly in the stack the error occurs.
- The script aims to catch the exception related to the issue and asserts that the correct error message is contained within the exception. If the issue is correctly reproduced (i.e., the expected `ValueError` occurs), the script exits with code `0`, indicating success in issue reproduction.
- If no error is encountered or an unexpected error occurs, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating the failure to reproduce the issue as expected.
