When executed in an environment similar to the reported issue (presumably with a specific version of `scikit-learn` where the regression has occurred), it should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is not reproduced (indicating that the problem might have been solved in the library or the environment differs from the one reported).\n\nIt explicitly tests for both the scenarios: \n1. When `dtype=object` is used and should raise a `ValueError` indicating the issue is present.\n2. It also tries a scenario without `dtype=object` as a comparison, though this scenario's outcome doesn't influence the test's pass or fail status directly; it's more for context and verifying the behavior in both conditions. \n\nPlease ensure you have the necessary version of `scikit-learn` installed to test the reported issue accurately. Adjustments might be necessary if the library's behavior changes in future versions."
