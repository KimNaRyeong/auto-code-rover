The script checks the error condition that was reported. When executed in an environment similar to the reported issue (presumably with a specific version of `scikit-learn` where the regression has occurred), it should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is not reproduced (indicating that the problem might have been solved in the library or the environment differs from the one reported).

It explicitly tests for both the scenarios: 
1. When `dtype=object` is used and should raise a `ValueError` indicating the issue is present.
2. It also tries a scenario without `dtype=object` as a comparison, though this scenario's outcome doesn't influence the test's pass or fail status directly; it's more for context and verifying the behavior in both conditions. 

Please ensure you have the necessary version of `scikit-learn` installed to test the reported issue accurately. Adjustments might be necessary if the library's behavior changes in future versions.
