        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to explore the relevant sections of the Django codebase mentioned in the bug report. Since the traceback provides a clear path to the source of the exception, we will focus on the related classes, methods, and potentially where the error is being raised:\n\n1. Inspect the `DurationField` class in `django/forms/fields.py`.\n2. Examine the `to_python` method within the `DurationField` class for conversion logic.\n3. Look into `parse_duration` function in `django/utils/dateparse.py` since the exception is directly linked to it.\n4. Since the issue mentions a dictionary comprehension within `parse_duration`, obtaining context around that area could be crucial.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls are needed:\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"DurationField\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")` - To get details and context of the `DurationField` class.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DurationField\")` - To understand how `DurationField` attempts to convert input strings.\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"parse_duration\", \"django/utils/dateparse.py\")` - Direct examination of where the error occurs according to the traceback.\n4. `search_code_in_file(\"<dictcomp>\", \"django/utils/dateparse.py\")` - To get specific context around the dictionary comprehension that may be failing.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls."
