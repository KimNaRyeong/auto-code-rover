Correcting my approach to set up a minimal Django environment within a single script can be complex due to Django's reliance on its configuration and environment setup, such as `INSTALLED_APPS`, migrations, and the database configuration. Providing a script that bypasses or overly simplifies this setup could lead to inaccuracies or further complications. However, understanding your need, let's propose a revised approach to execute Django ORM code including models and queries in a standalone script to showcase the mentioned issue with `DecimalField`, `Case()`, and `ExpressionWrapper()` in a more precise manner:

**Please follow the steps below to prepare and run the script**:

1. **Ensure Django is installed in your environment**: If not installed, you can install Django using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

2. **Setup a basic Django project**: For the script to run, you'll need a basic Django project setup. If you're testing in an isolated environment or directly within an existing project, adjust the `manage.py` and settings accordingly.

3. **Prepare the Script**: Below is the revised standalone script, named `reproducer.py`. This script is adjusted based on your requirements and the earlier attempt, ensuring proper Django settings configuration, dynamic model creation, and migration handling to work around limitations encountered:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models, connection, migrations, OperationalError
from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor

APP_LABEL = 'test_app'

# Minimal Django settings necessary for running this script
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': 'test.db'}},
    INSTALLED_APPS=[APP_LABEL],
    ROOT_URLCONF=[],  # Required even if empty for Django >= 3.2
    SECRET_KEY='just-a-test-key',
    DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD='django.db.models.AutoField',  # Adjust based on Django version, this is for >= 3.2
)

from django.apps import apps
apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

# Define a dynamic model within the standalone script context
class Foo(models.Model):
    a = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    d = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)

    class Meta:
        app_label = APP_LABEL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_tests():
    try:
        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
            schema_editor.create_model(Foo)

        # Your testing logic here, for example:
        Foo.objects.create(a='', d=1)
        obj = Foo.objects.annotate(
            x=models.ExpressionWrapper(
                models.Value(1),
                output_field=models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2),
            ),
        ).filter(x__gt=0).first()

        if not obj:
            raise AssertionError("Expected to find a Foo instance but none was found.")
        
        print('Test successfully identified the presence of objects.')

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    finally:
        try:
            with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
                schema_editor.delete_model(Foo)
        except OperationalError:
            pass  # Model was not created or already deleted

if __name__ == '__main__':
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate', '--run-syncdb'])  # Ensure DB is prepared 
    run_tests()
```

4. **Run the Script**: Execute it using:

    ```bash
    python3 reproducer.py
    ```

This script bypasses Django's usual requirement for an app structure and migrations to a degree, by dynamically creating and deleting the model in the database. However, the usage of `execute_from_command_line()` for running migrations (`--run-syncdb`) is necessary to make sure Django is ready to manage models and execute queries.

**Caution**: This approach is tailored for testing and demonstrating the issue as described and should not be used as a pattern for regular Django development or applications due to overriding Django's standard project and application management systems.
