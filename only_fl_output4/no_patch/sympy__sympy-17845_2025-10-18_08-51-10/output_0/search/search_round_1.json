Its constructor allows specifying the start and end points and whether these points are included or excluded from the interval (controlled by `left_open` and `right_open` flags).\n   - The `FiniteSet` class represents a set of discrete finite elements. It is initialized with an arbitrary number of arguments representing the elements of the set.\n\n2. **Relationship With the Bug**:\n   - The issue pertains to the string representations (`__str__` method) of these classes, which are not directly found in the search results. This suggests that their string representations might be inherited from a parent class or handled by some other mechanism not directly implemented in `Interval` and `FiniteSet` classes themselves.\n   - The underlying problem is that printing these objects does not yield a string that can be evaluated to recreate the object, violating the principle that `str(object)` should result in valid code to create the object.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - For `Interval`, an ideal `__str__` method would produce strings like `Interval(0, 1)` for a closed interval from 0 to 1 or `Interval(0, 1, False, True)` for a half-open interval. This approach should maintain readability while adhering to the principle of evaluable `str(object)` output.\n   - For `FiniteSet`, even though its current `__str__` method apparently produces a readable and straightforward representation, ensuring it aligns with the principle of evaluable output might mean ensuring its string output would look something like `FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)` instead of `{1, 2, 3}`.\n\nGiven that direct searches for the `__str__` methods in these classes and for discussions around the principle of evaluable string output yielded no results, it might be useful to look into parent classes or utilities related to object representation in Sympy. Here are additional steps to consider:\n\n1. **Search for Parent Classes**: Since `Interval` and `FiniteSet` are subclasses of `Set`, examining `Set` and any mixins such as `EvalfMixin` might reveal where the `__str__` or any relevant representation methods are defined.\n   - `search_class(\"Set\")`\n   - `search_class(\"EvalfMixin\")`\n\n2. **Look for General Utilities or Functions**: Sometimes, string representations are handled by utility functions or in a more centralized manner, especially in a codebase like SymPy's which deals with symbolic math.\n   - `search_method(\"__str__\")`\n   - `search_code(\"__str__\")`\n\nThese steps can uncover more about how SymPy intends for objects to be printed and how that relates to the ability to reconstruct objects from their string representations."

Since such a method was not found through the search API, it indicates a need for its implementation or modification.\n   - **File**: sympy/sets/sets.py\n   - **Class**: Interval\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Implement or modify the `__str__` method to return a string that not only accurately represents the interval in a human-readable format but also adheres to the principle of generating evaluable Python code that can recreate the interval object, such as `Interval(0, 1)` for a closed interval from 0 to 1, and including the open or closed nature of each endpoint as needed, e.g., `Interval(0, 1, True, False)` for an interval open on the right.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: Similar modification is needed for the `FiniteSet` class, which likely inherits or defaults its string representation to a different method not directly implemented within the class itself. The `__str__` method or its equivalent must ensure that the string produced can be used to recreate the `FiniteSet` instance.\n   - **File**: sympy/sets/sets.py\n   - **Class**: FiniteSet\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Implement or modify the `__str__` method to output a string that represents the `FiniteSet` in a way that the output can be used as valid Python code to recreate the set. For example, `FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)` should be the output string rather than `{1, 2, 3}` to align with the principle of generating evaluable Python code.\n\nSince the direct implementation details and current handling mechanisms of string representations for these classes were not found in the provided excerpts, the described intended behavior assumes that the necessary modifications will include either the creation of these methods where they do not exist or the alteration of inherited or default behavior to meet the outlined requirements."
