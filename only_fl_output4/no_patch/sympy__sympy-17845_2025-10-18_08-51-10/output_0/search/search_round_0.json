        "content": "To address the issue related to `Interval` and `FiniteSet` printing, we will need to gather more context about the implementation of these classes and their string representation methods. Here are the search API calls that could help acquire the needed information:\n\n1. Search for the `Interval` class to understand its structure and current string representation method.\n   - `search_class(\"Interval\")`\n\n2. Search for the `FiniteSet` class to understand its structure and current string representation method.\n   - `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`\n\n3. The issue description mentions a concern with the string representation of `Interval` potentially including boolean values in its output (`\"Interval(0, 1, True, False)\"`). It would be useful to search specifically for the method that handles `Interval`'s string representation.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"Interval\")`\n\n4. Similarly, for `FiniteSet`, we will search for the method that handles its string representation.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n\n5. Lastly, because the issue touches on a principle that the `str(object)` output should be valid code for recreating the object, it would make sense to look for any existing discussions or code comments related to this philosophy within the project. This is a broader search that might capture comments in related classes or methods regarding string representations.\n   - `search_code(\"str(object) is valid code to create object\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide detailed information about how `Interval` and `FiniteSet` are currently implemented and represented as strings, any existing rationale in the codebase concerning their design, and insight into how the principle mentioned in the issue is applied throughout the project."
