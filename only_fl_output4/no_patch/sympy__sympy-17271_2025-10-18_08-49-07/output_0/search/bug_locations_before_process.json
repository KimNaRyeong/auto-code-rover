        "intended_behavior": "The `eval` method inside the `frac` function\u2019s context needs to handle the case when its argument is `zoo` (`S.ComplexInfinity`) more appropriately. Currently, it returns `None` when it encounters `S.ComplexInfinity`, leading to a `TypeError` downstream when trying to perform mathematical operations with `None`. To resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality of the code, the `eval` method should be modified to: - Either return a more informative error or message when `frac` is called with `zoo`, explicitly stating that the operation is undefined or not supported. This is under the assumption that a fraction part of a complex infinity (`zoo`) does not have a meaningful mathematical definition. - Or, if there's a convention or mathematical basis on which to define the fractional part of `zoo`, return that value instead of `None`. The existing checks and functionality for other types of arguments should remain unaffected by this change. The solution should solely add to or modify the branch dealing with `S.ComplexInfinity`, ensuring that any return value is consistent with the types expected by the rest of the SymPy framework and avoids causing `TypeError`."
