        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method called `_print_lerchphi` to the `PrettyPrinter` class. This method should carefully format the `lerchphi` function as 2D ASCII art. Given the nature of pretty printing, this function must take a `lerchphi` expression object as input and return a string that represents it in a human-readable, aesthetically pleasing format. The implementation should consider the unique characteristics of the `lerchphi` function (such as its arguments and mathematical significance) to ensure its pretty-printed representation is both accurate and informative. Since there's no existing method for `lerchphi`, adding this method will fill a gap in the pretty printing support for SymPy's mathematical functions, without affecting any existing functionality."
