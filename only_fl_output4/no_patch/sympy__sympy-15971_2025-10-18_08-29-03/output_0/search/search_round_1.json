        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us valuable insights into how we might approach adding pretty printing functionality for the `lerchphi` function. Let's break down the results and their relevance to the issue at hand.\n\n### 1. Result of `search_code(\"class PrettyPrinter\")`\n\nThe search result points to the `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. This class is described as a printer that converts an expression into a 2D ASCII-art figure, which directly relates to our goal of adding pretty print functionality.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **What it does:** This class likely orchestrates the pretty-printing process for various mathematical expressions, utilizing specific print methods tagged to different mathematical functions or objects.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since we need to add pretty printing for `lerchphi`, this class is where we would integrate such functionality, probably by adding a new method dedicated to handling `lerchphi`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Considering the issue description, we would expect to introduce a new method within `PrettyPrinter`, following the naming convention `_print_<function>`, specifically `_print_lerchphi`. This method would define how `lerchphi` expressions are transformed into pretty-printed ASCII art.\n\n### 2. Result of `search_code_in_file(\"def _print_\", \"pretty.py\")`\n\nThis result informs us that there are numerous `_print_` methods within `pretty.py`, but it does not specify how they are structured or what patterns they follow. The generic nature of the methods (`_print_`) suggests a consistent approach to defining pretty print functionality for various expressions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **What it does:** Each `_print_` method is tailored to a specific mathematical function or object, defining how to convert these entities into a visually appealing format.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This structure confirms that to support pretty printing for `lerchphi`, a new method named something like `_print_lerchphi` should be implemented, following the patterns and structures used by these existing pretty print methods.\n- **Intended Behavior:** This method will likely involve analyzing `lerchphi`'s structure, parameters, and properties to represent it aesthetically in text form.\n\n### 3. Result of `search_method(\"lerchphi\")`\n\nThe search did not find a method `lerchphi` in the codebase, which implies that while `lerchphi` might exist as part of the mathematical functions supported by SymPy, it has not been specifically adapted for pretty printing in `pretty.py`.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **What it does:** This absence indicates a gap in the pretty printing functionality offered by SymPy for `lerchphi`.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Directly relates to the issue at hand since our task is to fill this gap by providing the missing pretty print support for `lerchphi`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, adding `lerchphi` pretty print functionality will align it with other functions that have received similar treatment, ensuring consistency and completeness in SymPy's pretty print capabilities.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step would be to draft a `_print_lerchphi` method that adheres to the established patterns observed in other `_print_` methods within `pretty.py`. This involves understanding how `lerchphi` should be visually represented and implementing this in code using the `PrettyPrinter` class's capabilities and conventions. However, to proceed accurately, verifying the expected visual representation of `lerchphi` and any specific requirements or conventions for pretty printing in SymPy would be crucial."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This method should carefully format the `lerchphi` function as 2D ASCII art. Given the nature of pretty printing, this function must take a `lerchphi` expression object as input and return a string that represents it in a human-readable, aesthetically pleasing format. The implementation should consider the unique characteristics of the `lerchphi` function (such as its arguments and mathematical significance) to ensure its pretty-printed representation is both accurate and informative. Since there's no existing method for `lerchphi`, adding this method will fill a gap in the pretty printing support for SymPy's mathematical functions, without affecting any existing functionality."
