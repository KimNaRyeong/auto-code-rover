        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding adding pretty printing functionality for the `lerchphi` function, the following API calls seem necessary:\n\n1. Search for the specific file where pretty printing functions are located, assuming it could be `pretty.py` based on the description:\n   - `search_code(\"class PrettyPrinter\")`\n   - This can help us find where pretty print functionalities are implemented or extended, including the file path.\n\n2. After identifying the file, search for any existing pretty printing implementation for other functions that might be similar to `lerchphi` to understand the pattern or the structure of the implementation:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"def _print_\", \"pretty.py\")`\n   - This will give insight into how other mathematical functions are pretty-printed, providing a guideline for implementing `lerchphi`'s pretty printing.\n\n3. Since the issue mentions adding functionality specifically for `lerchphi`, it would be essential to find any existing `lerchphi` function implementations or references within the codebase to understand how it's currently handled:\n   - `search_method(\"lerchphi\")`\n   - Knowing how `lerchphi` is currently implemented or referenced might influence how its pretty printing is handled, especially if there are specific characteristics or parameters that need special consideration in the pretty printing process.\n\nThese selected API calls should provide a comprehensive context regarding the location of pretty print implementations and any current handling of the `lerchphi` function within the project."
