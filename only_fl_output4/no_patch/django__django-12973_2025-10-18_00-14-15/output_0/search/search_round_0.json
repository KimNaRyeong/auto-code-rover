We specifically need to look at how the error messages are generated and why the order of middleware insertion isn't enforced by the current checks. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Look into `AuthenticationMiddleware` and `SessionMiddleware` implementations** to understand their dependencies and the assertion that causes the given error. This will help us to identify where the hint about middleware order could be integrated or improved.\n   \n2. **Examine the system checks framework**, especially how it generates errors E408, E409, and E410. This is crucial to understanding why the middleware order isn't enforced or suggested in the errors message.\n\nWe'll need to perform the following searches:\n\n1. Search for the `AuthenticationMiddleware` class to inspect its dependencies and the method where the error is thrown.\n2. Search for the `SessionMiddleware` class to understand its implementation and role in the context of the `AuthenticationMiddleware`.\n3. Explore how the system checks (that produce errors E408, E409, and E410) are implemented. This will likely involve searching for how these specific errors are generated within the Django source code.\n\nHence, our API calls will be:\n\n- `search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")`\n- `search_class(\"SessionMiddleware\")`\n- `search_code(\"admin.E408\")`\n- `search_code(\"admin.E409\")`\n- `search_code(\"admin.E410\")`\n\nLet's proceed with these calls to gather the necessary information."
