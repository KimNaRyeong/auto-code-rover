        "intended_behavior": "Amend the `check_dependencies` function to include an additional check. After ensuring that both `AuthenticationMiddleware` and `SessionMiddleware` are present in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting, the function should also verify that `SessionMiddleware` is placed before `AuthenticationMiddleware`. If not, it should raise a new check error (could be a new error code like `admin.E411`) with a message advising the correct order. This preserves the current functionality of verifying middleware requirements for the admin app and extends it to include order verification, preventing the misconfiguration that leads to the runtime error described in the issue."
