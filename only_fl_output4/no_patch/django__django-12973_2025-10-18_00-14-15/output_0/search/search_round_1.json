Let's break down each part to address the key questions:\n\n### AuthenticationMiddleware (`django/contrib/auth/middleware.py`)\n\n1. **What it does:** This middleware is responsible for attaching the `user` object to every `request` object it processes. This allows your Django application to check the user's authentication status conveniently.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug:** The issue arises when this middleware is used without `SessionMiddleware` being placed before it in the middleware stack. `AuthenticationMiddleware` depends on the session framework to manage user sessions, and its correct operation is contingent upon the `SessionMiddleware` process request being called before its own.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** Ideally, there should be a system check warning users to insert `SessionMiddleware` before `AuthenticationMiddleware` in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting if both are used, especially since their correct sequential order is crucial for proper app functionality.\n\n### SessionMiddleware (`django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py`)\n\n1. **What it does:** This middleware manages sessions across requests, identifying requests with users, and storing data for those users as needed. It plays a key role in the authentication process by maintaining session data.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** Essential for `AuthenticationMiddleware` to function, its absence or misplacement (behind `AuthenticationMiddleware`) in the middleware stack leads to the raised AssertionError mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The middleware should be automatically checked for its presence and correct order relative to `AuthenticationMiddleware` within Django's system checks to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.\n\n### Checks (`django/contrib/admin/checks.py`)\n\n1. **What it does:** The provided snippets show system checks that ensure necessary middlewares are included for the Django admin to work correctly. These checks output errors E408, E409, and E410 when required middlewares are missing.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** These checks correctly flag missing middleware but do not enforce or suggest the correct order. Hence, a developer may add the required middleware in an incorrect sequence, leading to runtime errors despite passing the system checks.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The system checks should not only verify the presence of required middleware but also their order, particularly that `SessionMiddleware` comes before `AuthenticationMiddleware` to reduce the chance of runtime errors and enhance usability.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's evident that the issue stems from the system checks' failure to account for the correct middleware sequence. The fix should involve enhancing the Django system checks to include order verifications or at the very least, provide a warning about the correct order during the checks for `SessionMiddleware` and `AuthenticationMiddleware`, addressing the root cause highlighted by the issue description."

After ensuring that both `AuthenticationMiddleware` and `SessionMiddleware` are present in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting, the function should also verify that `SessionMiddleware` is placed before `AuthenticationMiddleware`. If not, it should raise a new check error (could be a new error code like `admin.E411`) with a message advising the correct order. This preserves the current functionality of verifying middleware requirements for the admin app and extends it to include order verification, preventing the misconfiguration that leads to the runtime error described in the issue.\n\n       The addition of this check is a direct response to the described issue by not only ensuring that both required middlewares are included for the admin app to function correctly but also that they are configured in the correct sequence to prevent runtime assertion errors concerning their dependencies."
