Since the server does not automatically close connections in this mode (as it waits for keep-alive connections to close), adding logic to detect the end of a request and close the connection if the server is running with `use_threading = False` should resolve the issue."

Specifically, ensuring `WSGIServer` adapts its connection handling based on threading settings would prevent the server from becoming unresponsive when running with `--nothreading`."
