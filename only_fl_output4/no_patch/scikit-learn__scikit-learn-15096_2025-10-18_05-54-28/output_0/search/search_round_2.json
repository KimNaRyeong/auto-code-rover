I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

This finding narrows down where we should look into the source code to understand how it operates, especially in relation to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **Absence of the `fit` Method in `GridSearchCV`**:\n   - The inability to find the `fit` method directly within `GridSearchCV` suggests that this functionality might be inherited from a base class (`BaseSearchCV`) or the method's implementation does not directly match the search string due to dynamic or abstracted behavior. Given the nature of `GridSearchCV`, the `fit` method is crucial as it orchestrates the fitting of models across the provided parameter grid. Hence, not finding it directly means we may need to explore the base class or related classes/methods that contribute to this functionality.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `cv_results_['params']`**:\n   - The code snippets containing `cv_results_['params']` are spread across documentation and examples, including a couple of instances in the same file where `GridSearchCV` is defined. This code plays a central role in storing the parameters that were used for each iteration of model training within a grid search. Since the issue highlights that `cv_results_['params']` unexpectedly includes fitted estimators, leading to excessive memory use, we need to understand how and where this array is populated. The relationship to the bug is direct: if these entries erroneously hold references to fitted model instances, they would naturally inflate the memory footprint significantly.\n\nGiven the issue description and intended behavior, parts of the code that manipulate `cv_results_`\u2014especially those that assign values to `cv_results_['params']`\u2014should be scrutinizing estimators' parameters without retaining fitted models themselves. Ideally, parameters defining a model configuration should be saved in a manner that does not include large, fitted model objects unless explicitly intended.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context**:\n- Investigate the base class `BaseSearchCV` to find the `fit` method or any methods that lead to the population of `cv_results_['params']`.\n- Specifically, examine how `_search.py` handles the creation and updating of `cv_results_`, focusing on the process that could inadvertently store fitted models.\n\nAccordingly, we should perform the following API calls for more context:\n- search_class_in_file(\"BaseSearchCV\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"_run_search\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"cv_results_['params']\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")"

        "content": "Given the collected context from the search results, let's analyze the relevant portions of the code:\n\n1. **`BaseSearchCV` class (in `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`)**:\n   - **What it does**: This abstract base class defines the core structure for performing hyperparameter search with cross-validation, including the method `_run_search` which should be implemented by subclasses like `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. The `fit` method in this class manages the overall fitting process, including the scoring of parameters, selection of the best set of parameters, and refitting the estimator on the whole dataset using the best found parameters.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The issue is likely to be associated with how the `cv_results_['params']` attribute is populated within the fitting process, specifically, it may relate to the cloning and handling of estimator parameters during cross-validation cycles.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior here is that `cv_results_['params']` should store only the parameters of the estimators, not the fitted estimators themselves. The actual parameter values should be cloned from the input parameter grid without preserving state or fitting artifacts from the evaluation process.\n\n2. **Implementation of `_run_search` in `GridSearchCV`**:\n   - **What it does**: For `GridSearchCV`, the method simply evaluates all parameter combinations provided in `param_grid`. It initializes this evaluation by passing these parameters to the `evaluate_candidates` function.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: This is a critical piece since it's here that the iteration across different parameter combinations happens. However, the bug is likely not in the iteration logic itself but in the handling of the parameters during or after evaluation (cloning vs. using fitted instances).\n   - **Intended behavior**: Ensure that during the parameter evaluation process, the estimators are cloned correctly and only their parameters (not the fitted instances) are passed to `cv_results_['params']`.\n\n3. **Populating `cv_results_['params']`**:\n   - **What it does**: Snippets mention how `search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]` is used to obtain the parameters of the best model. This indicates that `cv_results_['params']` holds a record of parameters for all evaluated models.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: This direct mention of `cv_results_['params']` touches the core of the issue. The concern is with how each entry in this mapping gets populated during the search.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Ensure the population of `cv_results_['params']` involves storing parameters in a way that doesn't accidentally include references to fitted estimator objects. This could be achieved by explicitly cloning parameter values from the candidate parameter dicts before passing them to the fitting process, thereby ensuring that `cv_results_` only contains unfitted, clone copies of the parameters, not references to fitted objects.\n\nThe key to resolving the issue involves accurately understanding and potentially modifying the mechanisms of parameter handling and the population of `cv_results_` to ensure that parameters are stored without including heavyweight, fitted estimators, especially in single-threaded (`n_jobs=1`) scenarios. This modification should carefully preserve existing functionality, such as the ability to refit the best estimator and access its parameters via `cv_results_['params']`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This attribute should only contain unfitted parameter values and not include references to fitted objects. The problem arises if the parameter handling mechanism inadvertently stores fitted estimator objects instead of their specifications.\n  - **Intended behavior**: Modify the implementation to ensure that only the parameters of the estimator before fitting are included in `cv_results_['params']`. This will likely involve ensuring that cloning of estimator parameters occurs before they are passed to the fitting process. This modification should preserve the ability to access the parameters of each evaluated combination through `cv_results_['params']`, without significantly altering the memory footprint.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n  - **Class**: `BaseSearchCV`\n  - **Method**: `fit`\n  - **Description of the issue**: The `fit` method is where the actual fitting process of the estimator with the given parameters takes place. There may be an oversight in how the estimator's parameters are handled or cloned during the execution of the grid search, especially when recording these parameters in `cv_results_`.\n  - **Intended behavior**: Ensure that the `fit` method or associated methods involved in the fitting process (potentially `_run_search` or called functions therein) accurately clone estimator parameters at the start of the process. As part of this, verify that any parameter manipulation preserves the unfitted state of such parameters for inclusion in `cv_results_['params']`. It's crucial that the fitting process does not alter the intended functionality of returning the best estimator along with a comprehensive summary of all evaluations performed, without carrying the additional weight of fitted models in `cv_results_`.\n\nThese modifications should address the core issue of avoiding the unintended storage of fitted models within `cv_results_['params']` and thereby potentially reduce the excessive memory usage experienced during grid search procedures, especially in single-threaded scenarios."
