        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Partition Class Context**: The `Partition` class in `sympy/combinatorics/partitions.py` extends `FiniteSet`. It doesn't directly implement `__str__` or `__repr__` methods, which suggests that it inherits its string representation from `FiniteSet` or a parent class. This is why the string representation is quite verbose, as described in the issue.\n\n2. **Permutation Class Context**: The `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` has a more detailed implementation with various properties and methods. The presence of `__repr__` but no direct information about `__str__` indicates it also may rely on inherited behavior for its string representation, unless `__repr__` is specifically overridden for custom printing. Given that `__repr__` usually returns an unambiguous string representation of an object for debugging, while `__str__` is intended for a more readable representation, the focus might need to be on customizing `__str__` or adjusting `__repr__` for both classes to align with the issue request.\n\n3. **Relation to the Issue**: The issue suggests that the string representation of objects from classes like `Partition` is unnecessarily verbose due to them being subclasses of SymPy types, specifically `FiniteSet` for `Partition`. The verbose printing featuring `FiniteSet` is likely inherited from a common ancestor or the direct result of not having a custom `__str__` or `__repr__` method. \n\n4. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior as per the issue description is to have a less verbose and more intuitive string representation of `Partition` (and potentially `Permutation`) objects. Instead of showing someting like `Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2))`, it would be preferable to show something like `Partition([1,2])` or `Partition({1,2})`. This requires implementing or modifying the `__str__` or `__repr__` methods to check the object's type and format the string accordingly.\n\nGiven that direct searches for `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in `Partition` did not yield results, and considering that these methods control the string representation of an object, it seems necessary to:\n\n- Investigate if there's a generic way these representations are handled in SymPy, possibly through a common base class for `FiniteSet` or in the `Atom` class for `Permutation`.\n- Since `Partition` specifically extends `FiniteSet`, we should look into how `FiniteSet` handles its string representation. This might give us clues on how to implement a more concise `__str__` or `__repr__` that can be either overridden in the `Partition` class itself or, if possible, in a more generic way that affects all relevant combinatoric classes.\n\nTo proceed, I suggest:\n\n- Searching for `__repr__` or `__str__` methods in the base classes for `Partition` and `Permutation`, starting with `FiniteSet` and `Atom`.\n- Investigate how `FiniteSet` constructs its string representation, as this could provide a template or hook for customization.\n\nLet's make these API calls:\n\n- search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"FiniteSet\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"Atom\")"

Since there's no specific `__str__` or `__repr__` method present, a new method (or both) should be added or modified if they're inherited from a base class, not directly listed here. The intended behavior of this new method should tailor the string representation of `Partition` instances to be less verbose, displaying elements as a simple list or set notation (`Partition({1, 2})` or `Partition([1, 2])`) without the unnecessary inclusion of `FiniteSet`, thus preserving the functional aspects while improving readability.\n\nLocation 2: File: sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py, Class: Permutation. Although there is a mention of a `__repr__` method, depending on how it currently represents objects, it might need modifications to align with the proposed improvements. The `__str__` method could be added or modified to ensure that the string representation of `Permutation` instances is more user-friendly and less verbose. The intended behavior should clearly convey the permutation in a concise and understandable way, potentially aligning with the formatting improvements suggested for `Partition` where applicable and relevant."
