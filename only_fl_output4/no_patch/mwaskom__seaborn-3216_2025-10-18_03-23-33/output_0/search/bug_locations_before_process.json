        "intended_behavior": "This method should differentiate between a `Figure` and a `SubFigure` target more effectively to preserve figure-level attributes like titles when plotting on subfigures. Specifically, the assignment `figure = target.figure` for a subfigure should be updated to treat `target` as the `figure` itself when dealing with a `SubFigure`. This would ensure that operations on a subfigure do not inadvertently affect or disregard the properties of the parent figure. The intended behavior is to modify the logic to:\n  - Retain the ability to handle both `Figure` and `SubFigure` targets.\n  - Update the current handling of subfigures to avoid altering the parent figure's attributes inadvertently (e.g., `figure = target` when `target` is an instance of `SubFigure`).\n  - Ensure that seaborn's plotting functions can be applied directly to subfigures without losing or ignoring figure-level configurations such as the title.\n  - The modification should be carefully tested to confirm that it does not unintentionally impact other functionalities or use cases within seaborn, especially those that rely on the existing behavior for managing figures and subfigures."
