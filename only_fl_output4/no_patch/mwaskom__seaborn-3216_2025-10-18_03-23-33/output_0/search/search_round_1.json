Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from the API calls provides essential insights into the issue and its potential resolution:\n\n1. **Analysis of the `Plot` Class in `seaborn/_core/plot.py`:**\n   - The `Plot` class is the core of seaborn's object-oriented API, which simplifies the creation and manipulation of plots. The `on` method of the `Plot` class accepts targets like `Axes`, `SubFigure`, or `Figure`. This design supports the integration with matplotlib objects, including subfigures, which are relatively new in matplotlib (added in version 3.4).\n   - **Relation to the Bug:** The issue description implicates the interaction between seaborn plots and matplotlib subfigures as the cause for the figure title being removed. The `Plot` class's flexibility to operate on various targets, including subfigures, is directly related to the reported issue.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** When seaborn plots are rendered on a subfigure, all figure-level properties, such as titles, should be preserved. This ensures that users can leverage seaborn's advanced plotting capabilities without sacrificing core matplotlib features.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Code Around Line 186 in `_core/subplots.py`:**\n   - The examined code reveals the logic seaborn uses to initialize figures or subfigures based on the target provided to its plotting functions. Specifically, it distinguishes between traditional figures and subfigures (`mpl.figure.SubFigure`), introduced in matplotlib 3.4, ensuring backward compatibility and extended support for newer matplotlib constructs.\n   - **Relation to the Bug:** The issue arises in this precise context, where seaborn's handling of subfigures inadvertently omits setting or preserving the parent figure's title when plotting on a subfigure. The code snippet suggests seaborn tries to encapsulate the parent figure of a subfigure (`figure = target.figure`) for some reason, which might be leading to the loss of the figure-level title.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The logic should ensure that when seaborn plots on a subfigure, it doesn't disrupt figure-level attributes, particularly the title. The user's suggestion to change `figure = target.figure` to simply refer to `target` implies a need for seaborn to treat subfigures as the primary plotting target without defaulting to their parent figure unless necessary. This approach could help maintain the integrity of figure-level properties like titles.\n\n3. **Overall Implication for Resolving the Issue:**\n   - To address the bug, seaborn's handling of subfigures (and potentially figures) needs a nuanced adjustment. Specifically, when operating with subfigures, seaborn must ensure that figure-level attributes are not discarded or overridden unless explicitly intended by the user. The proposed change (`figure = target.figure` to `figure = target`) in `_core/subplots.py` appears to be a step towards respecting and maintaining the hierarchical structure of figures and subfigures in matplotlib, especially regarding properties like the figure title.\n\nGiven this analysis, further validation and testing would be required to ensure that the suggested change does not introduce other side effects, especially in complex plotting scenarios involving multiple subfigures or nested configurations. The next steps would involve implementing the proposed solution, followed by thorough testing with diverse plotting configurations to ascertain its effectiveness and robustness."

Specifically, the assignment `figure = target.figure` for a subfigure should be updated to treat `target` as the `figure` itself when dealing with a `SubFigure`. This would ensure that operations on a subfigure do not inadvertently affect or disregard the properties of the parent figure. The intended behavior is to modify the logic to:\n       - Retain the ability to handle both `Figure` and `SubFigure` targets.\n       - Update the current handling of subfigures to avoid altering the parent figure's attributes inadvertently (e.g., `figure = target` when `target` is an instance of `SubFigure`).\n       - Ensure that seaborn's plotting functions can be applied directly to subfigures without losing or ignoring figure-level configurations such as the title.\n       - The modification should be carefully tested to confirm that it does not unintentionally impact other functionalities or use cases within seaborn, especially those that rely on the existing behavior for managing figures and subfigures."
