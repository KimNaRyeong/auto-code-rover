Given the limitations from the previous attempt and the specificity of the task, let's make an adjustment that considers the presence of necessary libraries and provides an accurate reproduction of the issue. Below is an updated standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def check_for_title(figure):
    """Return True if the figure has a title, False otherwise."""
    # Matplotlib versions may store the suptitle differently; check common attributes
    if hasattr(figure, '_suptitle') and figure._suptitle:
        return True
    if hasattr(figure, 'texts'):
        # Some versions may store suptitle as part of figure texts
        for text_obj in figure.texts:
            if text_obj.get_text() == 'Test title':
                return True
    return False


def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import seaborn.objects as so
    
    try:
        fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
        p = (
            so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
            .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
        )
        p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()
        
        ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
        ax.scatter([1],[1])
        
        fig.suptitle("Test title")
        
        # To ensure that the figure is properly updated before check
        fig.canvas.draw_idle()
        has_title = check_for_title(fig)
        
        # AssertionError if title is missing
        assert has_title, "Figure title is missing."
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if assertion fails
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if any other exception occurs
    
    print("No issue found: the figure title is set correctly.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code when no issue is found


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure that your Python environment has `matplotlib` and `seaborn` installed before running this script. If they are not installed, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

The script is designed to exit with code 1 if the issue (figure title missing when using seaborn's objects API with subfigures) is reproduced, showing a stack trace of the point of failure. If the issue isn't encountered, it will print "No issue found: the figure title is set correctly" and exit with code 0, signaling that the environment or seaborn's behavior might have changed such that the issue can no longer be reproduced.
