This involves ensuring that the method (and any utility function it calls for URL manipulation) does not exclude non-HTTP schemes from processing. Specifically, the merging of parameters (params=merge_setting(request.params, self.params)) should apply uniformly across all URL schemes. The method should either include a check to allow certain non-standard, yet HTTP-like schemes, or implement a more robust scheme recognition process that can be customized or extended through a registry mechanism as suggested in the issue. This approach allows http+unix and similar schemes to be treated with HTTP-like parameter processing, without compromising the security considerations of excluding unknown schemes by default."

        "intended_behavior": "While exact methods within these files were not pinpointed from the context gathered, modifications in these files should aim to ensure the parsing of URLs (parse_url or related methods) accurately retains and processes the query parameters even for non-standard schemes. This might involve refining how URL components are extracted and how schemes influence the handling of the rest of the URL. For parse_url and any method that plays a role in identifying and working with URL schemes, ensure they facilitate appending parameters to or retaining them for unfamiliar schemes. If parse_url is found to improperly handle or recognize non-standard schemes, its logic should be adjusted to parse such URLs accurately, enabling downstream processing (such as parameter merging) to function correctly."
