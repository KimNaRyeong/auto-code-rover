        "intended_behavior": "Within the context of the `PyFunction` class in `sphinx/domains/python.py`, the handling of default values in function signatures should be adjusted or ensured to preserve the formatting as specified in the source code. Specifically, when representing default values in documentation:\n\n- When a default value is provided in hex format (e.g., `0xffffff`), this representation should be maintained in the generated documentation, rather than converted to decimal or any other format.\n- The system that extracts and renders these default values into the documentation output should include a check or processing step that recognizes and preserves hexadecimal notation, along with other literal formats, to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the source code's intent.\n- This might involve enhancing the logic that parses and formats function signatures within the `PyFunction` class or related utility functions within Sphinx that handle such representations.\n- Additional unit or integration tests should be developed to cover cases of function definitions with various default argument formats to ensure this behavior is preserved in future releases.\n\nThis approach maintains the existing functionality of the code while correcting the specific issue related to the representation of default argument values. It ensures that the documentation generated by Sphinx remains an accurate and intuitive reflection of the source code, particularly in cases where specific formats (like hexadecimal) are used for clarity or convention."
