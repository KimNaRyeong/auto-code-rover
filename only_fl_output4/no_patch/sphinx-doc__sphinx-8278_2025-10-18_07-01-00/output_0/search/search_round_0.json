The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how Sphinx processes the documentation for function definitions, especially how it converts default arguments into documentation. The description mentions how hexadecimal defaults are being converted into decimal values in the generated HTML documentation.\n\nGiven the problem description, we might want to focus on the parts of Sphinx that handle function documentation parsing and HTML rendering, particularly where default argument values are interpreted or transformed. Since Sphinx is a Python-based tool for generating documentation, it's likely that the issue arises in a specific module dedicated to parsing docstrings or rendering the corresponding documentation output.\n\nLet's begin by exploring relevant classes or methods involved in the rendering process of function documentation.\n\n1. **Searching for a class or method that handles function documentation rendering:** Sphinx uses domains to separate different languages and types of documentation (such as Python, C++, etc.). The Python domain might have methods or classes specifically designed for rendering function documentation. Thus, relevant classes or methods could be named something like `PythonFunction`, `FunctionDirective`, or have \"function\" in their name. Since we don't have an exact class or method name, let's search for methods related to function handling in the entire codebase:\n\n   - `search_method(\"function\")`\n\n2. **Searching for a method or class that could handle default values in arguments:** We expect a method or class that specifically parses or handles the default values provided in the function definitions. This might not necessarily be limited to Python functions but could also be a more generic handler for argument values. We can look for methods with names suggestive of handling default values or argument parsing:\n\n   - `search_method(\"default\")`\n   \n3. **Exploring code related to rendering or converting number systems:** Since the issue involves changing number systems (hexadecimal to decimal), Sphinx might use specific utility functions or methods for converting number formats or handling number literals. Looking for such code snippets could help us locate the exact spot where the conversion is unintentionally applied. This probably involves generic methods for number handling, so:\n\n   - `search_code(\"hex\")`\n   - `search_code(\"decimal\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a good starting point for identifying where in Sphinx's codebase the issue might originate, specifically focusing on function documentation parsing/rendering, handling of default argument values, and the conversion of number systems."
