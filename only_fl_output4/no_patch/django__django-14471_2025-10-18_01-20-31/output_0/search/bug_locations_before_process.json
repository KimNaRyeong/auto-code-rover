        "intended_behavior": "To address the issue, `_get_token` should be adjusted so that it does not proceed to generate a new token upon catching an `InvalidTokenFormat` exception raised by `_sanitize_token`. Instead, it should allow the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception to propagate. This change would enable `process_view` (or other calling contexts) to handle the exception appropriately by rejecting the request early without the additional, unnecessary steps of token regeneration. This exception handling strategy contributes directly to a more efficient request processing path, specifically for requests with invalid CSRF tokens, adhering to the fail-fast principle."

        "method": "process_view",
        "intended_behavior": "`process_view` should include an exception handling block specifically for `InvalidTokenFormat`. Upon catching this exception, it directly rejects the request using the reason included in the exception (e.g., incorrect length or invalid characters of the CSRF token). This behavior ensures a clearer and more immediate response to requests with invalid CSRF tokens, streamlining the middleware's protection mechanism against CSRF attacks and enhancing the debugging experience for developers. This update logically follows the more precise exception handling suggested for `_get_token`, completing the handling pathway for invalid token formats.\n\nThese modifications preserve the existing functionality of the CSRF protection mechanism while improving its efficiency and security posture in line with the issue's description."
