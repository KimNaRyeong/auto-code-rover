        "content": "<issue>Reject requests earlier if the CSRF cookie token has the wrong format\nDescription\n(last modified by Chris Jerdonek)\n(This issue is similar to #32795 but for the cookie token rather than for the non-cookie token.)\nI noticed in CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view() that if the CSRF cookie has the wrong format (i.e. wrong length or contains invalid characters), then the code will do a fair amount of unnecessary work. Specifically, the code will proceed inside _get_token() at \u200bthis line to use Python's secrets module twice to generate both a new token and a mask for the token. But this new token will only be used for the purposes of later calling _compare_masked_tokens() in a way that will be guaranteed to fail (since the cookie being used will be brand new and so won't match). And then it will call _compare_masked_tokens() with that value.\nInstead, if the CSRF cookie is found at that line to have the wrong format, the middleware could reject the request outright similar to how #32795 does it if the token has the wrong format (as well as similar to how the code currently handles a missing cookie in the \u200blines after). I think this will simplify CsrfViewMiddleware and make it easier to understand because it will eliminate a number of steps that aren't needed for security. In particular, one thing this will do is cut down on the number of places where _get_new_csrf_token() is called, which will make it clearer where a new value is really needed / used. Similar to #32795, it will also make troubleshooting easier because the rejection messages will be more specific.\nI think this could be implemented as follows. After #32795 is merged, \u200b_get_token() could be changed to allow InvalidTokenFormat to bubble up instead of handling it. Then the InvalidTokenFormat exception could be handled differently in the two places _get_token() is called: (1) In process_request(), it could be handled by calling _get_new_csrf_token() (_get_token()'s current behavior). (2) In process_view(), it could be handled similar to how #32795 handles it. Namely, reject the request using the InvalidTokenFormat's reason string.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary code context to address the issue related to CSRF token format validation in Django's CsrfViewMiddleware, we should make use of the search APIs effectively. Given the information from the issue, let's plan our API calls as follows:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions `CsrfViewMiddleware`, we should start by searching for this class to understand its structure and context within the project.\n2. The issue specifically references `CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view()` and mentions the usage of `_get_token()`, so we should locate and understand these methods next.\n3. We should find where `InvalidTokenFormat` is raised within `_get_token()` because the resolution involves changing how this exception is handled.\n4. The issue description alludes to the behavior within `process_request()` and `process_view()` in terms of handling the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception. Therefore, we need context on these methods as well.\n5. Since the issue description mentions the use of Python's `secrets` module for token generation, it would be helpful to see where `_get_new_csrf_token()` is used, as this is likely where the `secrets` module is utilized.\n\nBased on this plan, the following API calls will give us the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CsrfViewMiddleware\")` to find the class within the project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"process_view\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")` to get information on the `process_view` method within `CsrfViewMiddleware`.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_get_token\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")` to examine how `_get_token` is implemented.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"_get_new_csrf_token\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")` to understand where and how a new CSRF token is generated.\n5. `search_method_in_class(\"process_request\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")` to get details on the `process_request` method as it is relevant to how exceptions might be handled differently post-fix.\n\nLet's start with these API calls to gather the code context required for addressing the issue."
