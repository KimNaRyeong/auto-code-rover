I'm not sure how to get the same behavior than Sympy for `x=0`, but at least it would be compilable.\n</issue>"

Search for the `fcode` function in the entire codebase since `sp.fcode(sp.sign(x))` is directly involved in this issue. This should help understand how the `sign` function is being converted to Fortran syntax.\n   \n   `search_method(\"fcode\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the same behavior is obtained with `sympy.utilities.codegen`, I shall search for the relevant classes and methods within the `codegen` module which might be responsible for handling the `sign` function or its Fortran conversion. This could include looking into classes or methods related to Fortran code generation within the `codegen` module.\n\n   `search_class(\"codegen\")`\n\n3. As the `sign` function's translation to Fortran syntax is the core issue, it would also be wise to directly search for instances where `sign` function is explicitly mentioned or handled in the codebase. This could potentially lead us directly to the part of the code that needs modification.\n\n   `search_code(\"sign(x)\")`"
