        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to improving error messages for incorrect context processors in Django, we need to look into several pieces of the Django codebase as mentioned in the issue description. Here are the API calls:\n\n1. To understand the current implementation and where the TypeError is raised when a NoneType is encountered:\n   - `search_code(\"updates.update(processor(self.request))\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a comparison with how Django handles views that return `None`, let's also look into how Django raises the error message for views to use it as a reference for improving context processor error handling:\n   - `search_code(\"The view didn't return an HttpResponse object. It returned None instead\")`\n\n3. The issue talks about the traceback involving certain key files and methods. We should gather more context about these to identify where exactly the improvement can be implemented. Specifically, we know about the `bind_template` method in a context-related class and the `render` method in both `django/template/backends/django.py` and `django/template/base.py` file paths. To get more context on these, let's use:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"bind_template\", \"django/template/context.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"render\", \"django/template/backends/django.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"render\", \"django/template/base.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with sufficient code context to start working on a patch that will improve the error messaging for incorrect context processors in Django, by catching the specific situation where a context processor returns `None` instead of the expected dictionary and raising a more informative error message."
