Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding about where `OperationalError` is imported from in Django. `OperationalError` should be imported from `django.db.utils` instead of `django.core.exceptions`. Here's a correction to the previous script that addresses this mistake.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, utils

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],
    SECRET_KEY='fake-key-for-testing',
)

django.setup()

# Initial models setup
class Bar(models.Model):
    pass

class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.ManyToManyField(Bar, blank=True)

# Mimic the behavior of updating models and attempting to migrate changes
try:
    # Attempting to programmatically simulate what happens during migration
    # is tricky and often not reliable, as Django's migration framework does
    # a lot more than just modify model in Python. It involves creating new 
    # database schema etc. Thus, directly changing model definitions in code
    # like below does not truly simulate the migration process.
    # For a more accurate reproduction, separate Django migration files would
    # normally be needed and applied using Django's manage.py commands.
    
    # This adjustment is intended to trigger the scenario, but please note
    # due to constraints of this setup, it might not fully reproduce the issue.
    
    # Update the ManyToManyField's target to 'self'
    Foo.bar.field.remote_field.model = 'self'
    Foo._meta.local_many_to_many = [Foo.bar]

    def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
        print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
        for frame in tb:
            line_number = frame.lineno
            code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
            print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
            print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    
    # Attempt to trigger the usage of the updated field, expecting an error
    foo_instance = Foo()
    foo_instance.save()  # Try to save an instance
    foo_instance.bar.all()  # Access the M2M relation
 
    print("Migration appeared to succeed without raising the expected exception.")
except utils.OperationalError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    assert "no such column" in str(e), "Issue not reproduced"
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    assert False, "Unexpected error type"
else:
    exit(0)  # If no exception, exit with success
```

Please note, directly changing a model's many-to-many field to point to `'self'` in the manner depicted above will not perfectly simulate the nuances of an actual migration process. Django migrations include operations that modify the database schema based on changes detected in model definitions. Here, the goal is to simulate an issue described, but real-world scenarios might necessitate actual migration files and operations.
