For 'Optional' types, translate 'Optional[X]' to 'X | None'. For 'Literal' types, translate 'Literal[\"X\"]' to '\"X\"'. Additionally, ensure 'Literal' values are displayed without the 'Literal' prefix and are highlighted using normal Python syntax highlighting. This might involve identifying 'Literal' usage within the AST parsing logic and transforming the associated nodes accordingly. These modifications should preserve existing functionality, ensuring that all other annotation types continue to be parsed and displayed as before. The changes to 'Union', 'Optional', and 'Literal' handling should only apply when a new configuration option is enabled."

        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new configuration option (e.g., 'simplified_type_annotations') that users can set in their project's 'conf.py' to enable or disable the simplified formatting of type annotations. The default behavior (with the option disabled) should preserve the current formatting of type annotations. Implement the logic to check this configuration option within '_parse_annotation' function (or relevant functions) and apply the new formatting rules accordingly. This ensures that the enhancements are opt-in, allowing users to upgrade Sphinx without forcing them to adopt the new annotation formatting immediately."
