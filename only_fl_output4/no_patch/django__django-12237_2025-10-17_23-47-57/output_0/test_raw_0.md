To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that replicates the described issue with the `slugify` function and the Turkish/Azerbaijani letter "İ", the following code can be utilized. This script checks if the `slugify` output for "İstanbul" is as expected, raises an `AssertionError` if not, and utilizes the provided function to print a stack trace clearly.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_slugify_issue():
    from django.utils.text import slugify

    title = "Hello İstanbul"
    expected_slug = "hello-istanbul"  # Assuming the correct behavior should produce this output
    
    # Attempt to create a slug with the problematic character
    slug = slugify(title, allow_unicode=True)

    # Check if the resulting slug matches the expected pattern
    assert slug == expected_slug, f"Slugify did not produce the expected output. Got: {slug}, Expected: {expected_slug}"
    
    print("Test passed - Issue not present or has been fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_slugify_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Ensure non-zero exit code for failure cases
```

Note: 
- The script assumes that you have Django installed in your Python environment, as it directly imports and uses Django's `slugify` function.
- The `expected_slug` is defined as `"hello-istanbul"`, which assumes that a correct `slugify` processing of "İstanbul" would ignore the Turkish specific character and treat it as a regular "i" following `lower()`. This expectation may need to be adjusted based on the intended behavior in handling Turkish/Azerbaijani characters.
- The script will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., if the `assert` condition is met and no exception is raised) or exit with code 1 and print a detailed stack trace if the issue is present.
