When running this script in a Django environment, it should raise an `AssertionError` if `HttpResponse` does not handle `memoryview` objects correctly, specifically if it fails to convert `memoryview` to its bytes representation and instead returns an unexpected object or bytes representation like `<memory at ...>`. 

Make sure your Django project is properly set up to execute this script, including having Django installed and properly configured in your environment. This script assumes that you have Django already set up in the project where it will be executed.
