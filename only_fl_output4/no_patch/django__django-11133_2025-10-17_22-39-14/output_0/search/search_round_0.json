When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n# String content\nresponse = HttpResponse(\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is correct\n# Bytes content\nresponse = HttpResponse(b\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is also correct\n# memoryview content\nresponse = HttpResponse(memoryview(b\"My Content\"))\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'\n# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'\n</issue>"

Given the issue description, it seems prudent to examine the HttpResponse class and the __init__ method or any method that sets or gets the content, as these would be the most likely places needing adjustment to handle memoryview objects properly.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")`: To find out which file(s) contain the HttpResponse class to target the problem area.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"HttpResponse\")`: To understand how the HttpResponse is initialized and see if the issue could be addressed here.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`: Since the issue involves setting and getting the `response.content`, investigating how the `content` property works could provide insights into where the logic needs to be adapted to handle memoryview objects."
