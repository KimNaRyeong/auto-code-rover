Understand how `plt.sca(ax)` is implemented to figure out why it is not working with axes created using subfigures.\n2. Look into how subfigures are implemented or how `fig.subfigures(2, 1)` creates subfigures might provide insight into why the axes from subfigures are causing an issue in `plt.sca()`.\n3. Since the error message points out an issue with treating a 'SubFigure' as an int, we need to check how figures are normally handled within `plt.figure()` and how axes are managed as well.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the API calls I am making:\n\n- `search_method(\"sca\")`: To get information about the `sca()` method implementation.\n- `search_class(\"SubFigure\")`: To gather details on the `SubFigure` class and understand its structure and relation to the issue.\n- `search_method(\"figure\")`: Because the error traceback mentioned an issue in `figure(ax.figure)`, getting more context on this could clarify the handling of figure instances."
