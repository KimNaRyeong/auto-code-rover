        "intended_behavior": "Update the `sca(ax)` method to properly handle `SubFigure` instances by recognizing when `ax.figure` is a `SubFigure` and correctly setting it as the current figure without raising a `TypeError`. This involves adjusting the internal logic to differentiate between `Figure` and `SubFigure` and ensuring that the functionality for setting the current axes and figure does not break when a `SubFigure` is involved. The modification must preserve the existing functionality for regular `Figure` objects while extending support for `SubFigure` instances."
