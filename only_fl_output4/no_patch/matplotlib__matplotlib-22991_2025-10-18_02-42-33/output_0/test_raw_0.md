This script checks if the specific issue with `plt.sca()` and subfigures is present. It raises an exception and prints a Stacktrace if the issue exists, fulfilling the requirement of reproducing the issue. On successfully reproducing the error, it fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the problem is still present. When the issue is fixed, the script should run without raising an `AssertionError` and exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue.
