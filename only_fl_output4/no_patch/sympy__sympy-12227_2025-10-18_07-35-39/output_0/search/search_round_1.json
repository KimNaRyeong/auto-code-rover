        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analyzing the Collected Context\n\n#### Float Class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Float` class represents floating-point numbers in SymPy with arbitrary precision. It includes methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions. The class uses an internal representation (`_mpf_`) and keeps track of its precision (`_prec`).\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  This class is directly related to the issue since the bug concerns the handling of precision within the `Float` constructor. The issue describes a need to distinguish between binary and decimal precision explicitly, which currently seems to be conflated.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  Ideally, the constructor should allow users to specify both binary (`prec`) and decimal (`dps`) precision explicitly, making it clear which type of precision is being set. Handling of both should be separate and clear, preventing ambiguity and ensuring that users can create `Float` objects that accurately represent their data.\n\n#### `__new__` Method in Float\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `__new__` method is the constructor for the `Float` class, handling the creation and initialization of `Float` instances. It processes the `num` (the value of the float) and `prec` (the precision) arguments to construct a floating-point number with a given precision. The method deals with various forms of `num`, converting them into a consistent internal format.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  This method is at the heart of the bug discussion. It currently interprets `prec` in a way that may be ambiguous \u2014 it is not clear whether it refers to decimal or binary precision without examining the implementation. The handling of the `prec` parameter, its conversion to `dps` (decimal places), and how these inform the internal precision reflect the core of the issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  After modifications, the `__new__` method should clearly distinguish between `dps` and `prec` inputs, allowing them to be specified separately and unambiguously by the user. If both are provided, the method should raise an error, as suggested in the issue, to prevent mixed signals about the intended precision. This change requires a careful approach to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible or to introduce deprecation warnings where necessary.\n\n#### Usage of `Float(` in Various Files\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  These snippets show how the `Float` class is instantiated throughout the codebase. The diverse usage patterns include setting precision, creating floats from strings, numbers, and other symbolic representations.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  How the `Float` constructor is called in these locations is crucial for evaluating the impact of changing its interface. It will help assess the breadth of changes needed across the codebase and identify where updates or migration efforts are necessary due to the constructor's modification.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The analysis of these usage patterns is essential for designing a migration path for existing code. It's important to understand common patterns to potentially offer automated ways to migrate to the new interface. Additionally, it informs how to update documentation and provide examples that clearly distinguish `dps` and `prec`, guiding users in the transition to the revised API.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe necessary adjustments to the `Float` class, particularly its constructor, are central to resolving the issue. Any changes must be made with a deep understanding of the current implementation and usages across the codebase to minimize disruption and maintain or improve clarity in numerical precision handling. Identifying and documenting these patterns will be crucial for a successful transition to the improved `Float` API."

It requires careful communication and documentation to ensure a smooth transition for users of the library."
