        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to understand the implementation and usage of the `Float` constructor across the codebase. Based on the issue description, it's clear that changes in the constructor could widely impact the code, especially in aspects related to precision handling (`_prec`, `dps`, and `prec` arguments). Here are the API calls I would invoke to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `Float` class to get an overview of its implementation including constructors and perhaps some insight into how precision is currently being handled.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Float\")\n   ```\n\n2. The issue specifically mentions the mishandling or confusion between binary precision (`prec`) and decimal precision (`dps`). It will be useful to find how the constructor of `Float` currently processes its arguments, especially the `prec` argument.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"Float.__new__\", \"Float\")\n   ```\n\n3. To understand how current invocations of the `Float` constructor across the codebase might be impacted by the proposed changes, I will search for code snippets where `Float` is being instantiated, especially where precision is explicitly specified.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"Float(\")\n   ```\n\nCross-referencing the `Float` class and its constructor implementation with usage examples in the codebase should provide a comprehensive understanding necessary for addressing the issue without introducing regressions."
