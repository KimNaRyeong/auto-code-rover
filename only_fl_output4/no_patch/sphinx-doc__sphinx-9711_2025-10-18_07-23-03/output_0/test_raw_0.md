This script tries to reproduce the reported issue by setting up the environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and attempting to build the Sphinx documentation. It raises an `AssertionError` if the environment setup fails to reveal the issue, implying that the problem might no longer exist or the setup was incorrect. Conversely, the script prints "The issue with Sphinx extension version checking was reproduced successfully" and exits with code 1 if the issue is successfully replicated, indicating the bug's presence as initially reported.
