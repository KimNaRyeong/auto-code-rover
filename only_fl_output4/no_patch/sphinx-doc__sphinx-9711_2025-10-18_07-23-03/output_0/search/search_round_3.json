This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Let's consider alternative approaches to locate where Sphinx handles extension version requirements and comparisons. Since the specific queries did not yield results, we should aim for broader terms and concepts related to the issue at hand.\n\n1. **Adjusting the search for `needs_extensions` method:** Since a direct method search for `needs_extensions` yielded no results, it's possible that the functionality related to checking extension versions doesn't reside in a method with that exact name. There might be a broader mechanism for handling extensions or their requirements.\n\n2. **Looking for Sphinx configuration handlers:** The issue involves Sphinx's initialization or setup process where it checks for extension versions. We should search for methods or code related to Sphinx configuration, setup, or bootstrapping, as these areas are likely to handle extension requirements.\n\n3. **General version comparison logic:** Our initial attempt to find a `compare_versions` method was unsuccessful. However, Sphinx must compare versions somehow, even if not through a method with that name. It might be helpful to search for version comparison logic embedded within methods related to extension handling.\n\nConsidering these adjustments, let's initiate a new set of API calls:\n- Search for code related to Sphinx's setup or initialization process that might interact with extensions.\n  `search_code(\"setup_extension\")`\n\n- Since the issue is with how versions are checked as strings, let's look for any code that explicitly mentions version checking in a broader sense.\n  `search_code(\"version\")`\n\n- Investigate the mechanism for registering or evaluating extensions, as this could lead us to the point where versions are compared.\n  `search_method(\"setup\")`\n  \n- Lastly, it might be useful to search for anything related to Sphinx's extension management to get closer to the source of the issue.\n  `search_code(\"extensions\")`\n\nThese adjusted searches aim to cast a wider net to capture the underlying mechanism that could be responsible for the described issue."

This includes bootstrapping operations or the evaluation of configuration settings, which might not be straightforwardly named `setup_extension`.\n\n2. **Search for Extension Handling Mechanisms**: Understanding that extension management is a core part of Sphinx, it is critical to find how it registers and validates extensions, which might provide clues on how versions are compared.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's make more targeted API calls based on Sphinx's typical architecture and naming conventions:\n\n1. Since the problem involves Sphinx extensions and version checking but our specific search terms did not yield results, let's search more broadly for how extensions might be set up or managed within the codebase. This could be captured in configuration or initialization routines, which are often part of the core Sphinx setup process or within scripts that bootstrap Sphinx projects:\n\n   - `search_code(\"setup_extension\")`\n   - `search_code(\"add_extension\")`\n\n2. The issue could also be tied to how Sphinx projects parse and enforce 'requirements' or dependencies, which in this case include extension versions. Looking for any reference to requirements or dependency checking could be helpful:\n\n   - `search_code(\"requirements\")`\n   - `search_code(\"dependency\")`\n\n3. Since our initial search for direct version comparison logic (`compare_versions`) returned no results, we should look for indirect references or utilities involved in parsing or comparing versions. Sphinx or the project might utilize a utility function or method for this purpose not named as directly as first thought:\n\n   - `search_code(\"parse_version\")`\n   - `search_code(\"version_compare\")`\n\nThrough these calls, we aim to uncover the mechanisms by which Sphinx extensions are registered, how their version requirements are specified and checked, and any utility functions or methods that facilitate version comparison. This should provide a clearer picture of where adjustments might be needed to address the issue at hand."

This includes core Sphinx functionalities (like the builders and domain setup) and extensions (`autodoc`, `autosummary`, etc.). The presence of `add_extension` within `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`, specifically adding Jinja2 extensions, showcases an interface for extending the functionalities of Sphinx's environment, possibly including version handling for these extensions.\n\n**Relation to Bug**:\nThe widespread usage of `setup_extension` suggests that somewhere in these interactions, there could be a flawed mechanism for version check comparisons as string comparisons rather than semantic version comparisons. However, no direct evidence of version comparison logic is presented within these snippets.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThe intended correction would involve ensuring that versions are compared semantically (according to version numbering conventions) rather than lexicographically (as strings). This change should happen wherever extension versions are checked against their requirements.\n\n### Analyzing `parse_version`:\nThe snippets related to `parse_version` from `utils/bump_version.py` deal with version parsing, specifically extracting major and minor version components from a version string. This utility might be part of a version handling system, though it appears to pertain to a utility for version bumping, not directly to Sphinx's runtime handling of extension versions.\n\n**Relation to Bug**:\nWhile `parse_version` shows that there's a mechanism to parse versions into numerical components, this is a utility function and not evidently connected to the runtime comparison of extension versions. However, it indicates the kind of parsing logic that might be correctly applied to extension version checking.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nIdeally, Sphinx or the project should employ or adapt a function similar to `parse_version` when evaluating if an extension's current version fulfills the required minimum version, ensuring numerical components of version strings are correctly interpreted and compared.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps:\nGiven the analysis, we do not have direct access to the buggy code where extension versions are incorrectly compared. The information points towards where Sphinx deals with extensions (setup and registration) and version handling (parsing), but the direct mechanism of version requirement checking\u2014leading to the described issue\u2014has not been pinpointed.\n\nTo move forward effectively, it's imperative to inspect the locations where `setup_extension` is used within Sphinx's core (`sphinx/application.py`, `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, etc.) to understand how extensions declare their version requirements and how those requirements are validated against the installed extension versions. Inspecting the actual implementation of these setups could reveal the flawed version comparison logic, guiding us to a precise bug location and the needed fix."
