This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9.

There might be a broader mechanism for handling extensions or their requirements.\n\n2. **Looking for Sphinx configuration handlers:** The issue involves Sphinx's initialization or setup process where it checks for extension versions. We should search for methods or code related to Sphinx configuration, setup, or bootstrapping, as these areas are likely to handle extension requirements.\n\n3. **General version comparison logic:** Our initial attempt to find a `compare_versions` method was unsuccessful. However, Sphinx must compare versions somehow, even if not through a method with that name.

Since the problem involves Sphinx extensions and version checking but our specific search terms did not yield results, let's search more broadly for how extensions might be set up or managed within the codebase.

This includes core Sphinx functionalities (like the builders and domain setup) and extensions (`autodoc`, `autosummary`, etc.). The presence of `add_extension` within `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`, specifically adding Jinja2 extensions, showcases an interface for extending the functionalities of Sphinx's environment, possibly including version handling for these extensions.\n\n**Relation to Bug**:\nThe widespread usage of `setup_extension` suggests that somewhere in these interactions, there could be a flawed mechanism for version check comparisons as string comparisons rather than semantic version comparisons. However, no direct evidence of version comparison logic is presented within these snippets.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThe intended correction would involve ensuring that versions are compared semantically (according to version numbering conventions) rather than lexicographically (as strings). This change should happen wherever extension versions are checked against their requirements.\n\n### Analyzing `parse_version`:\nThe snippets related to `parse_version` from `utils/bump_version.py` deal with version parsing, specifically extracting major and minor version components from a version string. This utility might be part of a version handling system, though it appears to pertain to a utility for version bumping, not directly to Sphinx's runtime handling of extension versions.\n\n**Relation to Bug**:\nWhile `parse_version` shows that there's a mechanism to parse versions into numerical components, this is a utility function and not evidently connected to the runtime comparison of extension versions. However, it indicates the kind of parsing logic that might be correctly applied to extension version checking.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nIdeally, Sphinx or the project should employ or adapt a function similar to `parse_version` when evaluating if an extension's current version fulfills the required minimum version, ensuring numerical components of version strings are correctly interpreted and compared.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps:\nGiven the analysis, we do not have direct access to the buggy code where extension versions are incorrectly compared. The information points towards where Sphinx deals with extensions (setup and registration) and version handling (parsing), but the direct mechanism of version requirement checking\u2014leading to the described issue\u2014has not been pinpointed.\n\nTo move forward effectively, it's imperative to inspect the locations where `setup_extension` is used within Sphinx's core (`sphinx/application.py`, `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, etc.) to understand how extensions declare their version requirements and how those requirements are validated against the installed extension versions. Inspecting the actual implementation of these setups could reveal the flawed version comparison logic, guiding us to a precise bug location and the needed fix."

Notably, without direct snippets showing version comparisons akin to the reported issue, analyzing these results requires consideration of where version handling is most relevant to the problem described.\n\n1. **Understanding the Role of `sphinx/application.py` in Version Handling**\n   - `sphinx/application.py` is a core part of the Sphinx framework, responsible for initializing and configuring the Sphinx application instance. This includes setting up extensions, managing configuration values, and handling events and build processes.\n\n2. **Relevance to the Bug**\n   - The method `require_sphinx` is particularly interesting because it suggests a mechanism for requiring a specific Sphinx version, which likely involves comparing version strings to enforce minimum requirements. This is directly related to the bug, as the issue involves improper comparison of extension version strings.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - Ideally, the comparison logic used within the Sphinx application, especially in methods like `require_sphinx`, should accurately compare semantic versions, ensuring that '0.10' is recognized as greater than '0.6'. This would likely involve parsing version strings into numerically comparable components or utilizing a version comparison library that understands semantic versioning.\n\n#### Specific Analysis on `require_sphinx`\nGiven the results and assuming `require_sphinx` as a potential candidate for containing relevant logic:\n- **What does it do?** This method likely checks if the current Sphinx version meets the minimum required version for an operation or extension to proceed.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue with extension version checking could share a similar underlying faulty comparison mechanism as seen with Sphinx version requirements\u2014i.e., treating version numbers as strings rather than semantically.\n- **Intended behavior:** The method should ensure that version comparisons are conducted in a manner that adheres to semantic versioning rules, correctly identifying whether the current Sphinx version satisfies required version criteria.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\nWhile we have not pinpointed the exact faulty comparison logic from the given context, the following actions are recommended based on our analysis:\n- **Inspect `require_sphinx` Method:** Given its direct involvement with version requirements, review and, if necessary, refactor its implementation to leverage correct semantic version comparison.\n- **General Refactor for Version Comparisons:** For methods in `sphinx/application.py` and potentially elsewhere that handle version strings, incorporate or ensure the use of a semantic versioning comparison approach, preventing issues like the reported bug.\n\nFurther action might involve either utilizing Python's built-in version parsing and comparison capabilities (e.g., `pkg_resources.parse_version`) or a dedicated semantic versioning library for accurately evaluating version strings beyond the current string comparison method."

        "content": "Based on the provided search results and analysis, we've identified a potential area of interest but lack sufficient detailed context to pinpoint exact bug locations related to the issue of improper version comparison in Sphinx extension handling. However, given our theoretical understanding and analysis, the intended behavior and necessary fixes can be speculated as follows:\n\n### Intended Behavior and Bug Locations\n\nAlthough the precise code snippets and methods directly responsible for the described issue were not identified in the search results, we can infer the necessary corrections based on general practices for handling version comparisons in software applications:\n\n1. **Buggy Location**: While we didn't isolate a specific method within `sphinx/application.py` or related files that exhibit the flawed version comparison logic, any method responsible for evaluating if an installed extension's version satisfies the minimum required version is a candidate. Common places to look include methods that register, initialize, or check extensions during the Sphinx build process.\n\n2. **Intended Behavior**: \n    - **Accurate Semantic Version Comparison**: The code responsible for comparing extension versions should treat versions semantically, ensuring that version '0.10.0' is considered greater than '0.6.0', for instance. This involves parsing version strings into numerically comparable parts or using an existing library designed for semantic version comparison.\n    - **Extending or Refactoring Version Checking Logic**: If the current logic uses simple string comparison, this should be replaced or extended to use semantic versioning principles. Python's `pkg_resources.parse_version` or similar functionality from the `packaging` library could be employed here.\n    - **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Any modifications should preserve the ability of Sphinx to enforce version requirements for its extensions while improving the accuracy of these checks. This means that any fix should be backward compatible, not affecting extensions whose versions are already correctly identified under the current system.\n\nGiven the lack of exact locations, further investigation within `sphinx/application.py` or by consulting Sphinx's extension handling documentation and source code would be required to implement a precise fix.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout direct evidence from the search results, recommending specific code modifications is speculative. However, focusing on enhancing the semantic version comparison where extension versions are checked against their requirements in Sphinx's setup or initialization process would address the issue stated. Implementing these fixes requires a careful review of the Sphinx documentation and possibly contributing guidelines for a successful patch."
