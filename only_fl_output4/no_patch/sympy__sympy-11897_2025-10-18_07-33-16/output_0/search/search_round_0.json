        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the LaTeX and pretty printers in the codebase, and how expressions are transformed for these outputs. The issue mentions inconsistency in the output of LaTeX vs. pretty printer representations, specifically with examples `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. \n\nFirstly, we should identify the classes or methods responsible for generating LaTeX and pretty printer outputs. Then, analyze how they handle expressions, especially the ones mentioned. We know that the `latex` function and some form of pretty print function (`pprint`) are involved. Let's initiate the search to find these relevant portions of the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the method responsible for converting expressions to LaTeX format.\n2. Search for the method or class responsible for pretty printing expressions.\n3. Search for the code snippets where the sample expressions from the issue are being handled or could potentially be handled.\n\nThese actions require specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"latex\")`: To find the method responsible for generating LaTeX representations of expressions.\n- `search_method(\"pprint\")`: To find the method or class responsible for pretty printing, though it's possible that \"pprint\" is a convenience function and we're looking for something more intrinsic to the pretty printing process.\n- `search_code(\"exp(-x)*log(x)\")`: This will help us understand how the specific example given in the issue is processed for output.\n- `search_code(\"1/(x + y)/2\")`: This will help us find how the code handles this expression for LaTeX and pretty printing, identifying any special handling or inconsistencies.\n\nThe aim is to understand the underlying implementation for these functionalities, which will then guide us in identifying why the inconsistencies occur and what might be done to align the outputs more closely, adhering to the principle that LaTeX output should match pretty print output unless LaTeX can provide better representation."
