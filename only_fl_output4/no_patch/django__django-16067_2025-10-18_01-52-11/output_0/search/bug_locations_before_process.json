        "method": "__call__",
        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to correctly handle and validate decimal numbers represented in scientific notation, like '0E+1'. Given that '0E+1' equates to a numerical value of 0 with scaling, the validator should treat it the same as it would '0.0' after normalizing the input. The mechanics of this should involve adjusting the validation logic to consider the normalized form of decimal inputs, thereby ensuring that inputs in scientific notation are appropriately validated against the `max_digits` and `decimal_places` constraints without raising an unnecessary `ValidationError`. This update ensures that values in scientific notation, which are valid within the declared field constraints, are accepted and processed correctly, preserving the functionality of validating decimal inputs while extending it to consistently handle scientific notation."
