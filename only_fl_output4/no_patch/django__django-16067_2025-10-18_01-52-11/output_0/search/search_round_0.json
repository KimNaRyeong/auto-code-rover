        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to gather context about several key components mentioned in the issue description. Since the issue revolves around the `DecimalValidator` class and its behavior when handling scientific notation, particularly '0E+1', we should focus on locating this class, identifying the method that performs the validation, and understanding any changes in behavior between Django versions as stated. Additionally, examining the commit that introduced the behavior change could provide insights into the reasoning behind it and potential ways to address it.\n\nHere are the API calls to perform:\n\n1. Search for the DecimalValidator class to understand its structure and find relevant methods that might be involved in the issue.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DecimalValidator\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the method `clean` of the `DecimalField` class is mentioned as raising the `ValidationError`, it's critical to find where `clean` is defined within the context of `DecimalField`.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DecimalField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Understanding the usage of `Decimal` within the context of the validation process could be crucial, especially since calling `normalize()` on a Decimal instance was mentioned as a workaround. It's necessary to find where `Decimal` is instantiated or manipulated within the `DecimalValidator` or `DecimalField` methods.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"Decimal(\")\n   ```\n\n4. The specific commit mentioned (`7c6590af5f199c9ede970758877b5c1eb7e9b3a6`) suggests a significant change related to this issue. Although it might not be directly accessible through these search APIs, understanding the context of methods or validation logic altered in this commit may require inspecting nearby code or logic introduced around the same time. We will look for any reference to this commit or related validation logic changes.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"7c6590af5f199c9ede970758877b5c1eb7e9b3a6\")\n   ```\n\nThrough these API calls, we aim to gather sufficient information to understand the flow of data within the `DecimalValidator` and `DecimalField` clean method, how they interact with the `Decimal` objects, and any relevant changes introduced in the commit mentioned that could have affected behavior in Django 2.0. This context will be essential for devising a fix."
