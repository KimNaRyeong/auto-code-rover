        "content": "To address the issue raised regarding the resolution of `output_field` when combining numeric expressions with MOD operator in Django, specifically when dealing with mixed types like Decimal and Integer, we'll need to gather more context about how Django's ORM handles expressions, especially numeric ones, and the use of the MOD operator. Key areas to explore include the implementation of the MOD operator (`%`) in Django expressions and how the ORM handles type coercion or resolution for `output_field` in expressions involving different numeric types. \n\nGiven this, we should focus on classes and methods in Django's ORM that deal with expressions, particularly those that handle arithmetic operations and type resolution. The `Expression` class and its subclasses, as well as utility functions or methods that determine the `output_field`, would be of specific interest.\n\nLet's make the following API calls for gathering sufficient context:\n\n1. To understand how Django defines and represents expressions, especially those involving operations like MOD, we should look into the relevant classes and methods. Since arithmetic expressions are likely modeled in specific classes:\n\n   - `search_class(\"Expression\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Func\")` - Django uses the `Func` class for database functions, which might include the MOD operator.\n\n2. To specifically address the handling of the MOD operation, and considering it might be encapsulated in a method or a specialised class representing database functions or expressions:\n\n   - `search_method(\"MOD\")`\n\n3. Given the issue description mentions a problem with type resolution between Decimal and Integer types, we should also look for where Django handles type coercion or determines the `output_field` for expressions:\n\n   - `search_method(\"resolve_expression\")`\n   - `search_method(\"as_sql\")` - This method may provide insights into how expressions are translated to SQL and how types are handled in this translation, potentially impacting `output_field` resolution.\n\nThese API calls aim to pinpoint the area in Django's ORM where arithmetic expressions are handled, and specifically where the type resolution policy is applied, which seems to not behave as expected when the MOD operator is used with mixed numeric types."
