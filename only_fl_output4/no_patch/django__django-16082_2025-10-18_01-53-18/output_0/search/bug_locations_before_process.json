        "intended_behavior": "In the `resolve_expression` method, the intended behavior should include enhanced logic to accurately determine and resolve the `output_field` for expressions involving the MOD operator with mixed numeric types (e.g., Decimal and Integer). This logic should ensure the `output_field` is correctly resolved to a Decimal when appropriate, respecting the need for precision in numeric operations. The `as_sql` method should ensure that this resolution translates correctly into the SQL statement, preserving the decided `output_field` type. This might involve additional checks or logic specifically for handling cases where the MOD operator is used, ensuring the SQL output is not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with Django's ORM type expectations."
