        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context around the parts of the code mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we are interested in understanding how the `__eq__` method in `Symbol` objects is implemented, how `sympify` and `parse_expr` are defined, and the implementation details of `eval_expr`. We also need insight into how `parse_expr` is being invoked with the specific parameters related to the failure. Thus, the following API calls will be required:\n\n1. To explore how `Symbol` objects handle equality comparisons, inspect the `__eq__` method within the `Symbol` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class('__eq__', 'Symbol')`\n\n2. The issue mentions a call to `sympify` that eventually leads to the erroneous behavior. It's crucial to understand its implementation:\n   - `search_method('sympify')`\n\n3. Since `parse_expr` plays a critical role in evaluating the expression that leads to the error, investigating its workings is necessary:\n   - `search_method('parse_expr')`\n\n4. The `eval_expr` function is directly involved in the exception. Understanding its implementation will provide insights into how expressions are evaluated and why it might attempt to access non-existing attributes:\n   - `search_method('eval_expr')`\n\n5. Additionally, given that the error occurs within a specific context involving `sympify` and `parse_expr`, getting a broader view of their interactions could be valuable. Locating the `parse_expr` invocation within the file where `sympify` is defined could reveal how they are typically used together:\n   - This requires knowing the file where `sympify` is defined, which isn't provided directly in the issue description. Assuming `sympify` is in `sympify.py`, we would search for `parse_expr` usage in that file. However, since we need to verify the file path first, let's find where `sympify` is to correctly target our search:\n     - `search_method('sympify')` (Note: This is repeated intentionally to justify finding the file for the next step based on its definition's location, which will inform where to search for `parse_expr` usage context.)\n\nThese API calls are the initial steps required to understand the problem and its context within the codebase. The results from these calls will guide further investigation and potential fixes."
