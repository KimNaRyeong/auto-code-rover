        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals information essential for resolving the issue described in the initial bug report. Let\u2019s delve into each part of the code and its relevance to the issue:\n\n### `astropy/units/equivalencies.py` - `thermodynamic_temperature` Function\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `thermodynamic_temperature` function defines a conversion between Jy/beam and \"thermodynamic temperature\", `T_CMB`, in Kelvins. This conversion is commonly used in cosmology. The default value of `T_cmb` is set to `Planck15.Tcmb0` if not provided.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - The issue raises a concern about consistency in using default cosmologies across equivalencies. Specifically, this function defaults to using the Planck 2015 (`Planck15.Tcmb0`) cosmology for `T_cmb` when not provided, illustrating part of the inconsistent behavior observed.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - To address consistency, the intended behavior might involve modifying this function to use the default cosmology (possibly changing to Planck 2015 according to the issue description) instead of directly referencing `Planck15`.\n\n### `astropy/units/equivalencies.py` - `with_H0` Function\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `with_H0` function allows for conversion between quantities with \"little-h\" and physical units, assuming a value for the Hubble constant (`H0`). If `H0` is `None`, it uses the default cosmology's `H0` value.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - This function demonstrates the second part of the described inconsistency by using the default cosmology's `H0` (currently `WMAP9`) if `H0` is not provided, contrasting with the `thermodynamic_temperature` function's approach.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Consistency would require this function also to base its default on the same underlying cosmology as `thermodynamic_temperature`, especially if the project aims to standardize the default cosmology across different equivalencies.\n\n### `astropy/cosmology` - Default Cosmology Usage\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippets from `distances.py` and `equivalencies.py` show uses of `default_cosmology.get()`. It retrieves the current default cosmology from the cosmology module to use its parameters (like `H0`) when not explicitly provided by the user. \n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - Usage of `default_cosmology.get().H0` in `with_H0` and direct referencing to `Planck15.Tcmb0` in `thermodynamic_temperature` highlight the inconsistency in how default cosmologies are utilized in different contexts within the same codebase.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - To ensure consistency, either both should use `default_cosmology.get()` for their defaults (and ensure `default_cosmology` is appropriately set to Planck 2015 if that's the decided standard), or there should be a project-wide reassessment of how default cosmologies are determined and applied.\n\n### Considering the `Planck15` Class Not Found\n- The search for the `Planck15` class returned no result. This might suggest it\u2019s imported from an external module or that it\u2019s defined in a way the search API did not catch. To resolve the issue accurately, understanding precisely how `Planck15` is included and utilized within `astropy` is crucial. Since a direct search for the class was unsuccessful, alternatives might include searching for how `..cosmology` module imports and defines its objects or revisiting import paths utilized across `astropy`.\n\nGiven the issue and the inconsistency in default cosmologies used across different equivalencies, potential steps towards a resolution might involve:\n- Ensuring both `thermodynamic_temperature` and `with_H0` equivalencies leverage the same, project-wide standard for default cosmology, possibly via `default_cosmology.get()`.\n- If shifting to Planck 2015 as the project-wide default, confirming all relevant parts of the codebase adhere to this standard and updating `default_cosmology.get()`'s default accordingly.\n- Investigating the direct usage and import paths of cosmologies like `Planck15` to ensure they align with the project's standards and practices for modularity and maintainability."

This modification would ensure that both equivalencies are using the current default cosmology from the same source, preserving existing functionality while making the choice of default cosmology consistent across the library.\n\n   Bug Location 2:\n   - **File:** `astropy/units/equivalencies.py`\n   - **Function:** `with_H0`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Although this method is already using `default_cosmology.get()` to source the default value of `H0`, ensuring that the mentioned change to the `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency does not conflict with its operation is crucial. The intended behavior here remains unchanged but warrants a review to ensure consistency is upheld following any changes in how the default cosmology is determined or if the default cosmology itself changes (e.g., from WMAP9 to Planck 2015).\n\nThese modifications aim to achieve a consistent approach in utilizing the default cosmology values across equivalencies, adhering to the project's standards and ensuring that future updates to the default cosmology reflect uniformly across different parts of the project."
