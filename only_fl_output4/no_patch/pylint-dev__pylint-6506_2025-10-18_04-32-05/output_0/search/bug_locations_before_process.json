        "intended_behavior": "After identifying unrecognized options and raising `_UnrecognizedOptionError`, the program should handle the exception to provide a helpful message to the user about the unrecognized option(s). Instead of allowing a traceback to be printed, the error handling should catch this exception, print a user-friendly error message that clarifies the error, suggest checking the help (`--help`) for valid options, and then exit gracefully with an appropriate non-zero exit code. This behavior should be achieved without negating any existing functionality, specifically maintaining the processing of both configuration file and command line arguments, including the initialization hooks and plugin loading."
