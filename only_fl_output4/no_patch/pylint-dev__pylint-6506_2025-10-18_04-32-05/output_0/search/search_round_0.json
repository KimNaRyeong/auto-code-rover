        "content": "To address the issue reported, we need to understand how Pylint processes command line options and handles unrecognized options to ensure we can modify the behavior to catch the unrecognized option error and display a more user-friendly message instead of a traceback. The reported issue gives us a few key pieces of information and code locations:\n1. The issue occurs in \"pylint/lint/run.py\" and \"pylint/config/config_initialization.py\".\n2. A specific exception `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is raised.\n3. The message indicates involvement of a command line option processing mechanism.\n\nBased on this information, here's the strategy for gathering the necessary code context:\n- Check how options are processed in `pylint/lint/run.py`.\n- Look into `_config_initialization` function in \"config_initialization.py\" for where it raises `_UnrecognizedOptionError`.\n\nHere are the corresponding search API calls:\n\n1. ```python\nsearch_method_in_file('_config_initialization', 'pylint/config/config_initialization.py')\n```\n2. ```python\nsearch_class('_UnrecognizedOptionError', 'pylint/config/exceptions.py')\n```"
