To address the issue of running `pylint` with an unrecognized option and observing unintended traceback as described, let's create a Python script that automates the reproduction of this behavior. The script will attempt to invoke `pylint` with an invalid option `-Q`, expect to encounter an error, and then check whether the output matches the expected error message without showing a Python traceback. Here's how you can do this:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pylint_with_unrecognized_option():
    cmd = ['pylint', '-Q']
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stderr
        if "unrecognized-option" in output and "Traceback" not in output:
            print("The issue appears to be resolved. No unexpected stack trace found.")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Unexpected traceback found when running pylint with an unrecognized option.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while running pylint:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pylint_with_unrecognized_option()
```

This script follows the steps:

1. Runs `pylint` with an unrecognized option `-Q` using `subprocess.run`.
2. Captures and checks the standard error output for the presence of an "unrecognized-option" message.
3. Verifies that a Python traceback is not part of the output to confirm that the handled exception does not leak unnecessary details to the user.
4. Uses the `print_stacktrace` function to neatly print any caught exceptions, aiding in debugging if the script does not execute as expected.

Before running this script as `python3 reproducer.py`, ensure the following:

- You have `pylint` installed in your current Python environment. If not, install it using `pip install pylint`.
- Your Python environment (where `pylint` is installed) is active if using virtual environments.
- Adjust the `cmd` variable if your `pylint` executable is not available in the system's PATH or named differently. 

This script will exit with code 0 if it successfully identifies that the expected error handling behavior (no traceback for unrecognized options) is present, and exit with code 1 if not, indicating the presence of the issue.
