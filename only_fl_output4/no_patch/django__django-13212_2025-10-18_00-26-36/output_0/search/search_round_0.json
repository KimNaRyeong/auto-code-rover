For example:\n\u201cblah\u201d is not a valid email.\nBy making built-in validators provide value to ValidationError, one can override an error message and use a %(value)s placeholder.\nThis placeholder value matches an example already in the docs:\n\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/#writing-validators\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context about how validation errors are raised and how validators are implemented in this Django project. Since the request specifically mentions built-in validators and the ability to override error messages with a %(value)s placeholder, we should focus on the core validation mechanics.\n\nFirst, let's identify where built-in validators are implemented. Django's validators are likely to be defined either in a common validators module or within specific field types. Let's initiate searches to find these validators and a common method or class that raises `ValidationError`.\n\n1. `search_class(\"ValidationError\")`: To find the definition of the `ValidationError` class, understanding its implementation will help us in modifying it to include the provided value.\n\n2. `search_method(\"validate_email\")`: As an example of a built-in validator, this method should give us an idea of how validators are currently implemented and how they raise errors.\n\n3. `search_code(\"validators=[\")`: This will help us find examples of how validators are attached to model fields or forms and could provide context on where we can integrate the value inclusion feature.\n\nThese searches are aimed to cover the groundwork needed for understanding both the implementation and usage of validators in the project, making it easier to devise a solution that fits within the existing architecture."
