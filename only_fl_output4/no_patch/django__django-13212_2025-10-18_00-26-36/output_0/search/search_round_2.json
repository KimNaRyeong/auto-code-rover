        "content": "Analyzing the collected context related to the issue of including the provided value in the `ValidationError` message, let's consider the results:\n\n### 1. ValidationError Class\n\nThe `ValidationError` class, found in `django/core/exceptions.py`, serves as the base class for all validation errors thrown within Django. \n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This class encapsulates validation error information, including the message, an optional error code, and optional parameters for further detailing the error. It provides methods to access error messages and update error dictionaries.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** This class is directly related to the issue since it's responsible for handling error messages during validation. However, it seems it doesn't currently support including the failing value directly in the error message, based on its constructor signature.\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended modification would require the `ValidationError` class to somehow support including the provided (failing) value in its message, presumably by accepting it as part of its `__init__` method or offering a way to interpolate it into the final message string.\n\n### 2. validate_email Method\n\nThe attempt to find a `validate_email` method did not return any results. This might indicate that specific validators are either not named as anticipated or are implemented within a more generic validation framework or method that wasn't directly matched by the query.\n\n- **What other API calls can be made:** Since `validate_email` wasn't found directly, it might be useful to look for a more generic validator or a file that contains validators, such as searching for files with `validators` in their name or path. For example, `search_method_in_file(\"validate\", \"django/core/validators.py\")` (assuming validators are located in such a file based on Django's usual structure), or searching broadly for any validators with `search_code(\"def validate\")`.\n\n### 3. Validators in Code Snippets\n\nThe code snippets found containing `validators=[` give insight into how validators are used within model and migration files throughout Django. These snippets point to definitions where validators are applied to model fields.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** These snippets show various instances where validators are defined and attached to model fields, indicating a pattern of usage for field validation in Django.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The relationship here is indirect, showing where and how validators are applied but not the implementation of the validators themselves. However, understanding this can help in determining how validators should behave or be modified to support including validation values in their error messages.\n- **Intended behavior:** While these snippets don't directly implement validation logic, changing validators to support including the failed value in error messages would mean that wherever a validator is assigned, it would be capable of utilizing this new feature. It implies modifying or extending the validators to accept and relay the provided value to the `ValidationError`.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems necessary to further investigate where and how validators are implemented within Django's codebase, specifically looking for their definitions and how they raise `ValidationError`s, to modify them according to the issue's requirement."

Here are the constructed API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"class BaseValidator\")`: This search is aimed at finding base validator definitions, assuming that built-in validators might inherit from a common base, which would be an ideal place to modify the behavior globally.\n- `search_code(\"raise ValidationError\")`: To understand how `ValidationError` is currently being raised across the project, which may pinpoint specific validators or a pattern of validation that could be enhanced to include the provided value in error messages.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\nGiven the initial analysis, the specific locations of the bugs cannot be precisely determined without additional context. However, based on the descriptions and the typical structure of Django projects, we can hypothesize the necessary modifications would likely occur in the following areas:\n\n- **File:** `django/core/exceptions.py`, **Class:** `ValidationError`: The `ValidationError` class might need to be enhanced to accept the failing value as an argument and format the error message accordingly. This would preserve its original functionality while adding the ability to include the provided value in error messages.\n\n- **Validators Implementation Files**: While specific files and classes have not been identified due to the lack of direct search results for validators like `validate_email`, the intended behavior across all validators would be to adapt their error-raising logic to include the provided value when constructing `ValidationError` objects. This could mean modifying individual validator functions or methods to accept and pass the value being validated to `ValidationError` when an invalid case is encountered.\n\n    - **Intended Behavior for Validators:** Modify validators to capture the value being validated and ensure it is passed to the `ValidationError` in a way that the error message can optionally include it. This means either modifying the validator's signature to include and pass this value or using a context that is already passed to validators that could include this information.\n\nWithout knowing the exact structure and implementation details of the current validators, these are high-level suggestions intended to guide toward the resolution of the issue. After gathering more context with the proposed search API calls, more precise modifications could be outlined."

BaseValidator in `django/core/validators.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The `BaseValidator` class serves as a foundational component for various validators across Django, providing a consistent structure for defining validation logic, including a default error message format and a validation code.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:** The `BaseValidator` class is directly related to the issue because it outlines the structure of error messages for validators inheriting from it. The default message includes a placeholder for `limit_value` and shows the actual value (`show_value`) that failed validation. This mechanism can be expanded or adapted to ensure that the `ValidationError` raised by these validators can include the specific value that triggered the validation error, consistent with the issue's aim.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** To resolve the issue, the `BaseValidator` class could be modified to more dynamically include the provided value in error messages. This could involve ensuring that all validators inheriting from `BaseValidator` have a standardized way of passing the validated value to the `ValidationError` message, perhaps by enhancing the message template or by processing the message in a method that formats it before raising `ValidationError`.\n\n#### 2. Instances of `raise ValidationError`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** These instances across various files in the Django codebase show where and how a `ValidationError` is raised. This includes forms, models, and several other components that validate user input or data.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:** Each of these instances represents a point in the code where the current validation logic decides that input data is invalid and raises an exception to that effect. However, not all these instances necessarily include the data causing the error in the error message, which is the heart of the issue being addressed.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior would involve ensuring that whenever `ValidationError` is raised because of a validation failure, it dynamically includes the failing value in the error message where appropriate and feasible. This may require modifying these instances to include an additional parameter when raising `ValidationError` or altering how the error message is formatted to include the failing data.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe analysis reveals two primary paths toward addressing the issue:\n1. **Modify `BaseValidator`**: Ensure this class supports including the provided value in error messages in a generalizable way that validators inheriting from it can leverage.\n2. **Refine Instances of `raise ValidationError`**: Where relevant and appropriate, ensure these instances are adapted to include the failing value in the error message, possibly by enhancing the context or formatting logic around these exceptions.\n\nGiven the widespread impact of these changes across Django's validation framework, careful consideration will be required to prevent breaking existing functionalities or introducing inconsistent validation messaging."

Adapt the error messaging mechanism to interpolate this value into the `ValidationError` message more explicitly. This could involve enhancing the existing message template or adjusting how the validator formats its error message before raising `ValidationError`. Ensure that these changes allow for backward compatibility and do not disrupt the current functionality for validators that do not require showing the validated value in their error message.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **General Location across Various Files:** Any file that includes instances of `raise ValidationError` where validators specifically should include the failing value in the error message.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** For each specific instance where it makes sense to include the validated (failing) value in the error message (and where such inclusion does not pose a security or privacy risk), modify the `raise ValidationError` invocation to ensure that the failing value is included in the error message. This may require wrapping the `raise` statement in a function that formats the message to include the value or directly modifying the message passed to `ValidationError` to include the value dynamically.\n\nNote: As the modification spans potentially numerous files and specific validators, a thorough review process would be essential to identify all relevant instances. Each modification should carefully consider the context to ensure clarity, accuracy, and security of error messages (e.g., avoiding inclusion of sensitive data). The goal should be to enhance debugging and user feedback without compromising existing validator functionality or message clarity."
