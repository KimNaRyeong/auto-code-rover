Adapt the error messaging mechanism to interpolate this value into the ValidationError message more explicitly. This could involve enhancing the existing message template or adjusting how the validator formats its error message before raising ValidationError. Ensure that these changes allow for backward compatibility and do not disrupt the current functionality for validators that do not require showing the validated value in their error message."

This may require wrapping the raise statement in a function that formats the message to include the value or directly modifying the message passed to ValidationError to include the value dynamically."
