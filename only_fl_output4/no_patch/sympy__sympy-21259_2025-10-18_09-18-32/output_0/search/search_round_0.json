        "content": "To effectively address the issue mentioned, we need to gather more context around how `Range` objects handle the `as_relational` method and identify where the logic must be updated or corrected. First, we can locate the `Range` class and the `as_relational` method within the codebase. Following that, it would be beneficial to inspect the code implementation or any related conditional logic that pertains to the handling of step values and modulus operations for `Range` objects.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Find the `Range` Class**: We need to locate the `Range` class within the codebase to understand its structure and methods. \n```python\nsearch_class(\"Range\")\n```\n\n2. **Find the `as_relational` Method in the `Range` Class**: After locating the `Range` class, we need to find the `as_relational` method within it. This method is key to resolving the issue as it seems to be where the logic for generating relational expressions from `Range` objects is implemented.\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"as_relational\", \"Range\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for Code Implementing the Incorrect Logic**: Since the issue description contains specific Python code snippets indicating the incorrect and correct logic, we can search the codebase for similar patterns to pinpoint where the corrections are needed. This can help in identifying if the incorrect logic is hardcoded somewhere or if it's a result of a more complex dynamic evaluation.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"(x >= 3) & (x <= 9) & Eq(x, floor(x))\")\n```\n\nThese calls should give us a good starting point to understand how `Range` objects are currently handled in the project and where we might need to insert or modify logic to include the `Eq(Mod(x, 2), 1)` condition, as mentioned in the issue."
