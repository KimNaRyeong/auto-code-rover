Given the issue at hand and the requirements provided, here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that explicitly checks for the presence of unit information in the group keys, structured to adequately reproduce the issue as described:

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u

    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2., ] * u.m})
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')

    for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
        # Extracting the length column, expecting it to be a Quantity
        length_col = cols['length']

        # The issue describes the absence of unit information in group keys
        # Hence, we first check for the unit and value in the key
        if not hasattr(length_col, 'unit') or not hasattr(length_col, 'value'):
            raise AssertionError("Group key is missing either the unit or the value attribute")

        # Now checking if the unit is indeed a meter
        assert length_col.unit == u.m, "Group key does not have the correct unit"

        # Checking if the value is preserved correctly in the grouped keys
        assert length_col.value in [1., 2., 3.], "Group key does not have the correct value"

        # If any of the above assertions fail, an AssertionError is raised
        print(f"Group key checked and passed: {length_col}")

    print("No issues detected. Group keys contain proper unit and value.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except Exception as e: # Catching any exception, not only AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1) # Exit with code 1 indicating failure to reproduce without exceptions
    exit(0) # Exit with code 0 indicating successful reproduction or lack of issue presence
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace if the group keys lack unit information or if the unit/type of the grouped keys does not match the expected. It has been tailored to identify the specific unit-related discrepancy mentioned in your issue description, ensuring it tests for the exact problem without deviating into potential unrelated side effects.
