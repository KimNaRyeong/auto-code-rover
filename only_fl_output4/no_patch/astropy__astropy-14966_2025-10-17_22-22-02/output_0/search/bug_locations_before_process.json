This may involve changes to how the grouping keys are generated, such that they include both the value and the unit of quantities. This change must ensure that for non-quantity columns, the existing functionality remains unchanged, maintaining backward compatibility and preserving the method's current behavior for all other data types."

To resolve the issue, this function needs to identify columns with quantity data and treat them such that their units are preserved in the group keys. This may require a mechanism to explicitly check and retain units when forming group keys from quantity columns."
