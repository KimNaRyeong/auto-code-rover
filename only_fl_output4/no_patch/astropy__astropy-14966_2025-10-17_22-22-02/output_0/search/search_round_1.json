Specifically, we need to understand how group keys are constructed and ensure they retain their quantity (i.e., value with units) instead of being reduced to mere floats. Relevant parts of the codebase would include the `QTable` class itself, any method responsible for grouping operations, and potentially, methods that handle extraction or representation of group keys. \n\nLet's proceed by searching for the relevant classes and methods:\n\n1. Search for the `QTable` class to understand its structure and related methods for grouping.\n2. Locate the method involved in grouping within the `QTable` class, which might be directly implemented or inherited from its parent classes.\n3. Investigate how keys are determined or extracted during the grouping process.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"QTable\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"group_by\", \"QTable\")\nsearch_method(\"group_keys\")\n```"

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, we've learned that:\n\n1. The `QTable` class is defined within `astropy/table/table.py`, but only a snippet of its definition is shown without detailed methods related to our concern, notably the absence of a direct `group_by` method implementation within the `QTable` class itself. This suggests that the `group_by` functionality is likely inherited from a parent class, possibly `Table`, without overrides or specific implementations for `QTable`.\n\n2. The search for a `group_by` method within `QTable` returned no results, indicating that `group_by` might be implemented in its superclass. This aligns with the common object-oriented programming practice where subclasses inherit methods from their parent classes unless explicitly overridden.\n\n3. The method `group_keys` could not be found in the codebase, which implies that the process of generating group keys during grouping operations might be abstracted differently or the method name assumed in the search does not exactly match the actual implementation.\n\nGiven the above points and considering the reported issue, it is crucial to explore a bit more about:\n\n- The implementation of the `group_by` method, likely in the `Table` class, to understand how it operates on `QTable` instances, especially how it deals with columns containing quantities.\n- How the grouping keys are generated and managed, especially since the issue points towards the group keys not retaining the unit information from quantity columns.\n\nTo dive deeper into these aspects, our next steps with API calls should aim to:\n\n1. Investigate the parent class `Table` where the `group_by` method might be implemented.\n2. Try understanding how Astropy's tables handle quantities in general, to see if there's a mechanism that is potentially bypassed or mishandled during grouping operations.\n\nLet's adjust our search to get the required information:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Table\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"group_by\", \"Table\")\nsearch_code(\"group_by\")\n```"
