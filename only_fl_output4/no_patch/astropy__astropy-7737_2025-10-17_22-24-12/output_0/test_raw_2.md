Given the feedback and the specifications provided for a new version of `reproducer.py`, here's how you can write the script. This version checks explicitly for the existence of `numpy` and `astropy.stats.biweight_location` before attempting to execute the test code. This should avoid the `ModuleNotFoundError` for a more straightforward reproducibility process.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_constant_array():
    try:
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError:
        raise ImportError('numpy module not found. Install it by running `pip install numpy`.')
    try:
        from astropy.stats import biweight_location
    except ImportError:
        raise ImportError('astropy module not found. Install it by running `pip install astropy`.')
    
    try:
        constant_array = np.ones(4)
        result = biweight_location(constant_array)
        assert result == 1.0, f"Expected biweight_location to return 1 but got {result}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_biweight_location_constant_array()
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError:
        # Exiting with code 0 as directed in the instructions for when the issue is successfully reproduced.
        exit(0)
    except ImportError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate the absence of required dependencies.
        exit(1)
```

This script first tries to import the necessary modules (`numpy` and `astropy.stats.biweight_location`). If these imports fail, it will print a custom stack trace and exit with code 1, indicating that the necessary dependencies are not installed. If the imports are successful but the assertion fails (indicating the issue is present), it will print the stack trace for the `AssertionError` and exit with code 0 as specified. If there's no issue, it indicates success and exits normally.
