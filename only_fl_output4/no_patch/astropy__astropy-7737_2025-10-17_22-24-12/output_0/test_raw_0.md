This Python script aims to reproduce the issue described, where the `biweight_location` function from the `astropy.stats` module returns `nan` for a constant array, instead of its median value. The script includes a custom function to print the stack trace for any caught `AssertionError`, allowing for easier debugging of possible errors linked to the reported problem. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the expected value (1, in this case) is not returned by the function invocation.
