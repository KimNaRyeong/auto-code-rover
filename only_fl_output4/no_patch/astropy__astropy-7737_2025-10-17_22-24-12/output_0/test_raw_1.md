Below is a corrected version of the Python script `reproducer.py` that should work assuming that both `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in your environment. This script specifically aims to reproduce the issue with `biweight_location` returning `nan` for a constant array by incorporating the provided stack trace function for better error visibility. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_constant_array():
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.stats import biweight_location

    try:
        constant_array = np.ones(4)
        result = biweight_location(constant_array)
        # Using numpy's isnan function to check if result is nan and raising an AssertionError if it is
        assert not np.isnan(result), f"Expected biweight_location to return 1, got {result} instead"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # In case of an AssertionError, exiting with code 0 for this specific use case as per the instruction
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_biweight_location_constant_array()
    # If no exception was raised, it means the issue might have been fixed, hence not exiting with code 0
    print("No issue detected.")
```

This script will check if the `biweight_location` function behaves as expected when provided with a constant array. If `biweight_location` returns `nan`, an `AssertionError` is raised, the stack trace is printed, and the script exits with code 0. If any other exception occurs, the stack trace for that exception is printed, and the script exits with code 1. Finally, if no exception is raised, the script concludes that no issue has been detected with the function under the specific test conditions provided.

Please ensure that both `numpy` and `astropy` packages are correctly installed in your environment before running the script. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy astropy
```

Or using conda:

```sh
conda install numpy astropy
```

Depending on the setup of your Python environment.
