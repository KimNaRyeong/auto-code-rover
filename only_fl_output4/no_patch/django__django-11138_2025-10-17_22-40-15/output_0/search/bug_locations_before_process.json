        "intended_behavior": "This method should more intelligently apply timezone conversions based on the database's configured `TIME_ZONE` setting compared to the application's global `TIME_ZONE`. If the database's `TIME_ZONE` is the same as the application's `TIME_ZONE`, it should not perform any conversion using `CONVERT_TZ` to avoid unnecessary dependencies on MySQL timezone tables and to accurately reflect the intended usage of timezones within Django models and database settings. Additionally, consider implementing a check to determine the actual necessity of conversion based on the mentioned settings, ensuring that the method either returns the field name untouched or correctly adjusts the timezone if required by comparing the database's timezone (if explicitly set) against the global setting."
