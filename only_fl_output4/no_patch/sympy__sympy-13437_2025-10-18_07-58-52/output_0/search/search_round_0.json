As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue regarding the incorrect behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` in the SymPy library, we'll need to gather more context about the implementation of both the `bell` function and the `limit` method for this specific case. Given the detailed nature of the problem, it's crucial to understand how limits are calculated within the SymPy framework, especially for special functions like the Bell numbers.\n\nWe should start by examining the following aspects:\n\n1. The implementation of the `bell` function to understand how it's defined and how it handles the infinite case.\n2. The implementation of the `.limit()` method, particularly how it's applied to functions like `bell` to calculate limits as the argument goes to infinity.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following API calls can provide the necessary context to move towards resolving the issue:\n\n- `search_function(\"bell\")`: To find where the Bell function is implemented in the codebase.\n- `search_method(\"limit\")`: To understand how limits are generally handled within the library, especially for special functions."
