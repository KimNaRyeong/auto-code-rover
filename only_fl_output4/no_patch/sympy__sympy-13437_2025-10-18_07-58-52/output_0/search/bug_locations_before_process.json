        "intended_behavior": "The `limit` function should include a condition or heuristic that specifically checks for `bell(n)` where `n` approaches infinity (`oo`). For this scenario, instead of returning an unevaluated expression like `bell(oo)`, the function should return `oo` to correctly reflect the mathematical properties of Bell numbers, which grow without bound as the size of the set increases. This adjustment ensures that the limit operation aligns with the mathematical expectation that the number of partitions of an infinite set is infinite. The modification should be made in such a way that it does not interfere with the current limit evaluation process for other types of functions or expressions to preserve existing functionality."
