To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue mentioned and follows the instructions provided, you can use the content below. This script will attempt to compute `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`, expecting it to evaluate to infinity (`oo` in SymPy). If the evaluation doesn't return infinity but returns `bell(oo)` instead, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace of where the error occurred. Once the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0 without any errors.

```python
from sympy import symbols, bell, oo
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_bell_limit():
    n = symbols('n')
    result = bell(n).limit(n, oo)
    try:
        assert result == oo, "The limit of bell(n) as n approaches infinity should be oo."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_bell_limit()
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary modules from SymPy and the standard library.
2. Defines `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed tracebacks on exception.
3. Defines `test_bell_limit` function to perform the test for computing `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`.
4. Uses an `assert` statement to check whether the result matches the expected outcome (`oo`).
5. Catches `AssertionError` if the outcome is not as expected and prints the stack trace before exiting with code 1.
6. If the test passes (i.e., the issue is fixed), it prints a success message and exits with code 0.

Save this script to the root directory of the SymPy project and run it using Python 3 to test for the issue.
