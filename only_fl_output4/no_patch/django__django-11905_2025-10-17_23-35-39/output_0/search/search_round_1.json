Given that `__isnull` is mentioned in the context of database queries and considering the nature of the issue, it seems likely related to an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or database query interface.\n\n1. To find where `__isnull` lookups are initially defined or handled, we might start by searching for `__isnull` directly in the code to understand its usage patterns or to locate relevant validator functions or classes:\n   - `search_code(\"__isnull\")`\n\n2. Since the issue suggests that an error should be raised for non-boolean values, we should look for any existing validation methods or query parameter processing functions that might be relevant to incorporate this new validation logic. This means identifying methods or classes responsible for processing query lookups or validations:\n   - `search_method(\"validate_lookup\")`\n   - `search_method(\"process_lookup\")`\n\n3. Given the nature of ORMs or query frameworks often having classes dedicated to representing query components or field lookups, we should attempt to locate such classes which might be directly involved with `__isnull` or lookup processing in general. If there's a known class or module pattern for handling lookups or conditions in the ORM/query framework being used, it's a good place to enforce the boolean value constraint for `__isnull`:\n   - `search_class(\"Lookup\")`\n   - `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n   - `search_class(\"FieldLookup\")`\n\nThese API calls should help us gather enough context to begin understanding how `__isnull` is currently used and where we may need to introduce changes to enforce the described constraint."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### `__isnull` in Various Files\nThe search for `__isnull` revealed it is used in multiple files such as `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, and `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`. The presence of `__isnull` in these files suggests it is a query parameter used across Django's ORM for filtering query sets based on whether a field is null or not. \n\n1. **Purpose**: In ORM query construction, `__isnull` likely serves to modify queries to filter records based on the nullity of database fields.\n2. **Relationship to Bug**: The bug reports misuse of `__isnull` with non-boolean values, yet it seems to be functioning due to truthy/falsey evaluation. Given `__isnull`'s use in query construction, incorrect usage could lead to unexpected results or inefficiencies in database querying.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: `__isnull` should strictly accept Boolean values (`True` or `False`) to ensure clear, predictable, and documented behavior when generating SQL queries.\n\n### Lookup Class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`\nThe `Lookup` class is a pivotal part of the ORM's mechanism for constructing query components, possibly including conditions like `__isnull`.\n\n1. **Purpose**: This class likely encapsulates the logic for defining and handling various lookup types in queries, potentially including `__isnull`.\n2. **Relationship to Bug**: Given its role, the `Lookup` class or its derivatives could be the appropriate place to enforce the Boolean value constraint for `__isnull`. The fact that `__isnull` is processed within the scope of a lookup's logic makes `Lookup` a key point for patching the bug.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Within this class or a related component, validating `__isnull` parameters to ensure they are Boolean could be implemented, raising errors when non-Boolean values are used.\n\n### QuerySet Class in `django/db/models/query.py`\nThe `QuerySet` class manages the construction and execution of database queries.\n\n1. **Purpose**: It represents a collection of database queries or records that allows for chainable methods to refine or modify queries before execution.\n2. **Relationship to Bug**: As `QuerySet` methods may utilize lookups like `__isnull` to filter or modify returned records, it's directly related to how `__isnull` lookups are constructed and validates the query parameters.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Although `QuerySet` itself may not be the direct spot for implementing the `__isnull` validation, understanding its internals is crucial for ensuring any modifications to lookup logic are compatible with the broader query construction and execution process.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next step to address the issue should involve examining how lookups, including `__isnull`, are processed within these discovered classes. Specifically, further investigation is needed on how the `Lookup` class handles `__isnull` parameters and where in the process a validation for booleanity could be logically and effectively inserted.\n\nTo gather more context for a potential fix, additional API calls could target the implementation details of the `Lookup` class, specifically methods that directly interact with `__isnull`, or explore how `QuerySet` constructs calls to these lookups. However, given the information provided, the focus might best be placed on the `Lookup` class for implementing the validation logic."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1.\n\n2.\n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: `django/db/models/lookups.py`\n  - **Class**: `Lookup`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `Lookup` class should be modified to ensure that when `__isnull` is processed, the value provided (`rhs` in the context of the class) is verified to be a Boolean. This could be achieved by implementing a new method or adjusting an existing one, such as `get_prep_lookup` or `__init__`, to include a validation step. If a non-Boolean value is detected for `__isnull`, an appropriate exception (e.g., `ValueError`) should be raised. This validation will enforce the usage of `__isnull` strictly with Boolean values, eliminating the undocumented and potentially confusing behavior of accepting truthy/falsy values.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Class**: `QuerySet`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Although the `QuerySet` class might not directly handle the validation of lookup values, ensuring that all methods constructing queries with `__isnull` (such as `filter`, `exclude`, etc.) properly document and, indirectly through the use of `Lookup`, enforce the Boolean constraint of `__isnull` values. This would enhance clarity for developers and maintain consistency across the ORM. The documentation should explicitly mention the required type of `__isnull` to prevent misuse.\n\nThese adjustments will preserve the existing functionality while enforcing the type constraint for `__isnull`, improving code reliability and developer experience."
