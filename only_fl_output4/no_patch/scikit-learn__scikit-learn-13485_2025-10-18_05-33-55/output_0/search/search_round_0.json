If we could, I'd be happy to provide a PR to do so\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively address the issue raised about `CalibratedClassifierCV` being intolerant of 3D input arrays due to its use of `check_array` with default parameters, we need to gather more context about where and how `CalibratedClassifierCV` and `check_array` are implemented and used within the project. The specific details we're looking for include:\n\n- The implementation of `CalibratedClassifierCV` to understand its current handling of input shapes.\n- The usage of `check_array` within `CalibratedClassifierCV` to see if it's essential or if we can modify its behavior to accept 3D inputs.\n- Comparison with how `GridSearchCV` manages its inputs, since the issue mentions it does not call `check_array`, allowing for an easy use of 3D inputs.\n\nHere are the API calls we'll make to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the class `CalibratedClassifierCV` to find its location in the codebase: `search_class(\"CalibratedClassifierCV\")`\n2. Search for any use of `check_array` within the likely file(s) of `CalibratedClassifierCV` or globally to understand its default parameters and invocation context: `search_code(\"check_array\")`\n3. Since `GridSearchCV` is mentioned as a comparison for handling inputs, it would be useful to also look into its implementation or usage to identify how it differs in terms of input validation: `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with detailed context and code locations to determine the feasibility of making `CalibratedClassifierCV` more tolerant of 3D input arrays, and how to best approach creating a patch."
