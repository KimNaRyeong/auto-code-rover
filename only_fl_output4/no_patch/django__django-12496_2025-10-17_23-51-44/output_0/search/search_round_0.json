This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\nPython 3.6, PostgreSQL 9.6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gain an understanding of how the models and possibly related methods are defined and interact in the Django application's codebase. Specifically, we need to inspect the \"Parent\" and \"Child\" classes and any method that might be responsible for the object creation, such as the `create` method or any custom save methods that might be interacting with these models to cause the unexpected behavior.\n\nTherefore, I will perform the following API calls to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the \"Parent\" class definition to understand its structure, especially looking at the custom primary key field.\n2. Search for the \"Child\" class definition to see how it inherits from \"Parent\" and defines its own fields.\n3. Search for any method that might be responsible for saving or creating these model instances, such as `save` or custom methods within these models if the `create` method itself doesn't yield any custom implementations.\n\nHere are the API calls based on these considerations:\n\n- `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n- `search_class(\"Child\")`\n- `search_method(\"create\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`"
