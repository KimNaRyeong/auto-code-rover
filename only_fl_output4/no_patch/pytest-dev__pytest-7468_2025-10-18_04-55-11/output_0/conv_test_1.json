Run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.\n\nThis script will:\n- First, try to reproduce the issue by attempting to create a log file in a non-existent directory. An `AssertionError` is raised if the problem occurs, alongside a stack trace of the issue.\n- Then, it applies the proposed solution (creating the directory structure before trying to create the file) and verifies that the problem does not occur anymore. \n\nRemember, the environment or path might need adjustment according to where you intend to create the log file."
