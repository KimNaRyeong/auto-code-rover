To reproduce the issue described, we need a standalone Python script that simulates the behavior encountered when running `pytest` with a `--log-file` argument pointing to a non-existing subdirectory. Since we are simulating the behavior outside of `pytest`, we'll manually attempt to create a log file in a directory hierarchy that doesn't exist and apply the logic suggested in the initial post to handle directory creation.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_pytest_logfile_issue(logfile_path):
    try:
        # Attempting to write to a logfile in a potentially non-existent directory
        with open(logfile_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is a test log message.")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue present: Failed to automatically create subdirectories for log file.")

def fix_and_simulate(logfile_path):
    try:
        # Attempting to fix the issue by ensuring the directory exists before writing the log file
        dirname = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(logfile_path))
        if not os.path.isdir(dirname):
            os.makedirs(dirname)
        with open(logfile_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write("This is a test log message.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The fix should not raise any exceptions.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test log file path with non-existent subdirectory
    logfile_path = "subtest/test.log"
    
    # Simulate the issue
    try:
        simulate_pytest_logfile_issue(logfile_path)
        print("Issue simulation complete. Now attempting the fix.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
    
    # Apply fix and retest
    try:
        fix_and_simulate(logfile_path)
        print("Fix applied successfully. No exceptions raised.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
```

To use this script:

1. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script will:
- First, try to reproduce the issue by attempting to create a log file in a non-existent directory. An `AssertionError` is raised if the problem occurs, alongside a stack trace of the issue.
- Then, it applies the proposed solution (creating the directory structure before trying to create the file) and verifies that the problem does not occur anymore. 

Remember, the environment or path might need adjustment according to where you intend to create the log file.
