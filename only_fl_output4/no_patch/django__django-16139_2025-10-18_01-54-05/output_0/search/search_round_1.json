If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals several key points relevant to the reported issue and provides insights into potential steps for resolving it.\n\n### Analysis of `UserChangeForm` in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`\n\n#### What it does:\nThe `UserChangeForm` class definition in `forms.py` is crucial for managing user data within Django's admin interface. It includes, among other fields, a `password` field that is read-only and displays a help text directing to a form that allows for password changes. This help text includes an anchor `<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>` which is intended to be dynamically formatted to point to the correct URL for password changes.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug:\nThe issue stems from how the URL in the `password` field's help text is generated. The current code formats the URL with a relative path `\"../password/\"`, which assumes the form is always accessed in a specific way that the UserAdmin change page's URL ends with `{user_id}/change/`. This assumption breaks when accessing UserAdmin through a reference from another model specifying a field other than the primary key, such as a UUID. Consequently, users are directed to a wrong URL resulting in a 404 error.\n\n#### Intended behavior:\nThe intended and correct behavior would be dynamically generating the password reset link based on the actual URL used to access the UserChangeForm. The suggestion in the issue description to replace the relative path in `password.help_text` formatting with `\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\"` aims to directly use the user's primary key, thus ensuring the generated URL remains valid irrespective of the access path.\n\n### Analysis of `change_view` Method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`\n\n#### What it does:\nThe `change_view` method is part of Django's ModelAdmin class, which plays a central role in configuring how models are represented in Django's admin interface. This method specifically deals with the view for changing an existing record, which includes loading and rendering the appropriate form (for instance, `UserChangeForm` for user models).\n\n#### Relationship with the bug:\nWhile the `change_view` method itself doesn't directly generate the faulty URL, understanding its role is crucial for comprehending how forms like `UserChangeForm` are rendered within the Django admin and, by extension, how they might be affected by or influence URL structure. The change form's context, including how URLs are constructed and interpreted within it, directly impacts the functionality in question.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven the analysis, the proposed fix in the issue to adjust the URL formation in the `UserChangeForm`'s `__init__` method appears to address the immediate cause of the 404 error by ensuring that the link to the password reset form correctly reflects the user's primary key. \n\nHowever, before finalizing this approach, testing will be needed to ensure it doesn't introduce other URL resolution issues, especially in complex admin configurations. Additionally, considerations on whether the solution affects or requires adjustments in how `change_view` or other parts of the Django admin machinery operate or interpret URLs would be part of ensuring a comprehensive resolution. \n\nTo move forward, evaluating the impact of this change in various scenarios where `UserChangeForm` is used would be a crucial next step, potentially requiring examining how `change_view` and related admin URL routing logic processes the adjusted URLs."

The current implementation uses `\"../password/\"` as the relative path, which causes issues when accessing the UserAdmin interface in a non-standard way, such as through a `to_field` reference with a UUID.\n\n  To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the password change URL should be generated to reflect direct access to the user's primary key on the admin interface, ensuring compatibility with different access paths. The proposed change involves replacing:\n  \n  ```python\n  password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n  ```\n  \n  With a more dynamic approach that considers the actual path needed to reach the password change form for the specific user instance being modified:\n  \n  ```python\n  password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\n  ```\n  \n  This change ensures that the link to the password reset form is always valid, regardless of how the UserChangeForm is accessed. It leverages the instance's primary key (`self.instance.pk`), making the URL adaptation correctly point to the password change form directly associated with the user being edited, hence effectively fixing the 404 error issue encountered."
