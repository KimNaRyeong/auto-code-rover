97     """
98     Simplify the solution procedure of diophantine equation ``eq`` by
99     converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero.
100 
101     For example, when solving, `x^2 - y^2 = 0` this is treated as
102     `(x + y)(x - y) = 0` and `x + y = 0` and `x - y = 0` are solved
103     independently and combined. Each term is solved by calling
104     ``diop_solve()``.
105 
106     Output of ``diophantine()`` is a set of tuples. The elements of the
107     tuple are the solutions for each variable in the the equation and
108     are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.
109     e.g. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first
110     element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.
111 
112     Usage
113     =====
114 
115     ``diophantine(eq, t, syms)``: Solve the diophantine
116     equation ``eq``.
117     ``t`` is the optional parameter to be used by ``diop_solve()``.
118     ``syms`` is an optional list of symbols which determines the
119     order of the elements in the returned tuple.
120 
121     Details
122     =======
123 
124     ``eq`` should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.
125     ``t`` is the parameter to be used in the solution.
126 
127     Examples
128     ========
129 
130     >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diophantine
131     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
132     >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
133     set([(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)])
134 
135     >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))

</code><intended_behavior>The function should include additional logic to verify if all even powers in the equation are equal. This update involves refining the logic around line 407, where it currently categorizes any equation with terms that have even powers and are greater than 3 into 'general_sum_of_even_powers'. The intended behavior should ensure that this classification only happens if all even-powered terms have the same power. If the powers are even but not the same, it should classify them differently or indicate that the current system cannot handle such cases, to avoid misdirecting the solving logic in `diophantine`. This refinement preserves the function's role in accurately classifying Diophantine equations, which is crucial for routing them to the appropriate solver.</intended_behavior>, <file>sympy/solvers/diophantine.py</file>

97     """
98     Simplify the solution procedure of diophantine equation ``eq`` by
99     converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero.
100 
101     For example, when solving, `x^2 - y^2 = 0` this is treated as
102     `(x + y)(x - y) = 0` and `x + y = 0` and `x - y = 0` are solved
103     independently and combined. Each term is solved by calling
104     ``diop_solve()``.
105 
106     Output of ``diophantine()`` is a set of tuples. The elements of the
107     tuple are the solutions for each variable in the the equation and
108     are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.
109     e.g. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first
110     element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.
111 
112     Usage
113     =====
114 
115     ``diophantine(eq, t, syms)``: Solve the diophantine
116     equation ``eq``.
117     ``t`` is the optional parameter to be used by ``diop_solve()``.
118     ``syms`` is an optional list of symbols which determines the
119     order of the elements in the returned tuple.
120 
121     Details
122     =======
123 
124     ``eq`` should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.
125     ``t`` is the parameter to be used in the solution.
126 
127     Examples
128     ========
129 
130     >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine import diophantine
131     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
132     >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)

</code><intended_behavior>Depending on the modifications made to `classify_diop`, there might be minimal or no necessary adjustments to the `diophantine` method directly. However, if a new classification type for equations with variables raised to different even powers is introduced, `diophantine` may need to account for this new type and possibly handle it specifically, or at least fail gracefully by informing the user that such equations cannot be solved yet. The intended behavior here ensures that `diophantine` can either properly solve or accurately report the inability to solve equations based on their updated classification from `classify_diop`. This adjustment ensures the solver's response is both accurate and informative, aligning with the classifications provided by `classify_diop`.</intended_behavior>]
