        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Function` method is meant to handle the printing of functions to LaTeX format correctly, adhering to the `inv_trig_style` specified by the user. To resolve the issue, the `inv_trig_table` within this method should be extended to include `acsc` and `asec`. By adding these to the `inv_trig_table`, the method should recognize `acsc(x)` and `asec(x)` as inverse trigonometric functions that, when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is used, are transformed to `'\\arccsc{\\left (x \\right )}'` and `'\\arcsec{\\left (x \\right )}'`. This change preserves the existing functionality for inverse trigonometric functions already covered (`asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `acot`) and extends it to the previously unsupported `acsc` and `asec`, aligning the behavior with user expectations and the documented or implied behavior of the setting."
