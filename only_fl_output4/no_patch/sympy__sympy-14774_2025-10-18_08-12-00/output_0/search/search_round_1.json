        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from `sympy/printing/latex.py` within the `LatexPrinter` class, specifically the `_print_Function` method, provides insight into how SymPy handles the LaTeX representation of inverse trigonometric functions. Here are the observations based on the questions:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The snippet around line 743 defines how inverse trigonometric functions are printed in LaTeX by SymPy's `LatexPrinter`. It introduces the `inv_trig_table` array, which lists the trigonometric functions that, when their inverse is encountered, will be treated specially depending on the `inv_trig_style` setting.\n- Options for `inv_trig_style` include `abbreviated` (e.g., `asin`), `full` (e.g., `arcsin`), and `power` (e.g., `sin^{-1}`). Depending on this setting, inverse trigonometric functions are printed accordingly.\n- For full names (`\"full\"` style), it prefixes `arc` to the function name, transforming, for example, `asin` to `arcsin`.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\n- The bug described in the issue is that full names for the inverse cosecant and secant functions (`acsc` and `asec`) are not supported. Instead of printing `\\\\arccsc` and `\\\\arcsec`, it prints them as `\\\\operatorname{acsc}` and `\\\\operatorname{asec}`.\n- This issue stems from the fact that `acsc` and `asec` are not listed in the `inv_trig_table` used to check if a function is an inverse trigonometric function for which the `arc` prefix should be applied when `inv_trig_style` is set to `\"full\"`.\n\n### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- The intended behavior, as indicated by the issue description, is that when generating LaTeX for inverse trigonometric functions with `inv_trig_style` set to `\"full\"`, the function names for `acsc` and `asec` should also include `arc` as a prefix, resulting in `arccsc` and `arcsec`.\n- To achieve this, `acsc` and `asec` need to be added to the `inv_trig_table`, ensuring they are recognized as functions that require the `arc` prefix in full name style. This change will ensure the consistent treatment of all inverse trigonometric functions in LaTeX presentations, aligning with the expected output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the solution to the issue would involve adding `acsc` and `asec` to the `inv_trig_table` array, as specified in the issue description, to support the full naming convention for these functions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Bug Location:\n   - File: sympy/printing/latex.py\n   - Class: LatexPrinter\n   - Method: _print_Function\n   - Intended Behavior: The `_print_Function` method is meant to handle the printing of functions to LaTeX format correctly, adhering to the `inv_trig_style` specified by the user. To resolve the issue, the `inv_trig_table` within this method should be extended to include `acsc` and `asec`. By adding these to the `inv_trig_table`, the method should recognize `acsc(x)` and `asec(x)` as inverse trigonometric functions that, when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is used, are transformed to `'\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` and `'\\\\arcsec{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`. This change preserves the existing functionality for inverse trigonometric functions already covered (`asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `acot`) and extends it to the previously unsupported `acsc` and `asec`, aligning the behavior with user expectations and the documented or implied behavior of the setting."
