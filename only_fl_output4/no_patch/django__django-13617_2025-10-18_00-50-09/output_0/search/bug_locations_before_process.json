        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the code should be modified to correctly handle annotations that contain subqueries within GROUP BY clauses. Specifically, the patch suggests adjusting the condition to include annotation_names when constructing the group_by list. This change aims to ensure that:\n\n  - Annotated fields, especially those involving subqueries, are recognized and handled correctly in the GROUP_BY clause construction process. This involves using the alias of annotated subqueries directly rather than treating them as new expressions to be evaluated or incorrectly adding fields to the GROUP BY clause that shouldn't be there.\n  - The existing functionality where annotations without subqueries and other groupings are handled correctly should remain intact. The change should specifically address the mishandling of subquery annotations without disrupting the valid processing of other types of annotations or expressions within the GROUP_BY clause.\n\nThe overall intended behavior is to ensure accurate and efficient execution of queries involving complex annotations and groupings, upholding the ORM's ability to express and execute sophisticated queries without resorting to raw SQL or encountering incorrect results."
