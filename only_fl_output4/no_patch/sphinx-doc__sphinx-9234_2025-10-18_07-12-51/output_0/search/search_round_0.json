Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To tackle the feature request efficiently and gather the necessary code for crafting a patch, the following information is crucial:\n\n1. The class that handles the link checking logic. Without a specific class name mentioned in the issue, we might need to identify it based on terms like \"LinkChecker\" or something similar, assuming there's a dedicated class for this functionality.\n2. The method or process that handles the redirection or checks the URLs. Likely methods might include keywords such as \"redirect\", \"checkUrl\", \"validateLink\", or similar.\n3. Configuration or storage of URLs and their allowed redirects, if this already exists in some form.\n\nGiven these needs, I propose the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for handling link checks. Since we don't have an exact class name, we start with a broad search based on common naming conventions around link checking functionalities.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once the class responsible for link checking is identified, search for methods that might handle redirects or URL validation to understand how redirects are currently processed and determine where the new feature can be integrated.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"validateLink\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"checkRedirect\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n3. If there is a configuration file or method that defines or allows for URL handling, including redirects, it's important to understand its structure to see how the new feature could be integrated or if it even exists.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"allowed redirects\")\n   search_code(\"url config\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls should provide a solid understanding of the current link checking mechanism, how it handles redirects, and where we can introduce the ability to prohibit unknown redirects as requested in the issue."
