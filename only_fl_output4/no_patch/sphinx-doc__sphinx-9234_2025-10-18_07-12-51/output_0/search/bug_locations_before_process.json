        "intended_behavior": "This file should be modified or extended to include: Configuration Handling: A mechanism to define and load allowed redirect pairs from the Sphinx configuration (e.g., in `conf.py`). This could involve adding a new configuration option such as `linkcheck_allowed_redirects` that accepts a list of tuples specifying allowed source and destination URL pairs. Redirect Validation: Modify or enhance the redirection handling logic to cross-check any encountered redirects against the list of allowed redirect pairs. Only redirects that match a pair in the list should be allowed. If a redirect does not match any allowed pair, it should be flagged as an error or warning. Reporting: Ensure that any disallowed redirects are reported to the user in a clear and actionable manner, potentially as part of the existing linkcheck output/reporting mechanism."
