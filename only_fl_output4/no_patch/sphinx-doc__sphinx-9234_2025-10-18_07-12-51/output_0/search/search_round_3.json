The issue description revolves around handling redirects and link checking.

The requirement to list allowed redirects as pairs of URLs suggests that there could be a data structure or configuration file where these pairs are meant to be defined or already exist in some form.\n\n4. The alternative considered in the issue talks about post-processing a specific output file, suggesting there might be a logging or reporting component that could be relevant to the feature request.\n\nBased on these observations, here are the refined API calls to make next:\n\n- Since \"LinkChecker\" was not found, look for more generic but related functionalities that would likely include handling of URLs, possibly within a broader scope utility service.\n  \n  ```python\n  search_class(\"URLHandler\")\n  search_class(\"RedirectService\")\n  ```\n\n- Investigate how the project handles files, especially around outputting results, in case the link checking process is part of a broader file handling or reporting functionality.\n  \n  ```python\n  search_code(\"output.txt\")\n  search_method(\"writeOutput\")\n  ```\n\n- To address the specifics of configuring or identifying allowed redirects, search for any mention of URL configuration or data structures that represent pairs of URLs.

The references to \"redirect\" within this file suggest it also contains logic for handling HTTP redirects encountered during the link checking process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This file is directly related to the issue at hand, as the feature request involves enhancing how Sphinx's link checker handles redirects. Specifically, the feature aims to allow the prohibition of unknown redirects by listing all allowed redirects as pairs of URLs. Therefore, the handling of redirects during the link checking process, which is managed within this file, is the focus for introducing the requested functionality.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - To resolve the issue, the code within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` should be extended or modified to:\n     - Support a configuration mechanism that allows specifying pairs of \"source URL\" to \"allowed destination URL\" to represent the allowed redirects explicitly.\n     - Modify the link checking algorithm to validate redirects against this list of permitted redirects. When a redirect is encountered, the checker should verify if the \"source URL\" to \"redirect destination URL\" pair matches any in the allowed list.\n       - If a match is found, the redirect can be considered valid.\n       - If no match is found, the redirect should be flagged as invalid, ideally reporting an error or a warning according to the configuration.\n   \n   This behavior integrates the prohibition of unknown redirects into the existing link checking process without impairing the functionality to automatically follow and validate legitimate redirects, enhancing the tool's ability to maintain link accuracy in documentation.\n\nGiven this analysis, detailed examination and modification of the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file are essential steps for implementing the requested feature. Further exploration, such as reviewing the specific methods and logic inside this file related to redirect handling and configuration, will be necessary to craft a precise solution."

This could involve adding a new configuration option such as `linkcheck_allowed_redirects` that accepts a list of tuples specifying allowed source and destination URL pairs.\n     - **Redirect Validation:** Modify or enhance the redirection handling logic to cross-check any encountered redirects against the list of allowed redirect pairs. Only redirects that match a pair in the list should be allowed. If a redirect does not match any allowed pair, it should be flagged as an error or warning.\n     - **Reporting:** Ensure that any disallowed redirects are reported to the user in a clear and actionable manner, potentially as part of the existing linkcheck output/reporting mechanism.\n     \n   This approach maintains the existing functionality of following and validating redirects while introducing the ability to prohibit unspecified redirects explicitly.
