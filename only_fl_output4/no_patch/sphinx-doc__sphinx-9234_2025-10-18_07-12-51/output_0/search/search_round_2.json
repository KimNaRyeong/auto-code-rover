Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

The class that handles the link checking logic. Without a specific class name mentioned in the issue, we might need to identify it based on terms like \"LinkChecker\" or something similar, assuming there's a dedicated class for this functionality.\n2. The method or process that handles the redirection or checks the URLs. Likely methods might include keywords such as \"redirect\", \"checkUrl\", \"validateLink\", or similar.\n3. Configuration or storage of URLs and their allowed redirects, if this already exists in some form.\n\nGiven these needs, I propose the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for handling link checks. Since we don't have an exact class name, we start with a broad search based on common naming conventions around link checking functionalities.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once the class responsible for link checking is identified, search for methods that might handle redirects or URL validation to understand how redirects are currently processed and determine where the new feature can be integrated.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"validateLink\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"checkRedirect\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n3.

Since \"LinkChecker\", \"validateLink\", \"checkRedirect\", \"allowed redirects\", and \"url config\" didn't provide any leads, let's consider alternative approaches:\n\n1. The issue description revolves around handling redirects and link checking. Since we didn't find anything under \"LinkChecker\" or directly related to redirects, it's possible that the functionality is part of a larger utility or service within the project that's not exclusively dedicated to link checking but includes it as a feature.\n\n2. The request mentions \"linkcheck/output.txt\", implying that the link checking process might output results to a file. This clue suggests that file handling or output generation functionalities might be a good angle to explore.\n\n3. The requirement to list allowed redirects as pairs of URLs suggests that there could be a data structure or configuration file where these pairs are meant to be defined or already exist in some form.\n\n4. The alternative considered in the issue talks about post-processing a specific output file, suggesting there might be a logging or reporting component that could be relevant to the feature request.\n\nBased on these observations, here are the refined API calls to make next:\n\n- Since \"LinkChecker\" was not found, look for more generic but related functionalities that would likely include handling of URLs, possibly within a broader scope utility service.\n  \n  ```python\n  search_class(\"URLHandler\")\n  search_class(\"RedirectService\")\n  ```\n\n- Investigate how the project handles files, especially around outputting results, in case the link checking process is part of a broader file handling or reporting functionality.\n  \n  ```python\n  search_code(\"output.txt\")\n  search_method(\"writeOutput\")\n  ```\n\n- To address the specifics of configuring or identifying allowed redirects, search for any mention of URL configuration or data structures that represent pairs of URLs. This might include configurations in code or external files.\n  \n  ```python\n  search_code(\"redirect pairs\")\n  search_code(\"URL configuration\")\n  ```\n  \nThese alternative searches aim to uncover the mechanism or components in the project that deal with URLs, redirection handling, and configuration management, providing the necessary context to approach the feature request effectively."
