        "content": "To resolve the issue mentioned about the `linsolve` function failing with certain systems of equations, we need more context around the implementation and usage of this function within the `sympy` library. Given that `linsolve` is a method in `sympy`, we can start by searching for the method implementation and its usage. Additionally, understanding the classes or methods that interact with `linsolve` might also provide insights into why it behaves unexpectedly for specific equations.\n\nLet's start with the following search API calls to gather the required context:\n\n- `search_method(\"linsolve\")`: This will help find where `linsolve` is defined and used in the `sympy` codebase.\n- `search_code(\"Eq(y, x)\")`: Searching for the usage of `sympy.Eq` in the context of defining equations might reveal how equations are typically handled and if there's a common pattern or issue related to equations resembling those in the issue description.\n- `search_code(\"FiniteSet((0, 0))\")`: This will help in understanding how `FiniteSet` is used in the context of `linsolve` solutions, especially since two of the provided examples result in this output."
