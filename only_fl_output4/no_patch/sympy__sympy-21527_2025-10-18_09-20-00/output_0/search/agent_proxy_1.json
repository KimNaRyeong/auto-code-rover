To resolve the issue, the method might need enhanced logic to more robustly handle numerical precision or to improve the differentiation between systems with unique solutions and those that are underdetermined. This could involve refining the threshold or criteria used during the determination phase of the solution's nature (unique vs. infinite solutions). The existing functionality to solve linear equations accurately must be preserved while ensuring that similar systems of equations, even when involving minor numerical coefficient differences, consistently yield equivalent types of solutions.\n    \nGiven the current context and analysis, the primary focus for a resolution seems to center on the `linsolve` method itself, possibly in the way it interprets or processes the numerical data leading to inconsistent outcomes. Any changes or debugging efforts should aim not to alter the expected output for the correctly functioning scenarios but should instead target an improved and more consistent handling of numerically close coefficient values within the equations it solves."
