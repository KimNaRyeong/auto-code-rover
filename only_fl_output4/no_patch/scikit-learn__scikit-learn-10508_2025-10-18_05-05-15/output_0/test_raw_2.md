I understand you're looking for a `reproducer.py` script that tests for the specific issue of `LabelEncoder` failing on empty lists under conditions that result in a type mismatch. Here's a script that does just that, incorporating the stack trace printing function you provided. If the issue is present, the script will print a detailed stack trace. If the issue has been fixed, the script should exit with code 0 without raising an `AssertionError`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_label_encoder_transform_with_empty_input():
    le = LabelEncoder()
    # Fitting with integer labels
    le.fit([1, 2])
    try:
        result_int = le.transform([])
        assert np.array_equal(result_int, np.array([], dtype=int)), "Integer test passed, but it should not."
    except Exception as e:
        print("Integer label test failed as expected.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Fitting with string labels
    le.fit(["a", "b"])
    try:
        result_str = le.transform([])
        assert np.array_equal(result_str, np.array([], dtype='<U32')), "String test failed when it should not."
        # If the code reaches this point, the issue has been fixed.
        print("Issue appears to be resolved for both integer and string inputs.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print("String label test threw an unexpected exception.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_label_encoder_transform_with_empty_input()
```

This script starts by importing necessary modules and defining the `print_stacktrace` function as you've instructed. In `test_label_encoder_transform_with_empty_input`, it performs two tests on `LabelEncoder`:
1. It fits `LabelEncoder` with integer labels and tries to transform an empty array. It is expected to work, and if an exception is caught, the exception details are printed.
2. It fits `LabelEncoder` with string labels and tries to transform an empty array. The issue originally noted is expected to occur here, but if the function correctly processes the empty array (i.e., the exception is not raised), it indicates the issue is resolved, printing a message and exiting with code 0.

If any test raises an exception where it shouldn't, the script prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. The condition checks and assertions are directly related to the described issue, ensuring clarity in output depending on whether the issue is replicated or resolved.
