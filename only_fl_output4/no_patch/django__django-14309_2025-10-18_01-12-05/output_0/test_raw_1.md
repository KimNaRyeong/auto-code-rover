To address the previous issues and ensure the script can run in a more generic setup without depending on a specific Django project's configuration, let's write a modified version of the `reproducer.py` script. This script will dynamically set up a minimal Django environment, avoiding the need for an external Django project setup. It will attempt to replicate the described issue involving the combination of an empty `Q` object with a negated `Exists` expression and verify the expected behavior.

Please copy the following script into a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of a minimal or dummy Django project setup. If you don't have a Django environment ready, first install Django using pip (`pip install django`) and then proceed with the script execution.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    import os
    import django
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.apps import apps

    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    settings.configure(
        BASE_DIR=BASE_DIR,
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            '__main__',
        ),
        TIME_ZONE='UTC',
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()
    apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

    from django.db import models

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        class Meta:
            app_label = '__main__'

    global Book
    try:
        Book.objects.all().count()  # Force model creation
    except Exception:
        pass  # Ignore any errors which might occur if the table doesn't exist

def test_combination():
    from django.db.models import Exists, Q

    q = Q() & ~Exists(Book.objects.all())
    if q.negated:
        print("Test passed: The combination correctly resulted in a negated Q object.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Test failed: Combining an empty Q with a negated Exists did not result in a negated Q object.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_django_environment()
        test_combination()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script configures a minimal Django environment on-the-fly, defining a `Book` model directly within the script for simplicity. This setup prevents the need for a pre-configured Django project, making it easier to test the described issue in a standalone manner.

Remember, this script dynamically creates a Django environment and a model within the runtime context, so it may differ in behavior from more complex setups and should ideally be tested within a controlled environment. 

The script attempts to encapsulate the issue verification logic exclusively within its scope, catching assertion errors to output a stack trace for debugging purposes. Upon successful execution, it exits with code 0. In the case of an error or if the issue is present, it prints the stack trace for diagnostic purposes and exits with code 1.
