Below is the standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, that reproduces the issue described. Be sure to have Django installed and a Django project setup to use this script, as it requires a Django environment with a defined `Book` model. If you don't have a `Book` model, please adjust the model name accordingly in the script. For simplicity, the script assumes that Django is already configured (settings are properly set up, including database settings).

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists, Q
from django.test import TestCase

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.settings')
django.setup()

# Example model definition, ensure it exists or modify accordingly.
# If this model does not exist in your project, create it, or replace 'Book' with an existing model.
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class TestEmptyQExistsCombination(TestCase):
    def test_combine_negated(self):
        try:
            q = Q() & ~Exists(Book.objects.all())
            assert q.negated, "Combining an empty Q with a negated Exists did not negate the Q object as expected."
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TestCase.run = lambda self, *args, **kw: None
    test_case = TestEmptyQExistsCombination()
    test_case._pre_setup()
    try:
        test_case.test_combine_negated()
        print("No issue found. Exiting with code 0.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred, indicating the presence of the issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        test_case._post_teardown()
        exit(1)
    test_case._post_teardown()
    exit(0)
```

Before running this script, replace `'YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.settings'` with the path to your Django project settings. Make sure you have a `Book` model or modify the script to use an existing model in your project.

This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, showing a stack trace of where the failure occurred. It exits with code 0 if no issue is found (indicative of an environment where the issue is fixed or not present).
