Given your feedback, let me provide a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script focusing accurately on checking for a condition that precisely matches your needs. This version of the script will execute the notebook, convert it to LaTeX, then specifically look for the math environment issue within the LaTeX output.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys
import tempfile

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Create a temporary directory to work within
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
        notebook_path = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "temp_notebook.ipynb")
        latex_output_path = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "output.tex")
        
        notebook_content = """

            # Check if problematic code is in the LaTeX output
            if "$$\\begin{equation*}" in latex_content and "\\end{equation*}$$" in latex_content:
                raise AssertionError("Detected problematic LaTeX code indicating issue is present.")

            print("Issue is not present, exiting with code 0.")
            sys.exit(0)

        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)

            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script focuses on executing a Jupyter notebook that includes an example which would trigger the problematic LaTeX output, then checks the converted LaTeX content for the issue described. It uses a temporary directory to keep the files generated during its execution, ensuring no clutter is left behind.

This version explicitly checks for the occurrence of the problematic LaTeX code snip (`$$\\begin{equation*}` to `\\end{equation*}$$`) in the output, ensuring it detects the specific error scenario you've described. If found, it raises an `AssertionError` and provides a stack trace. If not, it exits cleanly with a message indicating the issue is not present.
