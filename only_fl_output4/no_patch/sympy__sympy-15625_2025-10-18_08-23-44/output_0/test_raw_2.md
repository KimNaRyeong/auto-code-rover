Based on your requirements for a standalone `reproducer.py` Python script that will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and exit with code 0 when it is fixed, the following implementation attempts to directly address the problem you've outlined regarding Jupyter notebook's LaTeX output.

The strategy here is to simulate what was described:
1. Creating a minimal Jupyter notebook containing the issue.
2. Converting the notebook to LaTeX with `nbconvert`.
3. Searching the generated LaTeX file for the problematic pattern.
4. Handling environments to properly replicate the behavior, including subprocess invocation and managing temporary files.

```python
import json
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_notebook(filepath):
    nb_content = {
        "cells": [{"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"data": {"text/latex": ["\\begin{equation*}1\\end{equation*}"]}, "output_type": "execute_result", "metadata": {}, "execution_count": 1}], "source": ["import sympy as sp\n", "sp.init_printing()\n", "sp.Integer(1)"]}],
        "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}},
        "nbformat": 4,
        "nbformat_minor": 2
    }
    with open(filepath, 'w') as nb_file:
        json.dump(nb_content, nb_file)

def check_latex_for_issue(latex_file):
    with open(latex_file, 'r') as lf:
        contents = lf.read()
        if "$$\\begin{equation*}" in contents and "\\end{equation*}$$" in contents:
            raise AssertionError("Detected problematic LaTeX code indicating issue is present.")

def main():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        nb_path = os.path.join(tmpdir, "issue_notebook.ipynb")
        create_notebook(nb_path)

        try:
            out_tex = "output"
            subprocess.check_call(["jupyter-nbconvert", "--to", "latex", nb_path, "--output", out_tex], cwd=tmpdir)
            check_latex_for_issue(os.path.join(tmpdir, f"{out_tex}.tex"))
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

        print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script will first create a temporary Jupyter notebook that should, based on the issue description, generate the problematic LaTeX output upon conversion. It then uses `nbconvert` to convert this notebook to a LaTeX format, subsequently analyzing the generated `.tex` file to identify if the documented issue (`$$\begin{equation*} ... \end{equation*}$$`) exists in the file. If found, it will raise an `AssertionError`; if not, it confirms the absence of the issue by exiting with code 0.

Please ensure that:
- You have the required dependencies (`jupyter`, `nbconvert`, and a LaTeX distribution if converting to PDF) installed in your environment.
- You are running this script in an environment where command-line invocation of `jupyter-nbconvert` is possible.
