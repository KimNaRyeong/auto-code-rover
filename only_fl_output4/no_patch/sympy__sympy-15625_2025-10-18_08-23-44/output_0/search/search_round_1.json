        "content": "Analyzing the results from the `search_code(\"$$\")` call, we find that the pattern `$$` appears in several files throughout the SymPy library, specifically within various modules like `sympy/interactive/printing.py`, `sympy/printing/latex.py`, and others. Given the context of the issue description concerning Jupyter notebook's LaTeX output error, our primary focus should be on those parts of the code that deal with LaTeX formatting or printing, as these would be directly related to how mathematical expressions are represented in LaTeX.\n\n### Analysis of Located Codes\n\n1. **SymPy Interactive Printing (`sympy/interactive/printing.py`)**: This file might contain code related to initializing or setting up printing options in SymPy, which might include configuring how expressions are rendered in interactive environments like Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n2. **SymPy Printing LaTeX (`sympy/printing/latex.py`)**: Given that this file contains the most matches (10 occurrences), it's highly likely to be where LaTeX output formatting is handled. The usage of `$$` in LaTeX is typically to denote the beginning and end of a display math block. The issue describes a problem with using `$$\\begin{equation*}...\\end{equation*}$$`, suggesting that the error arises when a display math environment is improperly nested inside another display math environment caused by `$$`. Since the `latex.py` file probably deals with converting SymPy expressions to LaTeX strings, it stands to reason that this file is a crucial area for addressing the issue.\n\n3. **Absence of `$\\displaystyle` search results**: The inability to find references to `$\\displaystyle` in the codebase may indicate that the proposed solution (changing from `$$`...`$$` to `$\\displaystyle`...`$`) is not yet implemented in any part of the SymPy library. This also suggests that modifications might be needed, especially in the parts of the code identified as using `$$`.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe intended behavior seems clear: when SymPy expressions are rendered to LaTeX in a Jupyter Notebook, the LaTeX code produced should not cause errors upon compilation. Specifically, display math environments should not be nested within `$$`, which is another display math indicator in LaTeX. Therefore, the code responsible for generating LaTeX strings from SymPy expressions needs to be adjusted to ensure it correctly formats expressions without leading to nested display math environments.\n\nGiven the issue description, our next steps involve a closer look at `sympy/printing/latex.py`, as modifications here are likely necessary to solve the issue. We should examine how this file constructs LaTeX strings from mathematical expressions, especially looking for parts of the code that wrap expressions in `$$`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo proceed, we might consider inspecting the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file more closely, specifically:\n\n- Searching for methods in `latex.py` that deal with converting expressions to LaTeX strings, which would likely involve the handling of `$$`.\n- Looking into how display math environments are managed in the LaTeX conversion process within this file.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we aim to understand the current behavior and devise a solution aligned with the intended behavior outlined in the issue description. Given this analysis, the next appropriate API call would be:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"$$\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")\n```"

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Location:**\n   - File: `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n   - This file is likely to contain the code that generates LaTeX strings from SymPy objects. Given the nature of the issue, the problematic sections will be those responsible for wrapping mathematical expressions in `$$` delimiters, which is incorrect when generating an `equation*` environment, as this results in nested display math environments leading to LaTeX compilation errors.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- The code in `sympy/printing/latex.py` that handles the generation of LaTeX strings for mathematical expressions should be modified to:\n  - Not wrap expressions with `$$` when an `equation*` or similar environment is used, because `equation*` already denotes a math environment and adding `$$` around it is redundant and leads to errors. The correction should ensure that expressions intended for display are correctly wrapped to prevent LaTeX compilation issues.\n  - Adopt the proposed solution from the issue description, which is to change from `$$`...`$$` to `$\\displaystyle`...`$` for expressions that need to be displayed. This change implies ensuring that expressions are wrapped in such a way that they can be rendered appropriately in LaTeX without causing the \"Bad math environment delimiter\" error.\n  - Ensure that this modification preserves existing functionality for other types of mathematical expressions and LaTeX environments that do not lead to this specific issue, meaning that the correction should be contextual and apply only where necessary to avoid introducing new issues with LaTeX rendering of expressions.\n\nIn summary, modifications in `sympy/printing/latex.py` should specifically address the incorrect wrapping of expressions in `$$` when converting to LaTeX, substituting this with the appropriate `$\\displaystyle` prefix where relevant and ensuring that expressions are not improperly nested within display math environments."
