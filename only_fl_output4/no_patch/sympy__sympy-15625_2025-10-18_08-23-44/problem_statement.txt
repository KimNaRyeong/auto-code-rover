Jupyter notebook LaTeX output breaks when processed in LaTeX, ironically
Steps to reproduce:

* Create a Jupyter notebook (named, say, `mynotebook.ipynb`) with this content:

  ```python
  import sympy as sp
  sp.init_printing()
  1
  ```

* Convert it to LaTeX (you can remove the `--execute` flag if you saved the result in the notebook):

      python3 -m nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --execute --to pdf

This creates the error (originating from LaTeX):

```
...
! LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.300     $$\begin{equation*}
                             1\end{equation*}$$
? 
! Emergency stop.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.300     $$\begin{equation*}
                             1\end{equation*}$$
...
```

If you only convert `--to latex`, you'll see that this LaTeX code is generated:

```latex
...
\texttt{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}1}]:}
    
    $$\begin{equation*}1\end{equation*}$$
...
```

The reason for this error message is that the `equation*` environment is meant to be used in text mode, but sandwiching the whole thing between `$$` switches to math mode.

In this case the `$$` should simply be removed, but a general solution to this problem might be more involved.
LaTeX printing: $$...$$ -> $\displaystyle ...$
#### References to other Issues or PRs

Same thing for IPython: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/11357

Somewhat related: https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/892

#### Brief description of what is fixed or changed

Change the LaTeX wrapping from `$$`...`$$` to `$\displaystyle `...`$`

#### Other comments

This left-aligns expressions when exporting to LaTeX.

#### Release Notes

<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->
* printing
  * change from `$$`...`$$` to `$\displaystyle `...`$` to allow left-aligning in LaTeX documents
<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->
