Additionally, understanding the `pytest_collect_file` hook could also be beneficial as it seems to be a starting point for these errors.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"BlackItem\")`: To find where the `BlackItem` class is defined.\n2. `search_class(\"CheckdocsItem\")`: To find where the `CheckdocsItem` class is defined.\n3. `search_method(\"pytest_collect_file\")`: To find implementations or references to the `pytest_collect_file` hook, which could give us clues on how `from_parent` is called.\n4. `search_code(\"from_parent\")`: To locate occurrences of `from_parent` calls related to both `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem`, since the issue specifies errors in these calls."
