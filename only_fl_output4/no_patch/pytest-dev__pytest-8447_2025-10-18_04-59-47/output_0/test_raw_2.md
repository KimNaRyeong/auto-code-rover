Given the complexity of your request, let's take a slightly different approach to write a `reproducer.py`. Instead of executing external commands via subprocess, which has shown to be problematic due to environment and dependency issues, we'll directly interact with the pytest API and the specific plugins (black and checkdocs) in a controlled manner.

This approach bypasses the need for pip-run and assumes that the necessary packages (`pytest`, `pytest-black`, `pytest-checkdocs`) are installed in the environment where this script runs. This gives a higher chance of directly hitting the code path that triggers the reported issue, albeit while losing some of the environmental fidelity compared to running in subprocesses.

```python
import pytest
from _pytest.config import ExitCode
from pytest_black import BlackItem
from pytest_checkdocs import CheckdocsItem

def test_pytest_plugins_issue():
    # Try to simulate what pytest-black and pytest-checkdocs do internally
    try:
        black_item = BlackItem.from_parent(None, fspath="dummy_path")
        checkdocs_item = CheckdocsItem.from_parent(None, fspath="dummy_path")
        assert False, "Expected TypeError was not raised."
    except TypeError as e:
        if 'unexpected keyword argument \'path\'' not in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, f"Unexpected error occurred: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all for any other unexpected exceptions
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, f"An error occurred: {e}"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Directly invoking pytest.main() with this file as the target, capturing output for analysis
    pytest.main([__file__])
```

### Explanation:

- This script programmatically creates items similar to what `pytest-black` and `pytest-checkdocs` might attempt, using their API but avoids the precise path that requires a fully initialized pytest environment, which we cannot easily replicate in a brief script.

- It checks for the TypeError associated with the `unexpected keyword argument 'path'`, ensuring that if this specific error is raised, it implies the issue is present. If any other exception or error is caught, it's handled separately to give clear feedback.

- Note: The direct usage of plugin-specific API like `BlackItem.from_parent` and `CheckdocsItem.from_parent` is somewhat contrived and might not fully reproduce the environment as the original issue describes since it bypasses much of pytest's initialization and configuration logic. However, given the constraints, this is a viable approach to trigger the specific code path in question.

- You must ensure that the Python environment where you run this script has `pytest`, `pytest-black`, and `pytest-checkdocs` installed with versions compatible with your investigation.

- Running this script directly with Python will internally call `pytest.main()`, treating this script as a pytest test module. Depending on the outcome, it should provide a clear indication if the issue you're investigating can be reproduced within this constrained setup.
