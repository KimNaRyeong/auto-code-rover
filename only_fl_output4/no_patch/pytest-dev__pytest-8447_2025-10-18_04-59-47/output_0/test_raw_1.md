To correctly address the scenario described and execute a script that attempts to reproduce the described issue, while also making sure it caters to the correction provided in the error message, follow this revised approach in `reproducer.py`. This version uses subprocess to trigger the pytest commands, aiming to closely simulate the environment where the issue occurs, and properly formats the command arguments.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def main():
    try:
        # Commands to reproduce the issue for pytest-black and pytest-checkdocs
        commands = [
            ["pip-run", "-q", "git+https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest", "pytest-black", "--", "-m", "pytest", "--black"],
            ["pip-run", "-q", "git+https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest", "pytest-checkdocs", "--", "-m", "pytest"]
        ]

        for cmd in commands:
            result = subprocess.run(cmd, text=True, capture_output=True)
            if 'unexpected keyword argument \'path\'' in result.stdout or 'unexpected keyword argument \'path\'' in result.stderr:
                raise TypeError("Received unexpected keyword argument 'path'")

        # If the script reaches this point without raising the TypeError,
        # it means the issue was not reproduced.
        print("The issue was not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate error

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Changes and Notes:

1. **Use of `subprocess.run`:** To better simulate the execution environment and handle commands as they would be inputted in a CLI. This change ensures the accurate execution of the pip-run and pytest commands within the script environment.

2. **Checking Both stdout and stderr:** This script checks both standard output and standard error for the presence of the specific error message. This is crucial because the TypeError might not always occur in the same output stream depending on the execution context.

3. **Exit Codes:** The script exits with code 0 if the issue was not reproduced, indicating a successful run without the specific error being triggered. It exits with code 1 if the TypeError is caught, signaling that the problem persists.

4. **Print Stack Trace Only for TypeError:** The custom `print_stacktrace` function is invoked only when the TypeError related to the 'path' keyword argument is caught. This helps focus the debugging on the specific issue described.

Remember to adjust permissions to execute the script (`chmod +x reproducer.py`) and to have the required Python packages and tools (`pip-run`, `git`, etc.) available in your environment.
