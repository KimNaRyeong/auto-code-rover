This `reproducer.py` script attempts to reproduce the issue outlined in your description by directly invoking `pytest` with the plugins `pytest_black` and `pytest_checkdocs` using a simulated `pip-run` environment. If the issue is present, it captures the `TypeError` related to the unexpected keyword argument 'path', prints the stack trace with line numbers and exits successfully (`exit(0)`), indicating the issue was successfully reproduced.

Please note, adjustments may be necessary based on the specific environment and versions of `pytest`, `pytest_black`, and `pytest_checkdocs` plugins. You may need to ensure that these packages are installed in your Python environment, or modify the dependencies to match the environment where the issue was initially observed. Also, this script assumes direct execution context and may need modifications for integration into larger testing or CI/CD workflows.
