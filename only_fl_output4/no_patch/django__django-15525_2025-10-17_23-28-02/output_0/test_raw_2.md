Based on your request, here is a `reproducer.py` script designed to be executed in the root directory of your Django project. This script attempts to recreate the reported issue regarding `loaddata` command failure on a non-default database when dealing with natural keys that use foreign keys.

```python
"""
Run this script from the Django project root directory using:
python3 reproducer.py
"""

import os
import django
import sys
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.conf import settings

# Use the print_stacktrace function as provided
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django settings required for the script to run.
# Adjust DATABASES according to your project configuration.
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'testbug', # Make sure to include your app here.
    ],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'default.db',
        },
        'other': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'other.db',
        },
    },
    SECRET_KEY='reproducer-secret-key',
)

django.setup()


# Assuming fixture 'books.json' exists in the current directory
fixture_file = 'books.json'

try:
    # Attempt to load fixture into the 'other' database
    call_command('loaddata', fixture_file, database='other')

    # If no exceptions were raised, we assume the issue is fixed
    print("Data loaded successfully into the non-default database. The issue appears to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    # Print out stack trace to help diagnose the problem
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

Before running the script, make sure you have:
1. The correct app name in `INSTALLED_APPS` replaced `'testbug'` with your actual app name.
2. A valid fixture file named `books.json` in the same directory as this script or adjust the `fixture_file` variable accordingly.
3. Your Django project and environment properly set up.

This script modifies the application's Django settings at runtime, specifically the `DATABASES` configuration to ensure it matches your project's setup. It then attempts to load a predefined fixture (`books.json`) into the 'other' database. If it encounters any errors related to loading data with natural keys and foreign keys into a non-default database, it catches the exception, prints the stack trace using the provided function, and exits with a status code 1 indicating failure. On success, it prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0.
