Assuming the `testbug` application (from the original issue description) is not directly accessible due to the standalone script running outside a Django project structure or the application not being in python path, we'll have to simulate the issue more abstractly.

The revised script below still tries to reproduce the described error, but it minimizes assumptions about the project structure. It focuses on setting up a minimal Django application programmatically, including model definitions, to reproduce the issue within a single file. This addresses the error where the `testbug` module could not be found by the original reproduction script.

Please adapt the script as needed, especially the parts where models are defined or where Django settings are configured, to match your project's specifics.

```python
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models

# Dynamically configure the Django settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'default.db',
        },
        'other': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'other.db',
        },
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    ROOT_URLCONF='__main__',
)

# Define models and managers to simulate the context of the issue
class AuthorManager(models.Manager):
    def get_by_natural_key(self, name):
        return self.get(name=name)

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    objects = AuthorManager()

    def natural_key(self):
        return (self.name,)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class BookManager(models.Manager):
    def get_by_natural_key(self, title, author_name):
        return self.get(title=title, author__name=author_name)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, models.DO_NOTHING, related_name="books")
    objects = BookManager()

    def natural_key(self):
        return (self.title,) + self.author.natural_key()
    
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'
        unique_together = (('title', 'author'),)

        print("Data loaded successfully, issue seems to be fixed.")
    except Exception as e:

```

This script embeds model and manager definitions directly, sets up the Django environment, and performs operations that should trigger the described issue. However, since Django's `execute_from_command_line` does not natively support passing fixture data via STDIN in this script context, you would manually need to adapt this part to actually load the fixtures (e.g., by having a `data.json` fixture file prepared in the same directory). Adjust the `execute_from_command_line` call accordingly if you intend to directly input JSON data or use a different approach for loading the fixture.

Keep in mind, running this in a real project setting requires adapting paths (`'__main__'` might need to be replaced with your app's name in `INSTALLED_APPS` and model `Meta` classes), and you might need to provide an actual fixture file path or create models programmatically.
