The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

It supports multiple formats, including the preferred Django format (e.g., '%d %H:%M:%S.%f'), ISO 8601 duration format, and PostgreSQL's day-time interval format. The method uses regex patterns (`standard_duration_re`, `iso8601_duration_re`, and `postgres_interval_re`) to match the input string and extracts time components such as days, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds. These components are then used to construct a `timedelta` object.\n\nKey steps in the method:\n- Extracts matched groups into a dictionary (`kw`) using the regex patterns.\n- Determines the sign (`+` or `-`) of the duration.\n- Adjusts microseconds to ensure correct formatting.\n- Converts extracted string values to float where applicable.\n- Constructs two `timedelta` objects: one for days (`days = datetime.timedelta(kw.pop('days', .0) or .0)`) and another one using the rest of the components (`sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)`).\n- Returns the sum of these two `timedelta` objects.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe bug report highlights a specific problem where the sign of the duration string is ignored if the string only contains days. This issue directly relates to how the `parse_duration` method handles the construction and summation of `timedelta` objects, especially in the lines:\n\n```python\n146         days = datetime.timedelta(kw.pop('days', .0) or .0)\n147         return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)\n```\n\nWhen the duration only includes days with a negative sign, the construction logic in the method fails to properly apply the sign to the resulting `timedelta` object, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would be that if a duration string represents a negative duration consisting solely of days, the `parse_duration` method should correctly return a `timedelta` object with a negative value representing those days. This implies that the sign should correctly impact the `timedelta` representing days in the resulting calculation, not just the additional components (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.).\n\nGiven this analysis, a possible path to addressing the bug would involve adjusting the construction logic for the `timedelta` object representing days or how the sum of the `days` `timedelta` and the other components `timedelta` is calculated, to ensure the sign is consistently applied across all components of the duration."

To achieve this, the method must ensure that the effect of the sign is not lost when constructing the days component of the `datetime.timedelta` object or when combining it with other components to form the final duration.\n\nThis can be implemented by ensuring that the sign is applied directly to the `days` value before or during the construction of the `days` `timedelta` object, such that:\n\n- If the input string denotes a negative duration (e.g., `'-P1D'` for minus one day), the returned `datetime.timedelta` object should correctly reflect this by having a negative number of days.\n- The existing functionality for handling hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds remains unchanged, preserving the method's ability to parse and construct durations from strings with mixed or singular time components.\n\nThis adjustment ensures the method accurately processes ISO 8601 duration strings, aligning the function's behavior with expected standards and handling of negative durations, especially for strings that represent durations in days only."
