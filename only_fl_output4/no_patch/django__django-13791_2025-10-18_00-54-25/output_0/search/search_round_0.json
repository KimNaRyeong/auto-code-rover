        "content": "<issue>parse_duration() ISO string sign is ignored when the timedelta only has days\nDescription\nI'm pretty sure that this is a bug even though I'm not an expert on the ISO 8601 standard. The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Since the issue specifically mentions `parse_duration` method and the file location `django/utils/dateparse.py`, we should aim to gather more code context around these mentions. The following are some targeted search API calls that would assist in resolving this issue:\n\n1. Search for the `parse_duration` method within the entire codebase. This will help confirm the exact file and location of the method for further examination.\n```python\nsearch_method('parse_duration')\n```\n\n2. Get the code around the mentioned line in the `django/utils/dateparse.py` file. Although the exact line number 147 is given, we need a wider context to understand surrounding logic. A `window_size` of 10 should provide sufficient context.\n```python\nget_code_around_line('django/utils/dateparse.py', 147, 10)\n```\n\n3. Since `datetime.timedelta` is also mentioned in the context of the issue, it could be helpful to search for where `timedelta` is directly used within the `django/utils/dateparse.py` file. This is to understand how `timedelta` is constructed in different scenarios within this file.\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file('datetime.timedelta', 'django/utils/dateparse.py')\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive code context surrounding the reported issue, which would be instrumental in forming a solution."
