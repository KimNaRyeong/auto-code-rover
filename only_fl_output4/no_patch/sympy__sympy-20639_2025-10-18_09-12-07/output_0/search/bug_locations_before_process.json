        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Pow` method should correctly handle the pretty printing of expressions involving `pi` raised to any power, specifically when the exponent involves the mathematical constant `E`. The method needs to ensure that expressions like `pi**(1/E)` are rendered accurately, reflecting the correct pretty print notation for power expressions. This adaptation should acknowledge the unique handling required for mathematical constants and maintain compatibility with a wide range of other expressions currently supported by the pretty printing functionality. The fix should ensure that the output is consistent with mathematical standards and user expectations, particularly aligning with the correct symbolic representation for such expressions."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure the class `PrettyPrinter` as a whole correctly manages the rendering of mathematical constants such as `pi` and Euler's number `E` in complex expressions, not just when these appear in power expressions. This requires a holistic review and possible enhancement of how constants are handled to prevent similar bugs from occurring in different contexts. This involves ensuring that all methods within the `PrettyPrinter` class that deal with mathematical constants and their operations accurately represent them in their pretty format. It also includes a comprehensive test to confirm that these improvements work across a range of expressions involving `pi`, `E`, and other significant constants, ensuring the preservation of the library's wide-ranging functionality."
