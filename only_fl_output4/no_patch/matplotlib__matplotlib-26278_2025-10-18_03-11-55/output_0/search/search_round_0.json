        "content": "<issue>Cleaning up kwargs in ContourSet\nThis is a continuation of a mailing list thread where we talked about how to clip a plot inside a polygon. It is a very useful application for people who are visualizing data on maps since often times we want to plot everything inside one region (country, state or province).\nhttp://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Clipping-a-plot-inside-a-polygon-td41950.html\nCurrently for many types of plots this is not that hard to do using the clip_path keyword for most of the plotting functions, since the kwargs are usually used to modify properties of the artists to be generated by the plotting function. For example, suppose that I had a polygon defining the border of a country, poly, and some data to overlay on top.\n```\nplt.pcolor(data, clip_path=poly)\n```\nDoes what I want because the kwargs of pcolor let me modify the underlying PolyCollection instance. However, there are a few plotting functions where I cannot do this, most notably in contour / contourf:\n```\nplt.contourf(data, clip_path=poly)\n```\nWill work but the clip_path kwarg gets completely ignored. To get the result I want, I need to store the output of contourf and use the set_clip_path method on each collection instance:\n```\ncs = plt.contourf(data)\nfor col in cs.collections:\ncol.set_clip_path(poly)\n```\nSo I looked at the code in contour.py and realized that no kwargs get passed when instantiating the collections. @pelson mentioned that this might call for an overhaul of how the kwargs get passed into a ContourSet. His suggestion was either adding a set_clip_path method directly to ContourSet, or a more thorough change of how the kwargs are getting passed so they are more consistent with the other plotting functions. Ideally, I would prefer the latter case since then for my usage case I could always get what I want just by passing in the kwarg directly. Additionally it would make the functionality of contour(f) more similar to the other plotting functions, ie some of the kwargs can be passed to the collections. Any thoughts on this?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue concerning the handling of `kwargs` in `ContourSet` for plot clipping inside a polygon, especially for `plt.contourf`, let's proceed by gathering detailed context about relevant classes, methods, and code snippets. Specifically, we aim to understand how `kwargs` are passed and handled in `ContourSet`, compare with a similar mechanism in `pcolor`, and identify where modifications can be applied to achieve consistent `kwargs` handling, including support for `clip_path`.\n\n1. Investigate the `ContourSet` class to understand its structure and current method for handling `kwargs`.\n2. Look into the implementation of `plt.contourf` to see how it instantiates `ContourSet` and whether there's an opportunity to pass `kwargs` more effectively.\n3. For comparison, examine `plt.pcolor` to see how `kwargs` are handled and the underlying `PolyCollection` instance is modified, shedding light on consistent handling mechanisms.\n4. Based on the suggestion mentioned in the issue, check if a `set_clip_path` method exists in `ContourSet` or any relevant method that allows setting a clip path post-initialization.\n\nThe following search API calls will be made for gathering this context:\n\n- `search_class(\"ContourSet\")`: To get an overview of the `ContourSet` class.\n- `search_method(\"contourf\")`: To understand how `plt.contourf` is implemented and interacts with `ContourSet`.\n- `search_method(\"pcolor\")`: To compare with `plt.pcolor` and see how it manages `kwargs`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_clip_path\", \"ContourSet\")`: To check if the `set_clip_path` method already exists in `ContourSet` for potential direct usage or modification."
