        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, I will invoke the following API calls based on the classes, methods, and code statements mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. To understand the inheritance structure and any customizations that might be causing the crash, I need to look into the definitions of the involved classes:\n    - `search_class_in_file(\"ItalianRestaurant\", \"tests/model_inheritance/models.py\")`\n    - `search_class_in_file(\"ItalianRestaurantManyParents\", \"tests/model_inheritance/models.py\")`\n    - `search_class_in_file(\"Place\", \"tests/model_inheritance/models.py\")`\n    - `search_class_in_file(\"Supplier\", \"tests/model_inheritance/models.py\")`\n\n2. Since the crash happens during an object creation, which under the hood calls the `save()` method and subsequently `_save_parents()` which is causing the issue, I will examine these methods in the `Model` class, likely found within Django's model base file:\n    - `search_method(\"save_base\")`\n    - `search_method(\"_save_parents\")`\n\n3. Finally, since the error message refers to an `'OneToOneField' object has no attribute 'attname'`, it might be useful to understand how `OneToOneField` is defined and used in Django's ORM layer, particularly looking for how `attname` should be accessed or defined:\n    - `search_class(\"OneToOneField\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context around the definitions of involved classes, the inheritance pattern causing the crash, and the specific details of Django's handling of model saving and `OneToOneField` attribute access that are relevant to this issue."
