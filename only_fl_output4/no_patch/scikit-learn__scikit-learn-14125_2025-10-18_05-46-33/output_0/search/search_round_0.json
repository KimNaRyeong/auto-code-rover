I will use a combination of API calls to find occurrences of `SparseSeries` usage and references, and also try to identify if there's an implementation for transitioning to using a `Series` with sparse values.\n\n1. **Search the entire codebase for `SparseSeries` usage:** This will give us a broad understanding of where in the project `SparseSeries` is being referenced or used. \n\n2. **Find methods that might be creating or manipulating `SparseSeries`:** Since the issue suggests migrating to the use of `Series` with sparse values, it is crucial to identify methods that might be handling `SparseSeries` directly.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SparseSeries\")\nsearch_method(\"SparseSeries\")\n```\n\nThese calls should provide an initial overview and specific locations (methods or code snippets) where changes from `SparseSeries` to `Series` with sparse values should be applied. From there, we can evaluate the need for additional, more focused searches."
