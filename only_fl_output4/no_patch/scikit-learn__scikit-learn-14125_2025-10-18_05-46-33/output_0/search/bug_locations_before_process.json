Given the move away from SparseSeries to using Series with sparse values, the check for SparseSeries should either be removed or replaced/updated to ensure that Series with sparse values are properly supported and do not result in errors. The intended behavior should ensure that any Series (sparse or not) is accepted and correctly processed by the type_of_target function without raising errors related to its sparse nature."
