        "intended_behavior": "The `_get_view_func` method should accurately resolve and import the specified view function or class method from a string path, even when the view or method is named in mixed-case. This requires enhancing the method to handle mixed-case or case-sensitive class and method names appropriately, ensuring that it matches Python's case-sensitive nature. \n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should:\n\n- Preserve the original case of the view or method name when attempting to import it. This could involve adjusting the `get_mod_func` utility function or ensuring that the import mechanism within `_get_view_func` itself respects the case sensitivity of class and method names.\n- Ensure that if the first import attempt fails (possibly due to case sensitivity issues), it performs a more refined analysis or parsing of the view path that respects case sensitivity. This might include a secondary check where the case of the last path component (which could be a class or function name) is preserved exactly as specified in the view path argument.\n- Continue to support the existing functionality for resolving and importing views, without introducing regressions for function-based views or class-based views named in lowercase.\n\nThe enhancement to `_get_view_func` specifically aims at eliminating the discrepancy leading to a `404` error when accessing documentation for class-based views with mixed-case names through the Django admin documentation system."
