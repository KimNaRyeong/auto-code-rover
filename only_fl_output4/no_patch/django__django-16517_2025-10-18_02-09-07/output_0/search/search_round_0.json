        "content": "To properly address the issue, we need to gather information regarding how Django's admin documentation system handles view and template references, specifically focusing on the conversion or processing that may lead to the described problem where \"orders.becomes lowercase. The components mentioned in the issue revolve around a class-based view (`OrderSearch`), Django admin documentation system (`view:orders.views.Orders` directive leading to a `404 error`), and a method that might be responsible for handling view functions (`_get_view_func`). Given this information, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class where the issue is mentioned**: Since the issue occurs within Django's admin documentation system, and specifically, it's raised by `django.contrib.admindocs.views.ViewDetailView`, it's crucial to look at the `ViewDetailView` class to understand how it processes view links in documentation.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ViewDetailView\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the `_get_view_func` method**: The issue description points out a suspicion towards the `_get_view_func` method as part of the problem. To understand how this method processes the view names, we need to inspect its implementation.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_get_view_func\")\n```\n\n3. **Get the code around the mentioned URL**: Since the issue description pointed out a specific line in `views.py` belonging to Django's admin documentation (`https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/admindocs/views.py#L168`), it would be insightful to examine the context around this line to understand how the admin docs handle references to views and templates.\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", 168, 10)\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how the mentioned feature is implemented and identify potential places where the case sensitivity issue could be introduced."
