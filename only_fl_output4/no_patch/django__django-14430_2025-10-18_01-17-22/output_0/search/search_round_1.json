        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into the Django ORM's handling of aggregations, especially when encountering empty or non-matching querysets, as described in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `EmptyResultSet` class\n\nThe `EmptyResultSet` exception is found within `django/core/exceptions.py` without specific detail in the provided snippet. However, its mere location and naming suggest that this exception is raised when a query results in no matches, likely used throughout Django's ORM to signify that an expected result set is, in fact, empty. This is directly related to the issue since the bug is observed when the queryset is empty (`__in=[]`), leading to an `EmptyResultSet`.\n\n### Analysis of `Query.get_aggregation` Method\n\nThe `Query.get_aggregation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is complex and handles constructing the SQL for aggregation queries. This method checks for conditions that necessitate using a subquery for aggregation and handles the case where an aggregation should be performed on a limited and/or distinct set of results. It clearly delineates the handling of aggregation outside the normal queryset if certain conditions are met (lines 441-487). Notably, line 499-500 handles a scenario where the query's result is `None`, filling the aggregation result with `None` for each expected output. This is likely a scenario that interacts with the observed bug, as when an `EmptyResultSet` is encountered, no aggregation occurs, leading to `None` as the output rather than executing the `Coalesce` function to provide a fallback value.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps\n\nGiven the observed behavior (the aggregation returning `None` instead of executing `Coalesce` with a fallback), the `Query.get_aggregation` method seems to be a critical area. The intended behavior would be for the aggregation, especially when wrapped in `Coalesce`, to return the fallback value provided by `Value(0)` even when no records are matched by the filter.\n\nHowever, we're missing the link between the raising of `EmptyResultSet` within the lookup process and how it's caught or managed within `Query.get_aggregation`. Since we couldn't find the exact place in `lookups.py` where `EmptyResultSet` is raised with the provided search term, a closer examination of the `__in` lookup handling that leads to an `EmptyResultSet` would be necessary. This would involve:\n\n1. **Understanding the `__in` lookup process**: Since the straightforward search for the raising of `EmptyResultSet` in `lookups.py` did not yield results, exploring how Django constructs the query for an `__in` lookup, especially with an empty list, might shed light. The issue hints at the exception handling within the aggregation query process, so another approach could be to examine the `Query` class or `lookups.py` for how `__in` lookups are constructed and managed.\n\n2. **Exploring the exception handling for `EmptyResultSet`**: It would be helpful to find how `Query.get_aggregation` or related methods handle the scenario leading to an `EmptyResultSet`, potentially extending the search to how Django's ORM distinguishes between an empty result set due to no records being found and a valid but empty input list for `__in`.\n\nHence, two additional API calls could provide the missing context:\n\n- `search_method(\"build_filter\")`: To potentially find where `__in` lookups are being constructed and how they might lead to an `EmptyResultSet`.\n- `search_code(\"EmptyResultSet\")`: Diving deeper into where `EmptyResultSet` is referenced across the ORM might uncover its connection to the handling of aggregate queries."

Specifically, when encountering an empty queryset that would normally result in an `EmptyResultSet`, and therefore no real SQL query execution, the method should instead ensure that `Coalesce` functions still return their specified default values (as provided by `Value`), instead of resulting in `None`. This requires implementing logic that detects when the queryset is empty due to an `__in` lookup with an empty list, and rather than bypassing the query execution or returning a default `None` for each aggregate, it should respect `Coalesce` wrappers and return their defined fallback values. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality where actual records are matched or actual empty result sets are encountered, ensuring that the fix is targeted only at cases that would incorrectly bypass `Coalesce` due to the queryset being programmatically empty from the start."
