When an aggregate function is wrapped with 'Coalesce' and the query would traditionally lead to an 'EmptyResultSet', the system should return the 'Coalesce' default value instead of 'None'. This adjustment must preserve the functionality for all other types of queries and conditions, ensuring that it specifically addresses the case of aggregates with 'Coalesce' when facing 'EmptyResultSet' scenarios."

This would ensure that 'Coalesce' effectively provides a default value even when no rows are matched, addressing the core issue and maintaining existing functionality where applicable."
