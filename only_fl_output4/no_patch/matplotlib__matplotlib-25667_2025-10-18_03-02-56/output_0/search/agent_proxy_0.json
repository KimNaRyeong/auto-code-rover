Additionally, understanding how the `plot` method is able to correctly handle datetime objects when `bar` and `barh` do not might offer some insight.\n\nTherefore, I will perform the following API calls:\n1. Search for the method definitions of `bar` and `barh` to see how they process their parameters.\n2. Search for the method definition of `plot` to compare its handling of datetime objects with `bar` and `barh`.\n3. Look into how matplotlib handles unit conversion, particularly for datetime objects, as the working example forces a conversion that `bar` and `barh` don't.\n\nHere are the specific API calls I'm going to make:\n- search_method(\"bar\")\n- search_method(\"barh\")\n- search_method(\"plot\")\n- search_code(\"date.converter\")"
