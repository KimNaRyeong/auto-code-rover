        "intended_behavior": "The method should include additional logic to detect when the `bottom` parameter contains datetime objects. Upon detection, it should ensure that the appropriate date converter is automatically applied to the axis. This logic should integrate seamlessly with existing data type checks and conversions, preserving all current functionalities of the method. The adjustment should allow `bar` plots with datetime information on the y-axis (or x-axis for `barh`) to automatically leverage Matplotlib's date conversion mechanisms without manual intervention."

        "method": "barh",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `bar` method, `barh` needs to have an enhanced logic for automatic detection and conversion of datetime objects specified in the `left` parameter to leverage the date conversion functionality of Matplotlib. This method should also harmonize with the switchable date converter mechanism, choosing between `ConciseDateConverter` and `DateConverter` based on the runtime configuration settings (`date.converter` and `date.interval_multiples`). The update aims to ensure that horizontal bar plots (`barh`) can accurately and automatically represent datetime data on their axes."
