        "intended_behavior": "The `subs` method should correctly handle the substitution of `x` with `oo` for a wide range of expressions. The issue described suggests an inconsistency in how expressions evaluate to infinity. For `(x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)`, the correct behavior seems to be straightforward substitution resulting in `oo + cos(oo)` evaluating to `oo` since `cos(oo)` is undefined and thus should not affect the limit of the expression as `x` approaches infinity. For `(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)`, it is expected to evaluate directly to an expression that reflects the `exp(oo)` correctly tending towards infinity while taking into account that `cos(oo)` does not converge. The intended solution would involve ensuring that when expressions involving transcendental functions and infinity are evaluated, `subs` accounts for the characteristics of the mathematical functions at infinity, ensuring consistency and correctness (perhaps through more sophisticated handling or special cases for these scenarios). This might involve enhancing the method to better recognize and deal with expressions where infinity is involved, possibly leveraging existing mechanisms for representing undefined or unbounded behavior like `AccumBounds` as a fallback for non-converging functions."
