        "content": "To gather sufficient context for the issue regarding the evaluation of expressions with `.subs(x, oo)` resulting in different outputs (`oo` vs `AccumBounds`), we need to explore the relevant classes and methods that handle substitutions and evaluations of infinite values (`oo`) in expressions. Given that the issue involves symbolic mathematics, it's likely related to a symbolic computation library, such as SymPy. We need to inspect how substitutions are handled, particularly for expressions involving functions like `exp` and `cos`, and also how infinity (`oo`) is evaluated in different contexts.\n\nHere are the relevant API calls we can make to gather the needed context:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the `subs` method:\n   - `search_method(\"subs\")`\n\n2. Since the issue involves evaluating expressions at infinity (`oo`), we should also look into how infinite values are represented and managed:\n   - `search_class(\"AccumBounds\")`\n   - `search_code(\"oo\")`\n\n3. Given that specific functions (`exp`, `cos`) are involved in the issue, we'll want to understand how they are implemented and if they have any special handling for substitutions involving `oo`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"subs\", \"Function\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"Function\")`\n\n4. Understanding how `exp` and `cos` specifically behave when substituted with infinity might also require looking into any specialized implementations for these functions:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"Exp\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"Cos\")`\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary code, class, and method contexts to understand why substituting `x` with `oo` in expressions involving `exp(x) + cos(x)` returns `AccumBounds`, while `(x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` results in `oo`."
