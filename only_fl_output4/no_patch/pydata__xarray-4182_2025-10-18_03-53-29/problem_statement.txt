Pre-expand data and attributes in DataArray/Variable HTML repr?
## Proposal

Given that a major purpose for plotting an array is to look at data or attributes, I wonder if we should expand these sections by default?
- I worry that clicking on icons to expand sections may not be easy to discover
- This would also be consistent with the text repr, which shows these sections by default (the Dataset repr is already consistent by default between text and HTML already)

## Context

Currently the HTML repr for DataArray/Variable looks like this:

To see array data, you have to click on the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1217238/85610286-b7a28b80-b60b-11ea-9496-a4f9d9b048ac.png) icon:

(thanks to @max-sixty for making this a little bit more manageably sized in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/3905!)

There's also a really nice repr for nested dask arrays:
