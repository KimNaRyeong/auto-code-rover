Given your instructions, let me correct and simplify the creation of a Python script that aims to reproduce the described issue under the assumptions from your initial scenario. This involves attempting to use window functions in SQLite through a Python script to see if it results in an `OperationalError` due to the SQLite version not supporting window functions before version 3.25.0.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sqlite3
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
        c = conn.cursor()
        c.execute("CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)")
        c.execute("INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')")
        # This select with a window function might cause the OperationalError if not supported
        c.execute("SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x")
    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Verify the SQLite version
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("SELECT sqlite_version();")
        sqlite_version = cur.fetchone()[0]
        # Check if the version of SQLite is indeed lower than 3.25.0, which would explain the lack of window functions support
        if sqlite_version < "3.25.0":
            raise AssertionError("SQLite version does not support window functions. Detected version: " + sqlite_version)
        else:
            raise
    finally:
        conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        print("No issue detected. Window functions are supported in this version of SQLite.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 when the expected AssertionError is caught, indicating the issue is correctly reproduced.
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate an unexpected failure.
```

This code snippet checks for the presence of window function support by attempting to execute a SQL statement that includes a window function. In case of an `OperationalError`, it further assesses the SQLite version. If the SQLite version indeed does not support window functions, an `AssertionError` is raised with details, fulfilling the criteria of raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and aiming to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed or correctly identified.
