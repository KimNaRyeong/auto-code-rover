This Python script is designed to be a standalone file named `reproducer.py` which you can execute directly in the root directory of your project using `python3 reproducer.py`. It will try to execute a SQL query utilizing the window function `row_number()`. This will raise an `sqlite3.OperationalError` when window functions are not supported by the SQLite version bundled with the Python interpreter, due to the lack of support for window functions in SQLite versions prior to 3.25.0. This error is captured, and a detailed stack trace is printed, followed by an `AssertionError` indicating that the issue described is indeed present. The script exits with code 0 if this issue is encountered, adhering to the specific instructions for the output behavior when the issue is present.
