        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, a mechanism should be introduced within the SQLite backend, particularly in the initial setup or query execution pathways that checks the SQLite version in use. If the version is older than 3.25.0, the backend should mark window functions as unsupported. This can be done by setting a feature flag specifically for window functions within the `features` property of the backend class. Before attempting to execute a query involving window functions, the Django ORM should check this feature flag. If unsupported, a descriptive error should be raised informing the developer that their current SQLite version does not support window functions."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `annotate` method, when annotations that involve window functions are being added to a queryset, the ORM should verify if the underlying database engine (in contexts where SQLite is used) supports window functions. This could be achieved by consulting a feature flag (as described previously) indicating the availability of window functions. If the feature is unsupported, this method should raise a Django-specific exception (e.g., `FeatureNotSupportedError`) with a clear message indicating the absence of window function support in the SQLite version being used. This check would help developers understand the limitations of their current environment, rather than facing a low-level `OperationalError` from the SQLite engine."
