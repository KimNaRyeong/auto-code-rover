        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "For resolving the issue related to SQLite not supporting window functions prior to version 3.25.0 and the associated unhandled `django.db.utils.OperationalError`, we need to get context and potentially find places in the Django codebase where a version check or a feature support check for SQLite could be effectively implemented or improved. Looking at the issue description, there are a few key points to focus on:\n\n1. The place in Django where the exception is being raised (`django.db.utils.OperationalError`). This would likely be where Django handles or executes SQL queries.\n2. Investigation into how Django currently checks for database feature support, to see if there's a mechanism for checking SQLite version or if one could be introduced or extended.\n3. The actual usage of window functions within Django's ORM, particularly the `annotate` method with `Window` and `RowNumber`, to understand where the interception for a feature check could logically occur.\n\nBased on these points, the following API calls will be useful for gaining the necessary project context:\n\n1. Search for the handling or execution of SQL queries within Django, specifically where `OperationalError` is caught or raised, and potentially where database features are checked:\n   - `search_code(\"django.db.utils.OperationalError\")`\n   - `search_method(\"execute\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of window functions or the `annotate` method within Django's ORM to find where a version check might be added or is missing for SQLite:\n   - `search_class(\"Window\")`\n   - `search_class(\"RowNumber\")`\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n3. Since feature flags or compatibility checks for databases are typically centralized, it's worth investigating if there's an existing way Django checks for feature support specific to each database backend, like SQLite version checks:\n   - `search_method(\"features\")`\n   - `search_method(\"check_feature_support\")` (Hypothetical method, assuming there might be a method for checking feature support)\n\nPlease proceed with these API searches to gather the requisite context."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls, we can derive insights on components related to the issue at hand:\n\n### Analysis of `execute` Method Results\nThe `execute` method is a critical part of interacting with databases in Django, found within different database backend files (e.g., `django/db/backends/utils.py` and `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`). The existence of such methods in files tailored to specific database backends (like SQLite3) provides a pathway for implementing database-specific logic, such as version checking or feature support verification. \n\n**Connection to the Bug:** The use of window functions in SQLite versions prior to 3.25.0 leads to an `OperationalError` because these versions do not support window functions. Modifications or checks within the `execute` method implementations, especially in `sqlite3/base.py`, could preempt such errors by validating SQLite's version beforehand.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Ideally, the code would prevent executing unsupported SQL syntax based on the SQLite version being used, perhaps by raising a more descriptive error or by performing a capability check before attempting to use window functions.\n\n### Analysis of `Window` and `RowNumber` Class Results\nThe `Window` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` and the `RowNumber` class in `django/db/models/functions/window.py` are implementations that directly support window function operations in Django's ORM. These classes are foundational for using window functions in Django queries.\n\n**Connection to the Bug:** These classes are part of the ORM's higher-level abstraction for SQL operations, including window functions. However, they do not appear to include any version or feature support checks for the underlying database engine, leading to the issue reported.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** In the context of this bug, these classes or their utilization should incorporate a mechanism to verify if the underlying database (SQLite in this case) supports the features they are meant to enable. If the support is lacking, they should either prevent the operation entirely or provide a clear, actionable error message.\n\n### Analysis of `annotate` Method Results\nThe `annotate` method in `django/db/models/query.py` allows for adding extra data or aggregations to queryset objects, which can include window functions. The detailed implementation handles various nuances around annotation, aggregation, and potential conflicts with model fields.\n\n**Connection to the Bug:** The use of the `annotate` method to apply window functions without checking SQLite version compatibility is a direct cause of the issue. There's a gap where capability checks could be integrated to prevent misuse on unsupported SQLite versions.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The method could be extended or surrounded by functionality to assess if the annotations (especially, but not limited to, window functions) are compatible with the database's capabilities, thus preventing or better handling errors stemming from incompatibility.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Unsuccessful Searches\n\nOur searches for a `features` method and a hypothetical `check_feature_support` did not yield results, suggesting that these specific approaches or naming conventions might not be present in the Django codebase as is. However, most database backends in Django have a `features` attribute in their respective base classes, which contain flags indicating the support for various features.\n\nGiven this, a more targeted search toward understanding how Django manages database features, especially for SQLite, could involve:\n- Inspecting the SQLite backend (`django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`) for any feature flags or capabilities attributes.\n- Searching for documentation or implementation of feature flags in `django/db/backends/base/features.py`, which typically lists capabilities of database backends in Django.\n\n**Additional Recommended API Calls:**\n- `search_code_in_file(\"features\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"django.db.backends.base.features.py\")`\n\nThese explorations can potentially reveal how Django currently handles feature support checks and might offer a guideline on how to integrate a check for window functions support based on the SQLite version."

If the version is older than 3.25.0, the backend should mark window functions as unsupported. This can be done by setting a feature flag specifically for window functions within the `features` property of the backend class. Before attempting to execute a query involving window functions, the Django ORM should check this feature flag. If unsupported, a descriptive error should be raised informing the developer that their current SQLite version does not support window functions.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n**File:** django/db/models/query.py\n\n**Class:** QuerySet\n\n**Method:** annotate\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nIn the `annotate` method, when annotations that involve window functions are being added to a queryset, the ORM should verify if the underlying database engine (in contexts where SQLite is used) supports window functions. This could be achieved by consulting a feature flag (as described previously) indicating the availability of window functions. If the feature is unsupported, this method should raise a Django-specific exception (e.g., `FeatureNotSupportedError`) with a clear message indicating the absence of window function support in the SQLite version being used. This check would help developers understand the limitations of their current environment, rather than facing a low-level `OperationalError` from the SQLite engine."
