To reproduce the issue described, we need a script that executes a pytest test where the issue with the alteration of the test name occurs. Since the issue revolves around pytest itself, the script `reproducer.py` will generate a temporary pytest test file, execute it, and check the output for the incorrect test name format. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError`.

Here's how you can write such a script:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import tempfile

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_reproducer():
    # Define the content of a temporary test file
    test_content = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""
    # Create a temporary file
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.py', delete=False) as tmpfile:
        tmpfile_path = tmpfile.name
        tmpfile.write(test_content.encode())

    try:
        # Run pytest on the temporary test file and capture the output
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest", tmpfile_path, "-v"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        
        # Check if the output contains the altered test name
        if "test_boo[.[]" not in result.stdout:
            print("Issue not present. This is unexpected if the patch is not applied.")
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: 'test_boo[..[]' replaced with 'test_boo[.[]'")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Clean up by removing the temporary file
        os.remove(tmpfile_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_reproducer()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
```

This script does the following:
- Generates a temporary pytest test script `test_content` that will trigger the issue when run.
- Executes this script with `pytest` and captures its output.
- Checks the output for the altered test name format. If the alteration is found (`"test_boo[.[]"` instead of the expected `"test_boo[..[]"`), an `AssertionError` is raised.
- Finally, it cleans up by removing the temporary file.

Please make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`) before running this script. Also, adjust the script according to your Python environment if necessary (e.g., using `python` or `python3` command as required).
