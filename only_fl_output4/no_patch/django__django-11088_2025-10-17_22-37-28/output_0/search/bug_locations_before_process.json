This involves detecting when the field in question is a `BinaryField` and ensuring that its default value is correctly prepared as binary data. This might require conditionally converting string defaults to binary for `BinaryField` instances to preserve the expected behavior across different database operations."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_alter_field` method should incorporate logic to handle the reversal of migrations for `BinaryField` default value changes correctly. This involves ensuring that during the migration process, any changes to a `BinaryField`'s default value, especially conversions between binary and string types, are reversible without causing type errors. This might entail adding checks or conversion steps specifically for `BinaryField` when detecting a change in the field's default value that involves a transition between non-binary and binary types. The method must account for the nuances of binary data handling to ensure that migrations and their reversals are consistent and error-free."
