Therefore, we don't need to construct additional search API calls for more context.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`\n- Class: `Command`\n- Method: `handle`\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThis method needs to conditionally perform the `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` operation based on a new command-line flag provided to `makemigrations`. This means adding a new option to the command that allows users to skip database consistency checks. \n\nThe code should first check if this flag is set to true. If so, it should either skip the call to `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` or catch exceptions resulting from failed database connections and continue without terminating the process. This change allows `makemigrations` to be executed in environments where a database connection cannot be established, without negating the importance of these checks in environments where they are feasible.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: `django/db/migrations/loader.py`\n- Class: `MigrationLoader`\n- Method: Not applicable (potential modifications or usage check)\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nGiven the direct relation of the `MigrationLoader` to the `check_consistent_history` call, while no direct modification might be needed inside this class based on current understanding, it's essential to ensure that any modifications made to the usage (calling context) of `MigrationLoader` or its methods in `makemigrations.py` preserve the loader's intended functionality. Specifically, if the `check_consistent_history` method's behavior is conditional on a new flag, ensure that the `MigrationLoader` instantiation and subsequent calls in `makemigrations` are made in a way that respects this conditional logic without side effects.\n\nIn essence, modifications must ensure that skipping the consistency check does not affect the loader's ability to perform its other duties, such as loading and managing migration files. Any catch or bypass logic for `check_consistent_history` should be implemented thoughtfully to maintain the integrity of migrations management within Django."
