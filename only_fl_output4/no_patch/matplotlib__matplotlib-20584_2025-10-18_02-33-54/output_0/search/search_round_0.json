Unfortunately, I noticed that the result is much coarser than without manipulation. In fact, a simple `lc.set_segments(lc.get_segments())` has this effect. I would have expected this does nothing at all.\nMWE:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nx = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)\ny = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nZ = X ** 2 + Y ** 2\nc = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[1.0], colors=\"k\")\n# reset segments\nlc = c.collections[0]\nsegments = lc.get_segments()\nlc.set_segments(segments)\nplt.gca().set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.show()\n```\n|  ![sc1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181628/123953915-11206180-d9a8-11eb-9661-ce4363d19437.png) | ![sc2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181628/123953934-17aed900-d9a8-11eb-8a50-88c6168def93.png) |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| default | with reset segments |\nThis is with mpl 3.4.2.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `set_segments(get_segments())` making lines coarser after using `contourf`, the following API calls might provide the necessary insight:\n\n1. Identify the classes and methods involved in handling the segments of a contour plot. Since the issue mentions `lc = c.collections[0]`, where `lc` likely represents a line collection, and the methods `get_segments()` and `set_segments(segments)`, we should start by understanding these methods and their associated classes.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_segments\")\nsearch_method(\"set_segments\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue is observed with `plt.contour` which uses matplotlib, and specifically contour plots, focusing on the classes related to these plots can help. Let's identify the class that handles contour plots.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ContourSet\")\n```\n\n3. The issue might pertain to how `set_segments` modifies or reinterprets the segment data. Without knowing exactly where `set_segments` and `get_segments` are implemented, checking for their usage in contour handling classes would be helpful.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"set_segments\", \"ContourSet\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get_segments\", \"ContourSet\")\n```\n\n4. Finally, since the issue is visual and pertains to the rendering or manipulation of segments, getting context on how segments are stored, manipulated, or rendered can provide further insights. Exploring relevant code around these method implementations or use cases might uncover the underlying cause.\n\nThese API calls aim to explore the fundamental implementation and usage of `get_segments` and `set_segments` within the context of contour plotting, potentially revealing why a seemingly innocuous operation alters the plot appearance."
