Here's how you can create a `reproducer.py` Python file to automatically check for the issue and print a stack trace if the bug is present:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_latex_rendering():
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr
    
    # Try the plotting to see if the LaTeX is rendered correctly
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray(range(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=range(5)))
        name = r"$Ra_s = \mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k) / \mu M^2_\infty$"
        da.x.attrs = dict(long_name=name)
        
        # This is to forcefully generate a graphical output that we can inspect visually.
        # Note: In an automatic script, it might not be straightforward to validate visual output,
        # so we assume a hypothetical function 'is_latex_rendered' exists to programmatically verify this.
        # In actuality, you would need a more sophisticated way or manual inspection to validate this.
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        da.plot(ax=ax)
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
        
        rendered_output = fig.canvas.get_renderer()._text2path._tex_manager.get_text_width_height_descent(name, ax.xaxis.label.get_font_properties())
        
        if len(rendered_output) != 3:
            raise AssertionError("LaTeX rendering is not working as expected.")
        
        print("LaTeX rendering is working as expected.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_latex_rendering()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Exit with an error code
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        # Exit successfully if no assertion error
        sys.exit(0)
```

Please note:
1. This script assumes that the issue is that LaTeX expressions are not being rendered correctly and simulates checking this programmatically.
2. For the purpose of this script, I've used a placeholder condition (`if len(rendered_output) != 3:`) to simulate detecting the error, assuming that a successful LaTeX render alters the `rendered_output` in a way we expect. In real-life scenarios, especially with graphical outputs like LaTeX rendered on a plot, visual inspection or more sophisticated image comparison might be necessary to determine if the rendering is correct.
3. The use of `_text2path._tex_manager` is a bit of a hacky way to access internal matplotlib methods that might help in programmatically asserting if LaTeX rendering happened. However, this is not a documented feature, and its presence or behavior is not guaranteed across different versions of matplotlib; thus, it should be used with caution and potentially updated to match your specific environment or matplotlib version.
