However, based on the initial analysis and understanding of the issue, potential bug locations for subsequent investigation once more context is obtained could be:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/plot/utils.py`\n  - **Class/Method:** Potentially within methods responsible for processing or setting plot labels from `DataArray` attributes.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The code at this location should ensure that `long_name` attributes containing LaTeX expressions are correctly passed to matplotlib's plotting functions without unintended alteration. If any preprocessing of `long_name` attributes occurs, it should preserve LaTeX markup for correct interpretation and rendering by matplotlib. This might include ensuring the label strings are interpreted as raw strings (e.g., prefixed with `r` in Python) or directly passing the LaTeX expressions without modification.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **Class:** `_PlotMethods` (Location to be determined after further investigation)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If the issue traces back to how `_PlotMethods` accessor routes or processes plot labels, ensuring that attributes like `long_name` are handled in a manner that respects LaTeX formatting is necessary. This could involve modifying the method(s) responsible for delegating label setting to incorporate better recognition and handling of LaTeX expressions.\n\nThese locations and intended modifications are based on the initial analysis and will need refinement once more detailed information is available from the additional context requested."
