        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `fps` function in `sympy/series/formal.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `fps` function in `sympy/series/formal.py` generates a Formal Power Series (`FormalPowerSeries` object) of a given function `f` with respect to a symbol `x` around a point `x0`. The function supports various configurations through its parameters which affect the computation of the series, like direction (`dir`), use of hypergeometric or rational algorithms (`hyper`, `rational`), and the extent of computation (`full`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The relation is direct. The issue arises when this `fps` function does not return an instance of `FormalPowerSeries` for a function that is already a polynomial (`x ** 2` in the issue description). The code shows that under certain conditions (for example, when `compute_fps` returns `None`), the `fps` function just returns the original function `f` instead of a `FormalPowerSeries` object. This is exactly what happens in the scenario described in the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, even if the input function is a simple polynomial and doesn't necessarily require formal power series expansion, the `fps` function should return a `FormalPowerSeries` object for consistency. This would ensure that the returned object supports the expected interface, such as indexing and other operations specific to `FormalPowerSeries`.\n\n#### `FormalPowerSeries` class in `sympy/series/formal.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `FormalPowerSeries` class represents a formal power series. It has various properties related to the series (like `function`, `x`, `x0`, `dir`) and methods to manipulate or inquire the series (`polynomial`, `truncate`, integration, differentiation, arithmetic operations, etc.).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `FormalPowerSeries` class is the expected return type of the `fps` function for a given function. The issue at hand is caused by the absence of this expected behavior, showing the critical role this class plays in the usage of `fps`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to ensure that for any input, unless the input is invalid or inherently unsuited for a formal power series representation, `fps` should return an instance of `FormalPowerSeries`. This would imply either adjusting the `fps` function's decision logic to default to wrapping any input `f` into a `FormalPowerSeries` object or providing a clear explanation in the documentation when it defaults to a simpler representation and how users should handle such cases.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the solution requires modifying the logic within the `fps` function in `sympy/series/formal.py` to ensure it returns a `FormalPowerSeries` object for polynomials, where it makes sense, or possibly enhancing the documentation to clarify the current behaviour and its rationale. The focus should be on why `compute_fps` might return `None` and how to handle this case by still returning a `FormalPowerSeries` object."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The issue and its potential solutions can be directly addressed with the information already collected.\n\n2. **Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors:**\n\n   - **Location 1:** File: `sympy/series/formal.py`, Method: `fps`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `fps` method to ensure that it always returns an instance of `FormalPowerSeries`, even when the input function is a simple polynomial that does not usually require an expansion to be represented as a formal power series. One way to achieve this is by modifying the logic that decides when to directly return the input function `f`. Instead, in cases where it would normally return `f` directly (for instance, when `compute_fps` returns `None`), it should instead construct a minimal `FormalPowerSeries` object that effectively represents `f` but adheres to the `FormalPowerSeries` interface. This change will allow users to consistently work with the return value of `fps` as a `FormalPowerSeries` object, using indexing and other operations without encountering type errors. Care should be taken to document this behavior clearly, indicating that even simple polynomials will be wrapped in a `FormalPowerSeries` object to maintain interface consistency. Additionally, performance implications should be considered and mitigated if possible, ensuring that this change does not introduce significant overhead for cases where it's not strictly necessary to represent the result as a formal power series.\n\nThis resolution strategy should maintain the existing functionality for all current use cases while ensuring consistency in the return type of the `fps` function across all inputs, resolving the reported issue."
