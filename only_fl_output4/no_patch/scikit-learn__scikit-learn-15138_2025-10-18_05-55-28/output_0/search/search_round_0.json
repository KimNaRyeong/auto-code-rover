        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, I need to gather more context about where and how the stacking functionality is implemented in the project. Based on the description, it seems we are dealing with a machine learning framework or library similar to `mlxtend` that implements a Stacking Classifier. The new feature request is to add an option to include the original dataset features along with the predictions of the base estimators for the final estimator training. \n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for the class that implements the stacking functionality:\n\n1. `search_class(class_name: \"StackingClassifier\")`\n\nThis will help identify the main class that needs to be modified. \n\nNext, it's crucial to understand how the final estimator is currently being trained, so I need to locate the method responsible for this training process within the `StackingClassifier`:\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"fit\", class_name: \"StackingClassifier\")`\n\nLastly, since the issue suggests a feature toggle (boolean parameter) to switch between using only the predictions and using predictions with the original features, I'll check if there's an existing parameter handling mechanism in the `fit` method or elsewhere relevant:\n\n3. `search_code_in_file(code_str: \"use_features_in_secondary\", file_path: \"path/to/StackingClassifier\")`\n\nThe file path is a placeholder for now, as the actual path will be determined based on the first search result. This step is speculative since it's based on the functionality described in the issue, which references an external library (`mlxtend`), but it's an educated guess about what to look for in the codebase."
