Given the feedback indicating that the initial reproducer did not effectively manifest the reported issue and considering the specific request for behavior surrounding `cla()` not unsetting the `.axes` attribute of deparented artists, I am providing a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This version is designed to more accurately test and demonstrate the issue as described, specifically targeting the clearing of axes with `cla()` and verifying whether it correctly unsets the `.axes` attribute on artists.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_clearing_axes_should_unset_artist_attributes():
    try:
        # Create a plot and add a line artist to the axes
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        line, = ax.plot([1, 2], label='Test Line')
        
        # Remove the line using `remove()` and check if axes is unset
        line.remove()
        assert line.axes is None, "AssertionError: `.axes` is not None after `remove()`."
        
        # Create another plot and add a line artist
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        line, = ax.plot([1, 2], label='Test Line Again')
        
        # Clear the axes using `cla()` and check if the line's `.axes` attribute is unset
        ax.cla()
        assert line.axes is None, "AssertionError: `.axes` is not None after `cla()`."
        
        # If both assertions pass, the issue is fixed
        print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero code to indicate failure/test case reproduced the issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_clearing_axes_should_unset_artist_attributes()
```

This revised script includes a more direct approach to reproducing the issue. It explicitly tests the condition where calling `cla()` should unset the `.axes` and potentially `.figure` attributes of artists that were previously attached to those axes. An `AssertionError` is raised, accompanied by a stack trace if the condition is not met, thereby providing clear insight into whether the issue persists or has been addressed.
