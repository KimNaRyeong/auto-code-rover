Can't convert a list of Astropy tables to a NumPy array of tables
I recently stumbled upon [a StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69414829/convert-a-list-of-astropy-table-in-a-numpy-array-of-astropy-table) where someone likes to convert a list of Tables to a NumPy array.
By default, NumPy will convert the Table along the way, resulting in the wrong data structure. 
Using a specific `dtype=object`, however, fails with 
```
ValueError: Datatype coercion is not allowed
```

This error leads directly to the source of `table.__array__()`, which explicitly checks for any `dtype` to be not `None`, which will raise the error.
The reasoning behind that is clear, as given in the comments below. 

But I wonder if an exception is reasonable for `dtype=object` here, and let that pass through. For a single Table, this may be odd, but not necessarily incorrect. And for a list of Tables, to be converted to an array, this may be helpful.
