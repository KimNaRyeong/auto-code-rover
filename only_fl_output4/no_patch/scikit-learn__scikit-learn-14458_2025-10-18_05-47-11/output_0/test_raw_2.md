Below is a revised standalone Python script designed to reproduce the specified issue and integrate the provided function for printing stack traces. This revised approach ensures that it attempts to showcase the problem mentioned (ndarray not being C-contiguous), raises an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, and exits with code 0 if the problem is resolved. 

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Fetch a dataset
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

        # Attempt to use Ridge regression model with 'sag' solver
        model = Ridge(solver='sag')

        # Focus on the numerical columns specified
        X_selected = X[numerical_cols]

        # Trying to identify if the issue is present by fitting the model
        # This will raise an exception if the input data array is not C-contiguous
        model.fit(X_selected, y)

    except Exception as e:
        # Print the formatted stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with an AssertionError to signal that the issue is encountered
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e
    else:
        # If no exception is raised, the issue is considered fixed
        print("Issue seems to be fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script `reproducer.py`, is structured to be executed from the root directory of a project using Python 3 with the command `python3 reproducer.py`. When running it:
- It catches and prints a detailed account of the exception if the issue about non-C-contiguous arrays is encountered, leveraging `print_stacktrace` for clarity.
- If the script runs successfully without encountering the specific exception, it will acknowledge that the issue appears resolved and exit with code 0.
