Given the misunderstanding in the previous response, let's address the actual issue described: reproducing a problem with the Ridge model from scikit-learn where an ndarray not being C-contiguous leads to a ValueError. We'll write a correct `reproducer.py` script to demonstrate the error and apply the provided function to print the stack trace for clarity.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

        model = Ridge(solver='sag')

        # Extract numerical columns without converting to numpy array explicitly.
        # pandas DataFrame selection of columns results not C-contiguous array by default.
        X_selected = X[numerical_cols]
        
        # This attempt will raise ValueError if the issue is present.
        model.fit(X_selected, y)

        # If the above line of code did not fail, we assume the issue is fixed.
        print("Issue seems to be fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising an AssertionError to indicate that the issue is still present
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks for the specific problem where a `ValueError` is raised due to the input data array not being C-contiguous. When running this script:

- If the issue is present, it will print the traceback of the exception and exit by raising an `AssertionError`.
- If the code runs successfully without raising an exception (which represents the scenario where the issue has been addressed), it will print a message indicating the issue seems to be fixed and exit with code 0.
