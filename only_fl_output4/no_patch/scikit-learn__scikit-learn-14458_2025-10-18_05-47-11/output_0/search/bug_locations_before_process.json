        "intended_behavior": "Before calling `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32`, the code should ensure the `X` array is C-contiguous. The existing functionality of handling data for model training remains as intended, with the added step of checking (and if necessary converting) the array to be C-contiguous. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `X` is C-contiguous using `numpy.ndarray.flags['C_CONTIGUOUS']`. If `X` is not C-contiguous, it can be made so using `numpy.ascontiguousarray(X)` before proceeding to instantiate `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32`. This ensures that when `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32` accesses the data, it meets the requirement of being C-contiguous, thus preventing the `ValueError` mentioned in the issue report."
