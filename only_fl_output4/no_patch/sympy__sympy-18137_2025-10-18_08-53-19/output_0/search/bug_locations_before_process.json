        "intended_behavior": "The `_contains` method must be able to handle symbolic expressions more robustly. When dealing with symbols that represent integer values but whose exact values are not determined, the method should not attempt boolean evaluations that lead to exceptions. Instead, it should return a symbolic value representing the condition under which the symbol is contained in the range. This way, the method will preserve its existing functionality of returning True, False, or a symbolic expression depending on whether a definitive containment determination can be made."

        "intended_behavior": "While the current behavior of not allowing a direct evaluation to a boolean is important to avoid incorrect simplifications, an improvement in how the `Range` and `Intersection` classes handle symbolic relations can mitigate the need for relational expressions to be directly evaluated to a boolean. Thus, this location may not need a change in itself but rather adjustments in how other parts of the SymPy library invoke or rely on the boolean coercion of `Relational` objects."
