It appears there has been a misunderstanding in interpreting the provided directions. Given the context that the previous attempt did not correctly follow your instructions about the script's behavior, here is another attempt at providing a Python script according to your specifications:

```python
from sympy import Range, FiniteSet, Symbol, symbols
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
    try:
        Range(1).intersect(FiniteSet(n))
        assert False, "The expected issue did not occur."
    except TypeError as e:
        # Check for the specific TypeError we're looking for.
        if "cannot determine truth value of Relational" in str(e):
            print("The expected issue occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            print("An unexpected TypeError occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "An unexpected issue occurred."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the issue is reproduced as expected.
    print("Issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(1)  # If the issue is fixed, exit with code 1.
```

This version of the script will catch the `TypeError` raised when attempting the intersection of a `Range` and a `FiniteSet` containing a symbolic variable and confirms if it is the specific issue related to "cannot determine truth value of Relational". If the issue occurs, it uses the provided function `print_stacktrace` to print the stack trace of the exception. It exits with code 0 if the assertion fails due to the issue being present and prints "Issue is fixed" followed by an exit code of 1 if the script encounters no errors, indicating the issue is resolved.
