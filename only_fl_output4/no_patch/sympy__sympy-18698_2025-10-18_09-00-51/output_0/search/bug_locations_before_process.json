        "intended_behavior": "The `sqf_list` method is expected to correctly calculate and return the square-free factorization of a polynomial, with each factor paired with its correct multiplicity. The issue points out an inconsistency in handling multiplicities correctly. Specifically, for a polynomial expression like `(x**2 + 1) * (x - 1)**2 * (x - 2)**3 * (x - 3)**3`, `sqf_list` is expected to list each factor with its respective multiplicity correctly without unnecessarily splitting factors into multiple entries or misrepresenting their exponents. The intended behavior should ensure that factors are consolidated properly, and their multiplicities are represented accurately, preserving existing functionality for other polynomial inputs while correcting the representation for cases highlighted in the issue."
