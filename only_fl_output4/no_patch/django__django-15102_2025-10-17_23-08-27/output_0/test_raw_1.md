Given your requirements and the encountered error, a revised approach is necessary. The initial attempt failed because the environment couldn't locate the `django-admin` command, which is crucial for the script's operation. This often happens when Django is not installed in the system's PATH or when the environment where Django is installed is not activated properly in a subprocess initiated from Python.

To ensure that the Python environment used for running the script can locate and invoke `django-admin`, one strategy is to use Django's internal functions directly within the script rather than calling `django-admin` via a subprocess. This will circumvent the PATH issue and allow the script to work in environments where Django is installed but `django-admin` might not be directly callable from the system shell.

This revised script will directly utilize Django's command execution capabilities to create a new project programmatically. It simulates the core of what `django-admin.py startproject` does but within the Python environment itself.

Here's the revised version with inline comments explaining each part:

```python
import os
import stat
import sys
from django.core.management import call_command

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def set_umask_and_check_file():
    original_umask = os.umask(0o077)
    test_dir = "testsite"
    test_file = os.path.join(test_dir, "settings.py")

    try:
        # Ensuring the directory is removed before the test begins
        if os.path.exists(test_dir):
            os.system(f'rm -rf {test_dir}')
        
        # Programmatically call Django's startproject command
        call_command('startproject', test_dir)

        if not os.path.exists(test_file):
            raise AssertionError("Settings file was not created.")

        # Check file permissions
        stat_result = os.stat(test_file)
        file_permissions = stat.S_IMODE(stat_result.st_mode)
        expected_permissions = 0o700  # Due to umask 077

        if file_permissions & expected_permissions != expected_permissions:
            raise AssertionError(f"File permissions for {test_file} do not respect umask. Found: {oct(file_permissions)}, Expected: {oct(expected_permissions)}")
        
        print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    finally:
        os.umask(original_umask)
        if os.path.exists(test_dir):
            os.system(f'rm -rf {test_dir}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Django setup
    import django
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings') # Adjust as necessary
    django.setup()
    set_umask_and_check_file()
```

### Important Notes:

1. **Django Project Dependency**: This script assumes the presence of a Django project or at least a Django environment. It imports Django's internal functions, which necessitates Django being installed in the environment where this script runs.
   
2. **Environment Variable**: The script sets `'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'` to `'your_project_name.settings'`. You need to replace `'your_project_name'` with the name of your actual Django project settings module if this script runs outside a standard Django project structure. If this script is intended to be more generic or self-contained, additional adjustments or setup might be required to mock or create a minimal Django environment runtime.

3. **Django Setup**: The call to `django.setup()` is crucial for setting up the Django environment programmatically. It ensures that Django's components are ready for use which is necessary for commands like `startproject` to function properly within the script.

4. **Security Warning**: The use of `os.system` for removing directories is generally discouraged due to potential security implications. It's used here for simplicity and should be fine for controlled environments, but consider using more secure methods (`shutil.rmtree`, for example) for real-world applications.
