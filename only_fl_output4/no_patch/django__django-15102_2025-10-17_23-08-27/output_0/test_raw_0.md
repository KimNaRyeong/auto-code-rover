To create a reproducer script for the described issue, consider the following steps in the script `reproducer.py`:

1. Set the current umask to `077` to ensure newly created files are not readable, writable, or executable by group or others.
2. Use Python's subprocess module to replicate the commands executed in the issue: First, using `touch` to create a file and check its permissions, and then simulating the Django `startproject` command to create a new project and observe the permissions of `settings.py`.
3. Since the script is meant to simulate the issue related to the `django-admin.py startproject` command, it's important to take into account that setting up a full Django environment within the script might not be straightforward. This script instead focuses on the essence of the issue: file permissions against the user's umask settings.
4. Capture if the permissions of the `settings.py` file (or any file created in a similar manner) respect the umask or if they are set to a more permissive setting, which should not happen according to the umask.

This script assumes:

- You have a Django project or at least Django installed in your environment.
- Python 3 is being used.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import stat
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def set_umask_and_check_file():
    original_umask = os.umask(0o077)
    try:
        test_dir = "testsite"
        test_file = os.path.join(test_dir, "settings.py")

        # Ensuring the directory is removed before the test begins
        if os.path.exists(test_dir):
            subprocess.check_call(['rm', '-rf', test_dir])
        
        # Attempt to create a new Django project, which should include settings.py
        subprocess.check_call(['django-admin', 'startproject', test_dir])
        
        if not os.path.exists(test_file):
            raise AssertionError("Settings file was not created.")

        # Check file permissions
        stat_result = os.stat(test_file)
        file_permissions = stat.S_IMODE(stat_result.st_mode)
        expected_permissions = 0o700  # Expected due to umask 077

        if file_permissions & expected_permissions != expected_permissions:
            raise AssertionError(f"File permissions for {test_file} do not respect umask. Found: {oct(file_permissions)}, Expected: {oct(expected_permissions)}")
        
        print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Make sure to reset the original umask
        os.umask(original_umask)
        sys.exit(1)

    finally:
        os.umask(original_umask)
        if os.path.exists(test_dir):
            subprocess.check_call(['rm', '-rf', test_dir])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_umask_and_check_file()
```

Note:

- This script creates and deletes a Django project directory (`testsite`) to test the issue. Ensure to run this in a suitable environment where this operation is safe.
- It attempts to capture and assert the core issue: whether the file permissions of newly created files by Django's `startproject` ignore the current umask settings.
- The script exits with code 0 if the issue is not present, indicating that the `settings.py` file's permissions align with the expected umask-applied permissions, and exits with code 1 if the issue is detected or if an unexpected error occurs.
