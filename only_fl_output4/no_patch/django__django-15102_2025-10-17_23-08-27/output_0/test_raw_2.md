Given the specifics of the issue you've described, we need a standalone script that directly engages with Django's `startproject` command functionality, capturing its behavior with respect to file permissions and umask settings, then verify if the permissions are correctly applied according to the user's umask. This can be somewhat tricky, because ensuring a direct interaction with the Django command line utilities without going outside the bounds of Django's own mechanisms requires emulating what the Django `startproject` command does, but subject to Python's process and file handling capabilities.

The following script (**reproducer.py**) is an attempt to directly reproduce the issue within Django's framework using Python. This script skips the Django command line tooling and goes straight to the mechanism that creates the new project files, respecting the current umask settings.

```python
import os
import sys
import stat

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_startproject_honors_umask():
    # Setting the umask to 0o077 so that all newly created files 
    # should have at most 'rwx------' permissions
    original_umask = os.umask(0o077)

    try:
        project_name = "test_project"
        # Use Django's internal mechanism to create files, simulating the startproject command
        # Since using Django internals requires Django set up, ensure Django is available:
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command("startproject", project_name)

        # The settings.py file is a good test case for checking permissions
        settings_path = os.path.join(project_name, "settings.py")
        if not os.path.exists(settings_path):
            raise AssertionError("Failed to create settings.py, startproject might not have worked as expected.")

        # Check permissions of the file, expecting them to respect the umask
        stat_result = os.stat(settings_path)
        file_permissions = oct(stat_result.st_mode)[-3:]
        
        # Expect permissions to be '-rw-------' or similar, since umask is 0o077
        # This checks for '600' permission, as Python's os module deals with permissions in octal format
        if file_permissions != '600':
            raise AssertionError(f"settings.py permissions do not honor umask 077. Permissions are: {file_permissions}")

        print("Test passed: startproject honors umask.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        os.umask(original_umask)  # Restore original umask
        if os.path.exists(project_name):
            # Clean up - remove the created project directory after checking
            import shutil
            shutil.rmtree(project_name)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_startproject_honors_umask()
```

### Note: 
This script is relying on having a Django environment properly configured and Django installed. It should be run within an environment where Django's commands (`django-admin` and/or `manage.py`) and functionalities are available, typically meaning that Django needs to be installed in the Python environment where this script is executed.

The script dynamically sets the umask, invokes Django's project creation command, then checks the permissions of the `settings.py` file in the created project to ensure they respect the configured umask. Should the permissions not match expectations set by the umask, it raises an assertion error, signaling the issue is present.
