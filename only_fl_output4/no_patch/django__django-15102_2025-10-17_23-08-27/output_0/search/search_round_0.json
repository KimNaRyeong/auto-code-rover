This means that the user's umask doesn't work, e.g.:\n$ umask 077\n$ touch foo\n$ ls -l foo\n-rw------- 1 talex talex 0 2007-05-12 13:27 foo\n$ PYTHONPATH=trunk ./trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py startproject mysite\n$ ls -l mysite/settings.py\n-rw-r--r-- 1 talex talex 2804 2007-05-12 13:28 mysite/settings.py\nI discovered this whilst trying to make a Zero Install package for Django. Everything in the Zero Install cache is read-only, so startproject fails with:\nFile \"/var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=262c95b5a7cc34f525408b675106e4e4ae3494cc/django/core/management.py\", line 799, in startproject\nfp = open(main_settings_file, 'w')\nIOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../site/settings.py'\nThanks,\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more information about the following:\n- The `startproject` command implementation to understand how file permissions are being handled currently.\n- Any usage or handling of `umask` in the project creation flow to see if and how the user's `umask` settings are being considered.\n\nGiven these requirements, here are the appropriate API calls:\n\n1. To locate where the `startproject` command is implemented:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"startproject\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions `manage.py` and setting file permissions, getting context on how files (like `settings.py`) are created during the project setup might provide insights on where the permission settings are applied:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"open\")\nsearch_code(\"os.chmod\")\n```\n\n3. The error mentioned in the issue occurs when trying to write to `settings.py`, suggesting that the file creation part of `startproject` might not respect `umask`. Therefore, pinpointing the exact location where `settings.py` is being written to could help:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"settings.py\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of where changes might need to be made to ensure `startproject` respects the user's `umask`."
