        "intended_behavior": "The code should: Create files with permissions that are initially broad or set to a reasonable default. Apply the current `umask` to these permissions before finalizing the file creation, ensuring that the effective permissions are correctly restricted based on the user's environment. This might involve capturing the `umask` at the start of the `startproject` command execution and applying it explicitly to each file created. Preserve existing functionality by still ensuring files like `manage.py` are executable and other files have appropriate read/write permissions as required, while respecting `umask` settings."
