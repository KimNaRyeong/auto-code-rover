Given the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in how the test executed and its outcome. For a more precise effort at reproducing the issue focused on the environment's readiness to use Flask, a modified approach will include steps ensuring the Flask package is installed within the environment the script is executed. However, managing package installations dynamically inside the reproducible script can lead to practices against common deployment and testing strategies, where dependencies are ideally managed outside the execution of individual scripts.

Assuming Flask is already installed in the environment where this script will run, we're focusing strictly on reproducing the issue without attempting to manage Flask installation dynamically within the script. Here's an amended version:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from flask import Flask, Blueprint

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config["SERVER_NAME"] = "localhost:5000"

    parent = Blueprint("parent", __name__, subdomain="api")
    child = Blueprint("child", __name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return "Index"

    @parent.route('/')
    def parent_index():
        return "Parent"

    @child.route('/child/')
    def child_index():
        return "Child"

    parent.register_blueprint(child)
    app.register_blueprint(parent)

    with app.test_client() as client:
        # Testing access to the parent index with subdomain
        response = client.get('/', base_url='http://api.localhost:5000')
        assert response.status_code == 200 and response.data.decode() == "Parent", "Parent index test failed"

        # Testing access to the child route with subdomain
        try:
            response = client.get('/child/', base_url='http://api.localhost:5000')
            assert response.status_code == 200 and response.data.decode() == "Child", "Child route test failed"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 indicating failure

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    print("No issues detected, the script exited with code 0 indicating success.")
```

Please ensure the Flask library is installed and available in your Python environment before running this script:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

This script will print "No issues detected, the script exited with code 0 indicating success." if it does not encounter the problem described. If the nested child blueprint is not accessible when mounted with a subdomain, it will raise an `AssertionError`, and the `print_stacktrace` function will print the stack trace of the issue.
