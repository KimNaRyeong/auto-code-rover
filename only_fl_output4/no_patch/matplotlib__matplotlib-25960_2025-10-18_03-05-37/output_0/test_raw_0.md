        # the subfigure layout params will not change from their default values.
        # Note: This might need adjustments based on the actual implementational fix.

This script assumes the issue is present when `wspace` and `hspace` settings do not affect the subfigure layout as expected. The checker for this issue uses an assertion based on the expectation that the layout parameters should change from some default values, which might need adjustment based on how this part of matplotlib's functionality works or is documented at the time of the fix. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, printing a stack trace that includes line numbers and code context.
