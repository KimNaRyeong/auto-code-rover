        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `formfield` method to ensure that the queryset used to generate form field choices applies a `distinct()` filter when `limit_choices_to` is set, especially when it involves `Q` objects with join operations. This change should ensure that, even when complex queries are used for limiting choices, the result set will contain unique options only. It's vital to ensure that this modification does not break existing functionality for `ForeignKey` fields that do not involve complex `limit_choices_to` usages or do not lead to duplicate options. This might involve carefully checking if the queryset's `distinct()` call is conditionally applied only when necessary, such as when detecting that a join operation is part of the query."
