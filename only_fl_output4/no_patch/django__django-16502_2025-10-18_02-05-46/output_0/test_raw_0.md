Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`, designed to reproduce the issue specified. This script assumes that you have an existing Django project setup as described in the issue. If not, please follow the steps in the issue description to create a new Django project before running this script.

```python
import subprocess
import threading
import http.client
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def start_django_runserver():
    """Starts the Django development server in a separate thread"""
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "django_test.settings")
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'runserver'])

def make_head_request():
    """Makes an HTTP HEAD request to the Django development server and checks the response"""
    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("127.0.0.1", 8000)
    conn.request("HEAD", "/")
    response = conn.getresponse()
    headers = response.getheaders()
    body = response.read()
    if body:
        raise AssertionError("Body should not be present for an HTTP HEAD request")

def main():
    # Start the Django development server in a separate thread
    thread = threading.Thread(target=start_django_runserver, args=())
    thread.daemon = True
    thread.start()

    # Wait for the server to start
    print("Waiting for Django server to start...")
    subprocess.run(["sleep", "3"])  # simple way to wait for the server to be likely up

    try:
        # Make the HEAD request to the server
        make_head_request()
        print("Issue not present, exited with 0.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # exit with error code when issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following actions:
1. Starts the Django server by importing and calling the `execute_from_command_line` function from Django's `management` module in a thread. This allows the script to continue executing while the server is running.
2. Waits a few seconds to ensure the Django server is up and running.
3. Performs an HTTP HEAD request to the server's root.
4. Checks if the response contains a body. According to RFC 2616, section 4.3, the response to a HEAD request must not contain a body.
5. If a body is present in the response, an `AssertionError` is raised, and the script prints the stack trace. This indicates that the issue is present.
6. If no body is found, it prints a message stating that the issue is not present and exits with code `0`.

Before running this script, please ensure that:
- A Django project is set up as mentioned in the issue description.
- The Django server can be started from the script path, i.e., the script is placed in the root directory of your Django project.
- You have Django installed in your environment within the specified version range (>1.10, <1.11).
