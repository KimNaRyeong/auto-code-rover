        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `__eq__` method in the `Model` class is to return `NotImplemented` when the object it's being compared to is not an instance of a Django Model. This change allows Python's comparison mechanisms to correctly handle or delegate the equality check, adhering to Python\u2019s comparison protocols and resolving issues with incorrect comparison outcomes.\n\nSpecifically, the method should be modified as follows:\n\n- If the `other` object is not an instance of `Model`, return `NotImplemented` instead of `False`.\n- Maintain the subsequent checks as-is: if `other` is a `Model` instance, then proceed with the existing logic to check if they belong to the same concrete model and have the same primary key, or if they are the same instance (when the primary key is `None`).\n\nThis adjustment will ensure that the `Model` class's `__eq__` method behaves correctly in all scenarios by leveraging Python's built-in mechanism for handling comparisons between differing types, thus preserving the existing functionality while also fixing the reported issue."
