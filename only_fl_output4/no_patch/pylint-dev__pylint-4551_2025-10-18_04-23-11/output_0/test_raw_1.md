Given the updated instructions and focusing specifically on reproducing the issue in a manner that raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, we'll adjust the script accordingly. This time, we'll include a mechanism to programmatically verify that `pyreverse` does not generate the expected output due to the issue with type hints. Given the inability to execute `pyreverse` directly in the previous attempt, the approach must be reconsidered.

Since the original issue involves `pyreverse` not recognizing type hints correctly, and based on the error indicating `pyreverse` was not found, an essential part of the setup will be ensuring that `pyreverse` is a part of the environment where the script is run.

However, given the error received, if direct execution of `pyreverse` is not feasible or `pyreverse` is not installed, addressing that directly in the script falls outside typical usage patterns. The script below assumes that `pyreverse` is correctly installed and accessible in the environment where this script is executed.

For a hypothetical or educational scenario where we could programmatically inspect the output for `pyreverse` within Python (assuming `pyreverse` output could be parsed in a way that's meaningful, like checking the `.dot` files it can generate instead of PNG images), here's a script approach:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_pyreverse_output_for_type_hints():
    # The test class to be analyzed by pyreverse
    class_definition = '''\"\"\"
class C(object):
    def __init__(self, a: str = None):
        self.a = a
\"\"\"
'''
    with open("test_class.py", "w") as test_file:
        test_file.write(class_definition)

    # Ensure pyreverse is available
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(["pyreverse", "-o", "dot", "-p", "test_class", "test_class.py"])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to execute pyreverse. Ensure it is installed and available in your PATH.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("pyreverse command not found. Please install pylint to use pyreverse.")
        exit(1)

    # Checking .dot file for type hints
    try:
        with open("classes_test_class.dot", "r") as dot_file:
            content = dot_file.read()
            assert 'a : str' in content, "Type hint for 'a: str = None' not properly reflected in the UML diagram."
            print("Type hint is properly reflected in the UML diagram as expected.")
            exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_pyreverse_output_for_type_hints()
```

### Note:

- The script above generates `.dot` files using `pyreverse` for easier textual analysis, assuming this method might be more direct for verifying the presence of type annotations.
- This script assumes you have `pylint` installed since `pyreverse` comes with `pylint`. If not, you need to install it using `pip install pylint` or ensure it's installed in your environment.
- The error handling for `FileNotFoundError` ensures that the script provides a clear message if `pyreverse` is missing.
- Realistically, manual verification (or using other tools designed for parsing the actual content of UML diagrams or `.dot` files) might be required for complex verification beyond simple string presence checks.
