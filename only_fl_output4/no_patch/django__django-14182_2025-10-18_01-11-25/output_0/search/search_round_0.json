If you need to round to a more specific precision you need to roll out your own solution.\nBut as far as I can tell, all backends natively supported by Django support a second argument to Round:\nPostgres: \u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-math.html#FUNCTIONS-MATH-FUNC-TABLE\nSqlite: \u200bhttps://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#round\nMySQL: \u200bhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mathematical-functions.html#function_round\nOracle: \u200bhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions135.htm\nIn my project (postgres only) my work around was to declare my own custom function:\nclass Round(Func):\nfunction = 'ROUND'\narity = 2\nBut having this built-in would be quite useful.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get started with the task of adding support for the precision argument to the `Round` function, we need to gather some context around how the `Round` function is implemented and used across the Django project. Given the nature of the issue, it seems most relevant to look at the actual implementation of the `Round` class if it exists, and any usage of `ROUND` within SQL-related code, possibly in database functions or expressions. \n\nBased on the details provided in the issue, I would start with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Round` class to understand its current implementation:\n   - `search_class(\"Round\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the implementation of a custom solution for PostgreSQL and the desire to have built-in support which works across different databases, it's relevant to find where database-related functions, specifically those tied to mathematical operations or expressions, are implemented or used:\n   - `search_code(\"Func\")`\n   - `search_code(\"ROUND\")`\n\nThese calls aim to give an overview of:\n- The current implementation of the `Round` class and its properties such as `function` and `arity`.\n- How Django defines and uses SQL functions through its ORM layer, specifically looking for existing usages of `Func` and `ROUND`.\n\nThis gathered information will be instrumental in crafting the patch to add precision argument support to the `Round` function, ensuring compatibility across the supported database backends (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle)."
