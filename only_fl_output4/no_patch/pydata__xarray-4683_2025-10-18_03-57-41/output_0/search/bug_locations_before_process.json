The method must allow the user to specify the memory layout order of operations while maintaining current functionality. As with the 'Variable' class, the addition should pass the 'order' parameter to the underlying handling (likely through 'duck_array_ops.astype' or similar), ensuring compatibility with numpy's array handling and maintaining existing features such as 'keep_attrs'."
