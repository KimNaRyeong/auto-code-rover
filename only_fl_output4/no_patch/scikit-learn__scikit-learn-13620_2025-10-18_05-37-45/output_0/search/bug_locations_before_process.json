        "intended_behavior": "The method `feature_importances_` within `BaseGradientBoosting` should ensure that feature importances calculated from the ensemble of trees sum up to 1, maintaining the proportionality of each feature's contribution to the model's predictions. To address the issue, this method may require a review and potential adjustment in the logic employed for aggregating and normalizing feature importances across all trees in the model. This includes ensuring numerical stability and accuracy in the computation, particularly when dealing with a large number of estimators, to prevent the sum of importance scores from deviating from 1. The adjustment should be tested across varied conditions, including models with a large number of shallow trees, deep trees, and models trained on datasets of varying sizes and feature counts, to confirm that the normalized feature importance scores consistently sum up to 1 without affecting the existing functionality of the model."
