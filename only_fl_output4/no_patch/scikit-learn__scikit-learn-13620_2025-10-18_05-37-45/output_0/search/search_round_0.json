        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we'll need to gather more context about how feature importances are calculated within the Gradient Boosting algorithms implemented in `scikit-learn`. This involves examining the relevant classes and methods that contribute to this functionality. Based on the issue description, the key areas of interest are the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class, the underlying tree estimators used in the ensemble, and how feature importances are computed and aggregated across these estimators. Here are the API calls to perform:\n\n1. Search for the class where the Gradient Boosting Regressor is defined:\n   - `search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n2. Given the issue seems related to the calculation of feature importances in an ensemble method, we should look into how feature importances are computed within this class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"feature_importances_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n3. It is also mentioned that examining the tree at each stage could reveal more about the issue. Trees in gradient boosting are typically instances of a decision tree class. Let's find the class definition for the decision trees used within the gradient boosting algorithm. This information can help us understand how each tree's feature importances are calculated:\n   - `search_class(\"DecisionTreeRegressor\")`\n\n4. Since the problem appears once a large number of estimators are reached, and understanding that the ensemble method involves aggregating individual tree estimators, we should examine how these estimators are stored and accessed in the Gradient Boosting Regressor class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"estimators_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a good starting point to understand the underlying structure of `GradientBoostingRegressor`, how feature importances are computed, and how each estimator is involved in this process, enabling us to pinpoint the root cause of the issue."
