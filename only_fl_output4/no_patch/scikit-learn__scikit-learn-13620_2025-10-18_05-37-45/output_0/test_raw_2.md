Given the request to create a standalone Python script that reproduces a specific issue and handles the output as described, below is an adjusted version of `reproducer.py`. This script will reproduce the situation where the sum of feature importances in a Gradient Boosting model does not equal 1. It uses `AssertionError` to bring up the issue when detected, employs the provided function to print stack traces for clarity, and respects the process exit codes based on the detection of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    boston = datasets.load_boston()
    X, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)

    n_estimators = 720
    params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
    
    # Check that the sum of feature importances is close enough to 1
    assert np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, 1.0, atol=1e-4), f"Feature importance sum not equal to 1 but {feature_importance_sum}"

    print("No issues detected. Exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)
    
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1) # Indicate an error was detected
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1) # Handle any other unexpected errors
```

Please ensure you are executing this script in an environment where the sklearn and numpy packages are installed and properly configured. The code focuses on detecting if the sum of feature importances diverges significantly from 1, which is the core of the reported issue. The `atol=1e-4` parameter in `np.isclose` allows for a slight tolerance in numerical precision, adjusting this may be necessary depending on the precision level acceptable for the application.
