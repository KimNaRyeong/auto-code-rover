        "intended_behavior": "The method should be refactored to accept an additional parameter (e.g., pre_count) that represents the count of entries in the cache before deletion. This would enable the method to use this pre-computed count instead of executing another SELECT COUNT(*) query after deleting expired entries. The method should then calculate the new count by subtracting the number of rows deleted (accessible via cursor.rowcount) from the pre_count. This change would eliminate the need for the second count query, thereby reducing database load and optimizing performance."

        "intended_behavior": "Adjust the logic that invokes the _cull method within the cache setting operations to first perform a count of the current cache entries before deciding whether culling is necessary. This count should then be passed to the _cull method if it's invoked. This approach ensures that the _cull method has access to the pre-existing count, adhering to the optimization proposed in Bug Location 1. Additionally, introducing a condition or mechanism to trigger the culling process less frequently (e.g., every N cache set operations or based on a random probability) can further optimize performance by reducing the frequency of culling operations. This could be achieved by leveraging a configuration setting or internal counter to regulate the invocation of _cull. Care should be taken to ensure this mechanism does not compromise the effectiveness of the cache size management strategy."
