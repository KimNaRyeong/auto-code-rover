Moreover we added a cache backend for pymemcache (#29887) so we have a good builtin alternative.\nI think it's time to deprecate the django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache backend in Django 3.2 and remove it in Django 4.1.\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls that should provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `MemcachedCache` class to understand its current implementation:\n\n```\nsearch_class(\"MemcachedCache\")\n```\n\n2. Find where `MemcachedCache` is defined to review its use and references in the Django codebase:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"MemcachedCache\")\n```\n\n3. Gather context about how deprecation is typically handled in Django, which could be done by finding usages of deprecation warnings:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"RemovedInDjango41Warning\")\n```\n\n4. Since the plan is to deprecate `MemcachedCache` in Django 3.2 and remove it by Django 4.1, it would be useful to see if there's a standard module or method for handling deprecations:\n\n```\nsearch_method(\"deprecate\")\n```\n\nThese calls should give a comprehensive overview of where `MemcachedCache` is used, how deprecation is currently handled within Django, and where to implement deprecation warnings for the `MemcachedCache` class."
