        "intended_behavior": "The entire `MemcachedCache` class should be marked as deprecated starting in Django 3.2, signaling to developers that it will be removed in Django 4.1. This involves adding a deprecation warning to the class definition or its methods to inform developers of its future removal. The warning should instruct developers to migrate to the recommended `pymemcache` backend. Implementing a wrapper or a utility within the class to emit `RemovedInDjango41Warning` whenever the class is instantiated or methods are called could achieve this. The warning should specifically state that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated in favor of `pymemcache` based solutions, as noted in the issue description."

This may involve updating documentation within `deprecation.py` or ensuring existing mechanisms are well-suited for this case. This ensures consistency in how deprecation warnings are handled across the Django project."
