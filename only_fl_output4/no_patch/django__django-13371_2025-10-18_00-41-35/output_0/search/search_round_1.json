Key areas to search would be the implementation of `Row`, how `values_list(named=True)` works, and how Django handles pickle operations for its objects. Therefore, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Row\")`: This will help us understand the `Row` class's structure, its base classes, and any methods it defines that might be relevant for serialization (pickling).\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"Row\")`: This method is critical for customizing how an object is pickled. If `Row` is missing this method, it may lead to the pickling error.\n\n3. `search_method(\"values_list\")`: Since the issue arises from using `values_list(named=True)`, understanding its implementation will provide insights into how `Row` objects are created and why they might not be pickleable.\n\n4. `search_code(\"namedtuple\")`: Given that the issue mentions `namedtuple` and its connection to `Row`, searching for `namedtuple` usage within the Django codebase can help us understand how Django potentially uses `namedtuple` to implement `Row`, which can inform the fix for the pickling issue.\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough information on the `Row` class, its creation via `values_list(named=True)`, and the underlying pickle mechanism's handling by Django models and `namedtuple`."

        "content": "The analysis of the collected context provides several insights regarding the Django project and the issue at hand, specifically regarding `django.db.models.query.Row` not being pickleable.\n\n### Analysis of `values_list` Method\n\nFrom the search results, we have two essentially identical results for the `values_list` method found in `django/db/models/query.py`. The implementation of `values_list` allows the caller to specify fields from the model that should be returned in a list form. The `flat` and `named` parameters dictate the format of this list: `flat=True` returns a list of single values, while `named=True` returns a list of `namedtuple`s making the result similar in structure to a list of model instances.\n\n1. The purpose of this part of the code (`values_list` method) is to provide a flexible way of querying a subset of fields from a database table corresponding to a Django model. When `named=True`, it turns the result into instances of `namedtuple`, which theoretically should allow for both efficient access by name and the ability for these instances to be serialized (pickled) for caching or other purposes.\n\n2. The relationship between this part of the code and the bug is direct. The issue arises specifically when using `named=True` with `values_list`, which triggers the creation of `namedtuple` instances that are not pickleable. This suggests a problem with either how these `namedtuple` instances are created or with their compatibility with the pickling process.\n\n3. The intended behavior would be for the `namedtuple` instances (referred to as `django.db.models.query.Row`) created by the `values_list` method to be pickleable. This would allow them to be serialized for caching purposes, which is a common use case in Django projects, particularly to reduce database query overhead.\n\n### Relationship with `namedtuple` and Pickling\n\nSearching for `namedtuple` across the codebase and seeing multiple hits indicates that `namedtuple` is widely used within Django for creating lightweight, immutable objects that are easy to access by attribute names. However, the fact that we didn't directly find the `Row` class or any specific adaptation of `namedtuple` for it suggests that the issue may not be with `namedtuple` itself (which is generally pickleable) but with how Django is utilizing or augmenting it in the context of `values_list(named=True)`.\n\nThe lack of direct hits for `django.db.models.query.Row` in the codebase search indicates that `Row` might not be defined explicitly as a class but could be dynamically generated (a common use case for `namedtuple`). This dynamic generation might be missing necessary components for pickling, such as the `__reduce__` method, which was also not found.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue description and the context gathered:\n\n- It's crucial to examine further how Django generates these `namedtuple` instances in the context of `values_list(named=True)`. Specifically, we need to look at the serialization aspect and why it's failing. A potential path forward would be to search for any customizations or dynamic behaviors Django applies to these `namedtuple` instances after creation.\n- Examine how Django models are typically made pickleable. There's a possibility the custom or dynamic attributes/functions in the `Row` objects interfere with the standard pickling process.\n- Since `Row` instances seem not to be explicitly defined in the Django codebase, it may be necessary to investigate how Django dynamically defines these `namedtuple` classes within `values_list` and if any additional steps are required to make these objects pickleable.\n\nFurther investigation might require searching for more specific handling of serialization within Django's queryset handling or looking at bug reports and discussions on Django's development platforms for insights into challenges with making dynamically generated `namedtuple` instances pickleable."

This would likely involve adding or ensuring that the `__reduce__` method is correctly implemented for these `namedtuple` instances. The implementation must ensure that these instances can be serialized and deserialized without losing functionality, thereby allowing these objects to be used with caching mechanisms like `cacheops`. This should be done without affecting the current functionality of returning a queryset of `namedtuple` instances for improved user accessibility and performance. The fix may involve modifying the way `namedtuple` classes are dynamically created or augmenting them with additional methods to support pickling."
