        "content": "To address the issue mentioned regarding `django.db.models.query.Row` not being pickleable, we need to investigate how `Row` is implemented and how pickling works with `namedtuple` and potentially Django models. Key areas to search would be the implementation of `Row`, how `values_list(named=True)` works, and how Django handles pickle operations for its objects. Therefore, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Row\")`: This will help us understand the `Row` class's structure, its base classes, and any methods it defines that might be relevant for serialization (pickling).\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"Row\")`: This method is critical for customizing how an object is pickled. If `Row` is missing this method, it may lead to the pickling error.\n\n3. `search_method(\"values_list\")`: Since the issue arises from using `values_list(named=True)`, understanding its implementation will provide insights into how `Row` objects are created and why they might not be pickleable.\n\n4. `search_code(\"namedtuple\")`: Given that the issue mentions `namedtuple` and its connection to `Row`, searching for `namedtuple` usage within the Django codebase can help us understand how Django potentially uses `namedtuple` to implement `Row`, which can inform the fix for the pickling issue.\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough information on the `Row` class, its creation via `values_list(named=True)`, and the underlying pickle mechanism's handling by Django models and `namedtuple`."
