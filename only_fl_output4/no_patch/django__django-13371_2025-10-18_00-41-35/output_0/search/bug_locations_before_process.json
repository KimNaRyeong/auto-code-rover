        "intended_behavior": "The `values_list` method should ensure that the dynamically generated `namedtuple` instances, referred to as `Row` when `named=True`, are pickleable. This would likely involve adding or ensuring that the `__reduce__` method is correctly implemented for these `namedtuple` instances. The implementation must ensure that these instances can be serialized and deserialized without losing functionality, thereby allowing these objects to be used with caching mechanisms like `cacheops`. This should be done without affecting the current functionality of returning a queryset of `namedtuple` instances for improved user accessibility and performance. The fix may involve modifying the way `namedtuple` classes are dynamically created or augmenting them with additional methods to support pickling."
