However jQuery's popularity, especially for making requests, is decreasing thanks to changes such as the new fetch() JS API.\nAlso in the cases this property is used to determine the kind of content to send to a client, it'd be better to inspect the HTTP standard Accept header.\nFor these reasons Flask has deprecated its similar property is_xhr.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from the search API calls provides the necessary insights into the `is_ajax` method within the Django `HttpRequest` class and its usage across the codebase. Let's analyze the results:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the `is_ajax` Method Implementation:\n- **Location**: The method is defined in `django/http/request.py` within the `HttpRequest` class.\n- **Current Behavior**: The `is_ajax` method checks if the `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` header is present and equals to `'XMLHttpRequest'`. This header is typically set by JavaScript libraries such as jQuery when making AJAX requests.\n- **Code Snippet**: \n  ```python\n  def is_ajax(self):\n      return self.META.get('HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH') == 'XMLHttpRequest'\n  ```\n  \n### 2. Relationship With the Issue:\n- The `is_ajax` method is directly related to the described issue, as it relies on a non-standard request header to determine if a request is made via AJAX. The issue emphasizes the decreasing relevance of jQuery (and, by extension, patterns that depend on it, such as the use of the `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` header) due to modern JavaScript features like the Fetch API.\n- According to the issue description, relying on this method is outdated, and inspecting the standard `Accept` header would be a better practice. Other frameworks like Flask have already deprecated similar methods, indicating a shift in web development practices.\n\n### 3. Intended Behavior Post-deprecation:\n- **Deprecating the Method**: The core of the issue involves deprecating the `is_ajax` method as its reliance on the `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` header is becoming increasingly obsolete due to shifts in frontend development practices.\n- **Guidance on Alternatives**: After deprecation, developers would be guided to use more standard approaches, such as inspecting the `Accept` header directly to make decisions based on the request's nature (e.g., deciding the format of the response).\n\nIn summary, given the context, the desired outcome is to deprecate the `is_ajax` method in a way that signals to developers it's no longer the recommended approach for AJAX detection due to its dependence on outdated practices. This involves marking the method as deprecated in the Django source code and documentation, and possibly providing alternatives or guidance for achieving similar functionality using more modern and standard patterns."

To resolve the issue:\n     - The method should be marked as deprecated, indicating to developers that it should no longer be used for new code. This could involve adding a deprecation warning within the method that gets triggered when it is called.\n     - Documentation around `HttpRequest.is_ajax` should be updated to reflect its deprecation and to guide developers on alternative methods for achieving similar results, specifically recommending inspecting the `Accept` header for determining the request type.\n     - Provide examples or guidance on how to use the `Accept` header for such scenarios to encourage developers to migrate away from the deprecated method.\n     - This adjustment aims to steer developers towards more standard practices while ensuring that existing functionalities relying on `is_ajax` can continue to operate until developers transition to the recommended approach."
