        "intended_behavior": "The method `is_ajax` itself doesn't contain a bug in its current functionality; rather, the issue is with its relevance and best practice in modern web development. To resolve the issue:\n- The method should be marked as deprecated, indicating to developers that it should no longer be used for new code. This could involve adding a deprecation warning within the method that gets triggered when it is called.\n- Documentation around `HttpRequest.is_ajax` should be updated to reflect its deprecation and to guide developers on alternative methods for achieving similar results, specifically recommending inspecting the `Accept` header for determining the request type.\n- Provide examples or guidance on how to use the `Accept` header for such scenarios to encourage developers to migrate away from the deprecated method.\n- This adjustment aims to steer developers towards more standard practices while ensuring that existing functionalities relying on `is_ajax` can continue to operate until developers transition to the recommended approach."
