        "content": "To address the issue described, we would need to gather more context about the specific migration script causing the problem, along with any relevant classes or methods mentioned. Based on the issue description, the following API calls would be suitable:\n\n1. Search for the code around the problematic line mentioned in the `0011_update_proxy_permissions` migration script. Since the issue occurs on line 42 with the `with transaction.atomic():` block and the subsequent code that updates permissions, we will look at the code around this line to understand the context better.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py\", 42, 10)`\n\n2. The issue description hints at a problem with handling multiple databases and a specific configuration setup where the default database is not set. Given this, it's critical to look at how the `Permission` model's `objects` are being accessed, which suggests looking into the `Permission` model itself, especially how database routing is handled.\n   - `search_class(\"Permission\")`\n\n3. Since the `Permission` model is likely to use Django's ORM functionality comprehensively, it would be useful to understand how queries are routed to different databases, especially in context of the `transaction.atomic()` method. Therefore, it might be worth checking if there are any custom database router configurations or methods that override default database routing logic.\n   - `search_method(\"db_for_write\")`\n   - `search_method(\"db_for_read\")`\n\n4. Understanding how transactions are managed in a multi-database setup in Django could give insights into solving the problem or at least mitigating it without breaking the migration script's integrity. This requires looking into how the `transaction.atomic()` method is implemented.\n   - `search_method(\"atomic\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` migration is supposed to work, how the `Permission` object interacts with the database, and how Django's transaction and database routing mechanisms could affect this process."
