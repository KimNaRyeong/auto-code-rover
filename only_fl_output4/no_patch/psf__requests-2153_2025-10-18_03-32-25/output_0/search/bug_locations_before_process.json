        "intended_behavior": "Within every class or method that makes HTTP POST requests, incorporate a try-except block to handle exceptions more comprehensively, specifically targeting socket.timeout alongside requests.exceptions.Timeout. This exception handling should ensure that socket.timeout exceptions are explicitly caught and can either be logged for monitoring purposes or used to trigger retry logic, depending on the criticality and nature of the request. requests.exceptions.Timeout continues to be caught and managed as per existing practices, ensuring that application functionality remains unaffected by intermittent network issues or server-side problems causing timeouts."
