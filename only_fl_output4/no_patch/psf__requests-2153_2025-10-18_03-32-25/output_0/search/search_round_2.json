Since there is a requests exception for it, I assume that the socket exception was supposed to be caught and the requests one raise instead. The full stack trace is:\n``` python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 132, in <module>\ntest_stuff()\nFile \"test.py\", line 113, in test_stuff\nbrowse_recursively()\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 101, in browse_recursively\nfor new_item in wimp.browse(item):\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 207, in browse\nresponse = post(self._url, headers, body)\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 40, in post\nout = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=body, timeout=1.0)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 87, in post\nreturn request('post', url, data=data, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 44, in request\nreturn session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 279, in request\nresp = self.send(prep, stream=stream, timeout=timeout, verify=verify, cert=cert, proxies=proxies)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 374, in send\nr = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py\", line 222, in send\nr.content\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 550, in content\nself._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/utils.py\", line 363, in stream_decompress\nfor chunk in iterator:\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 496, in generate\nchunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 146, in read\nreturn self._fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 567, in read\ns = self.fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 380, in read\ndata = self._sock.recv(left)\nsocket.timeout: timed out\n```\nThe development is for a plugin for the music service Wimp for the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) project, which means that I could post code to reproduce, but you will not be able to run it without a Sonos speaker and a Wimp subscription.

The stack trace mentions `soco/plugins/wimp.py` and the `post` method within it. It also refers to classes and methods within the `requests` library, but those are external to the SoCo project, so our focus will primarily be on how the `requests.post` function is being utilized within the SoCo project, specifically in the Wimp plugin.\n\nGiven the information, here are the necessary API calls to gather adequate code context:\n\n1. **Search for the `post` function within the `wimp.py` file:** This is directly mentioned in the stack trace (`soco/plugins/wimp.py`, line 40). We want to see the implementation or usage of the `requests.post` call within this method to understand how exceptions are caught or potentially missed.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"post\", \"soco/plugins/wimp.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Get code around the line where the exception is thrown:** The stack trace ends within the Python standard library `socket.py`, specifically around a read operation that times out. However, insights into how the `post` method in the SoCo project handles its timeout can be crucial. We know the exact location of the `post` method call, so let's examine the surrounding code to better understand its error handling.\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"soco/plugins/wimp.py\", 40, 10)\n```\n\nThese API calls are our initial steps to gain a deeper understanding of the issue and formulate a strategy for appropriately catching and handling the `socket.timeout` exception within the SoCo project's scope, ensuring it aligns with how timeouts are expected to be handled in the broader context of `requests` usage."

Finding this method may give us clues on how requests to external services are handled, and it could be related to or a substitute for the 'post' method initially sought.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"browse\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for custom exception handling related to `requests.exceptions.Timeout` or `socket.timeout`:** This could provide insights on whether there's an established pattern for dealing with timeouts in the project that was somehow bypassed in the instance reported.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"requests.exceptions.Timeout\")\nsearch_code(\"socket.timeout\")\n```\n\nThese adjusted API calls aim to get a comprehensive view of the SoCo's project structure and handling of network requests and timeout exceptions.

It may not be catching `socket.timeout` explicitly, leading to instances where this lower-level exception leaks through the abstraction provided by the `requests` library.\n- Ensure that all network request-related operations are wrapped in a try-except block that can handle both `requests.exceptions.Timeout` and `socket.timeout`, abstracting the handling of timeout exceptions away from the rest of the codebase.\n\nWithout the actual code or search results from the provided APIs, these locations and behaviors remain hypothetical and suggest general approaches based on the description of the issue.

This could provide clues on how the project structure is organized or if there's been recent refactoring that could affect file paths and class names.\n- **Manual Review:** If possible, manually reviewing the project's codebase (assuming access is available but not through the provided API calls) could identify the correct files or methods needing attention.\n\n### If API Calls Were Possible:\nGiven the absence of direct results from API calls, to speculate on the intended behavior without direct code insights:\n\n- **Exception Handling:** The part of the code responsible for making HTTP requests using `requests.post` should include robust exception handling that catches both `requests.exceptions.Timeout` and `socket.timeout`, ensuring that any timeout is caught and handled uniformly. This could potentially prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly and provide a consistent error handling strategy across the application.\n- **Request Retries or Logging:** Additionally, implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors or improved error logging around the request could help mitigate the impact of timeouts and provide developers with more insight into recurring issues.\n\nUnfortunately, without specific code snippets or file access, we are limited in providing a focused analysis or recommendations for the identified locations needing fixes. The next steps would ideally involve obtaining updated project information or gaining direct access to review the project's current structure and codebase for a more accurate assessment and resolution proposal."
