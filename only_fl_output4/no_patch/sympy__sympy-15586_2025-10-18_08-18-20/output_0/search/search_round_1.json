To change this behavior, the\n180     \"modules\" argument can be used. It accepts:\n181 \n182      - the strings \"math\", \"mpmath\", \"numpy\", \"numexpr\", \"sympy\", \"tensorflow\"\n183      - any modules (e.g. math)\n184      - dictionaries that map names of sympy functions to arbitrary functions\n185      - lists that contain a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n186        given to entries appearing first.\n187 \n188     .. warning::\n189         Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on\n190         unsanitized input.\n191 \n192     Arguments in the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers\n193     are substitued with dummy symbols.

As of release 1.0 ``numpy.array`` is the default.\n209     To get the old default behavior you must pass in ``[{'ImmutableDenseMatrix':\n210     numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']`` to the ``modules`` kwarg.\n211 \n212     >>> from sympy import lambdify, Matrix\n213     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n214     >>> import numpy\n215     >>> array2mat = [{'ImmutableDenseMatrix': numpy.matrix}, 'numpy']\n216     >>> f = lambdify((x, y), Matrix([x, y]), modules=array2mat)\n217     >>> f(1, 2)\n218     matrix([[1],\n219             [2]])\n220 \n221     Usage\n222     =====\n223 \n224     (1) Use one of the provided modules:\n225 \n226         >>> from sympy import sin, tan, gamma\n227         >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n228         >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), \"math\")\n229 \n230         Attention: Functions that are not in the math module will throw a name\n231                    error when the function definition is evaluated! So this\n232                    would be better:\n233 \n234         >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x)*gamma(x), (\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"))\n235 \n236     (2) Use some other module:\n237 \n238         >>> import numpy\n239         >>> f = lambdify((x,y), tan(x*y), numpy)\n240 \n241         Attention: There are naming differences between numpy and sympy. So if\n242                    you simply take the numpy module, e.g. sympy.atan will not be\n243                    translated to numpy.arctan. Use the modified module instead\n244                    by passing the string \"numpy\":\n245 \n246         >>> f = lambdify((x,y), tan(x*y), \"numpy\")\n247         >>> f(1, 2)\n248         -2.18503986326\n249         >>> from numpy import array\n250         >>> f(array([1, 2, 3]), array([2, 3, 5]))\n251         [-2.18503986 -0.29100619 -0.8559934 ]\n252 \n253         In the above examples, the generated functions can accept scalar\n254         values or numpy arrays as arguments.  However, in some cases\n255         the generated function relies on the input being a numpy array:\n256 \n257         >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n258         >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"numpy\")\n259         >>> f(array([-1, 0, 1, 2]))\n260         [-1.   0.   1.   0.5]\n261         >>> f(0)\n262         Traceback (most recent call last):\n263             ...\n264         ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n265 \n266         In such cases, the input should be wrapped in a numpy array:\n267         >>> float(f(array([0])))\n268         0.0\n269 \n270         Or if numpy functionality is not required another module can be used:\n271         >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"math\")\n272         >>> f(0)\n273         0\n274 \n275     (3) Use a dictionary defining custom functions:\n276 \n277         >>> def my_cool_function(x): return 'sin(%s) is cool' % x\n278         >>> myfuncs = {\"sin\" : my_cool_function}\n279         >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), myfuncs); f(1)\n280         'sin(1) is cool'\n281 \n282     Examples\n283     ========\n284 \n285     >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n286     >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n287     >>> from sympy import Function\n288     >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n289 \n290     >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n291     >>> f(2)\n292     4\n293     >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n294     >>> f(1,2,3)\n295     [3, 2, 1]\n296     >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n297     >>> f(4)\n298     2.0\n299     >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n300     >>> f(0, 5)\n301     0.0\n302     >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n303     >>> row(1, 2)\n304     Matrix([[1, 3]])\n305 \n306     Tuple arguments are handled and the lambdified function should\n307     be called with the same type of arguments as were used to create\n308     the function.:\n309 \n310     >>> f = lambdify((x, (y, z)), x + y)\n311     >>> f(1, (2, 4))\n312     3\n313 \n314     A more robust way of handling this is to always work with flattened\n315     arguments:\n316 \n317     >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import flatten\n318     >>> args = w, (x, (y, z))\n319     >>> vals = 1, (2, (3, 4))\n320     >>> f = lambdify(flatten(args), w + x + y + z)\n321     >>> f(*flatten(vals))\n322     10\n323 \n324     Functions present in `expr` can also carry their own numerical\n325     implementations, in a callable attached to the ``_imp_``\n326     attribute.  Usually you attach this using the\n327     ``implemented_function`` factory:\n328 \n329     >>> f = implemented_function(Function('f'), lambda x: x+1)\n330     >>> func = lambdify(x, f(x))\n331     >>> func(4)\n332     5\n333 \n334     ``lambdify`` always prefers ``_imp_`` implementations to implementations\n335     in other namespaces, unless the ``use_imps`` input parameter is False.\n336 \n337     Usage with Tensorflow module:\n338 \n339     >>> import tensorflow as tf\n340     >>> f = Max(x, sin(x))\n341     >>> func = lambdify(x, f, 'tensorflow')\n342     >>> result = func(tf.constant(1.0))\n343     >>> result #

        "content": "Upon examining the gathered context, let\u2019s analyze each part:\n\n### 1. `MatrixSymbol` Class (from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`)\n\n#### Analysis:\nThis class represents matrices in symbolic form. It is part of SymPy's infrastructure for handling symbolic matrix expressions. The methods within `MatrixSymbol` support creating symbolic matrices, evaluating them under certain conditions, and manipulating their properties. Key attributes and methods like `is_commutative`, `shape`, and `name` enable it to seamlessly integrate within symbolic computations.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug:\nThe issue experienced is not directly related to the definition of `MatrixSymbol` but rather how instances of matrix symbols are used, specifically in inversion operations. Since `MatrixSymbol` instances represent matrices symbolically, the failure occurs when trying to perform a numerical operation (`lambdify`) on these symbolic representations.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nThe `MatrixSymbol` class is intended to provide an interface for working with matrices symbolically. When inverting a matrix symbolically represented by `MatrixSymbol`, the expected behavior in the context of SymPy is to produce another symbolic expression representing the inverted matrix. When attempting numerical evaluation via `lambdify`, the intended behavior would include translating this symbolic expression into a numerical computation, preserving the mathematical correctness of the inversion operation.\n\n### 2. `lambdify` Function (from `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`)\n\n#### Analysis:\n`lambdify` transforms SymPy expressions into lambda functions that can be evaluated numerically. It bridges the gap between symbolic mathematics in SymPy and numerical computations in libraries like NumPy. Its arguments allow for specifying the mathematical expression to be evaluated, the symbolic variables within that expression, and the numerical library modules to use for the evaluation.\n\nThe function documentation highlights its flexibility in accepting different modules (`numpy`, `math`, `mpmath`, etc.) for numerical operations. This adaptability is crucial for performing a wide range of mathematical computations efficiently, including matrix inversion.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug:\nThe bug arises during the use of `lambdify` to convert a symbolic matrix inversion into a numpy-compatible numerical function. The `TypeError` suggests a mismatch between the expected input type or operation within the `lambdify` generated function and the provided numpy matrix `xx`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n`lambdify` is expected to generate a lambda function that, when applied to numpy arrays (or matrices), performs the intended mathematical operation numerically. For matrix inversion, the expected outcome is a new numpy array representing the inverted matrix. The conversion process should seamlessly handle the symbolic-to-numeric transition, ensuring mathematical operations such as inversion are correctly implemented.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps:\nGiven the analysis, the issue seems to stem from the interaction between `lambdify` and numpy's numerical computing capabilities, particularly around matrix inversion. The intended behavior is a seamless conversion of symbolic matrix inversion into a numerically evaluated inversion operation compatible with numpy arrays. A closer look into how `lambdify` constructs the numerical lambda function for matrix inversion operations, and ensuring compatibility with numpy's matrix operations, might be necessary.\n\nTo further diagnose the bug, it may be valuable to:\n- Investigate how `lambdify` handles symbolic matrix inversion specifically, which might require a deeper dive into how the `modules` parameter is utilized and how numpy's operations are mapped within `lambdify`.\n- Examine `lambdify`'s handling of numpy arrays, especially with operations like inversion, to ensure that the symbolic-to-numeric transition is performed correctly.\n\nGiven the lack of direct code examples in the results for `np.linalg.inv` and symbolic matrix inversion (`MatrixSymbol('X0',2,2)**-1`), further exploration might involve more detailed analysis of the `lambdify` source code or crafting test cases that replicate the issue in a controlled environment. This could include experimenting with different `modules` parameters in `lambdify` or inspecting how numpy arrays are processed when passed to lambdified functions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

To resolve the issue, `lambdify` should ensure that it correctly handles the conversion of matrix inversion operations in SymPy expressions into equivalent NumPy operations when the NumPy module is used. Specifically, it needs to properly map symbolic matrix inversion to NumPy's numerical matrix inversion function (`numpy.linalg.inv`). This mapping must take into account the dimensions and data types of the input to ensure compatibility. Additionally, any potential discrepancies that could lead to the type error seen in the issue (\"TypeError: ufunc 'bitwise_xor' not supported for the input types\") need to be identified and corrected. This may involve adjusting how `lambdify` interprets the inversion operation (`**-1`) in the context of numerical computations with NumPy, ensuring that the transformed function can accept a NumPy array as input and return its matrix inverse without error.\n\nGiven the specifics of the issue, the correction should allow for seamless usage of `lambdify` to generate functions that perform matrix inversion using NumPy, maintaining correct mathematical results, and not leading to type errors or misinterpretation of the inversion operation. This ensures that users can continue to leverage `lambdify` for efficient numerical computation alongside symbolic computation in SymPy without requiring manual intervention or workaround to handle matrix operations."
