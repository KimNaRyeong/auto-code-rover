        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function is intended to convert SymPy expressions into callable functions that can numerically evaluate expressions using libraries like NumPy. To resolve the issue, `lambdify` should ensure that it correctly handles the conversion of matrix inversion operations in SymPy expressions into equivalent NumPy operations when the NumPy module is used. Specifically, it needs to properly map symbolic matrix inversion to NumPy's numerical matrix inversion function (`numpy.linalg.inv`). This mapping must take into account the dimensions and data types of the input to ensure compatibility. Additionally, any potential discrepancies that could lead to the type error seen in the issue (\"TypeError: ufunc 'bitwise_xor' not supported for the input types\") need to be identified and corrected. This may involve adjusting how `lambdify` interprets the inversion operation (`**-1`) in the context of numerical computations with NumPy, ensuring that the transformed function can accept a NumPy array as input and return its matrix inverse without error."
