        "content": "To address the issue in a standalone Python file according to the requirements, let's amend the original approach to ensure the script exits with code 0 when the issue is resolved and properly identifies the exception otherwise.\n\nPlease note, this assumes a working environment where both NumPy and SymPy are correctly installed and functioning. If \"ModuleNotFoundError\" errors were previously encountered, it could indicate an issue with the Python environment setup rather than with the script itself.\n\nHere's an updated version of `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ntry:\n    import numpy as np\n    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify, init_printing\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    print(\"Required modules are not installed.\")\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ntry:\n    init_printing()\n\n    X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 2, 2)\n    xx = np.random.rand(4, 4)\n    X0Inv = X0**-1\n    np.linalg.inv(xx)  # Verify if numpy can invert the matrix; this is expected to work\n    \n    symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv, 'numpy') # Explicitly use 'numpy' for lambdify to avoid confusion\n    result = symInv(xx)  # The statement that raises TypeError\n\n    # Check if the result is what we expected (inverted matrix), to confirm no errors\n    assert np.allclose(np.dot(result, xx), np.eye(4)), \"The inversion did not produce the expected result.\"\n    print(\"Success: The issue is fixed.\")\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the assertion failed\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    print(\"Failure: An unexpected error occurred, indicating the issue is not resolved.\")\n    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate an unexpected error\n\nsys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed\n```\n\nThis version checks for the presence of required modules (`numpy` and `sympy`) and includes refined error handling. An assertion is used to test if the inverted matrix, when multiplied back with the original, results in an identity matrix, indicating a successful inversion. Exceptions are caught to provide detailed error outputs using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. The exit codes are now explicitly set based on the execution outcome: `0` when the issue is fixed and `1` for both assertion failures and unexpected errors, ensuring proper signaling to the caller or surrounding infrastructure."
