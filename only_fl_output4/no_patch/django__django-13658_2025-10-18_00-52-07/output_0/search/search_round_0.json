Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\nparser = CommandParser(\nprog=self.prog_name,\nusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\nadd_help=False,\nallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n</issue>"

Search for the `__init__` method within the `ManagementUtility` class to see how it is currently implemented and to confirm the issue's description of how `prog_name` is being set:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"ManagementUtility\")\n```\n\n3. Search for uses of the `CommandParser` constructor to see where it is being instantiated without the `prog` argument as highlighted in the issue.
