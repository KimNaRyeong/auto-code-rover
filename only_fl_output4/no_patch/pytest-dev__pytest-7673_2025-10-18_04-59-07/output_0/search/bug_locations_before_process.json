        "intended_behavior": "The intention is to ensure that `_initial_handler_level` correctly captures the handler's initial logging level before any `set_level` calls adjust it. This is to ensure that after a test concludes, regardless of how many times `set_level` is invoked, the handler's level can be restored to its original setting. To fix the bug, a check should be added to only set `_initial_handler_level` if it hasn't been set previously in the test's context. This could be accomplished by initially defining `_initial_handler_level` as `None` (or another sentinel value indicating an unset state) and then updating the code at the problematic line as follows:\n\n```python\nif self._initial_handler_level is None:\n    self._initial_handler_level = self.handler.level\n```\n\nThis ensures that `_initial_handler_level` is only set the first time `set_level` is called, preserving its original intent of capturing the handler's level prior to any test-induced modifications. Subsequent calls to `set_level` would change the handler level as needed, but without overwriting the initially captured level, thus facilitating correct restoration afterwards."
