Creating a standalone Python script that reproduces the issue is a delicate task, especially when working with a complex library such as Sympy and missing dependencies like NumPy. The goal of the script is to mimic the function calls and assertions that are failing due to the absence of NumPy. Keeping in mind the nature of the reported problems, it's clear that certain functionalities depend on NumPy for numerical computations and others that can work independently.

Given that, this script will try to focus on the areas specified in the reported issues, attempting to reproduce them without the direct dependency on NumPy. However, please note that without Sympy's full context, especially for issues deeply integrated with its internal workings and its relationship with NumPy, some parts of this script might need adjustments to fully replicate your exact environment or setup.

```python
# reproducer.py
import math
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy import Sum, factorial, oo, N, S, symbols, Matrix
    from sympy.abc import n, x

    # Simulating the test conditions as per the reported errors.
    # sympy.concrete.tests.test_sums_products
    pistr = "3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899" # First 100 digits of Pi
    pi_test = Sum(4*factorial(n)**4*(1103 + 26390*n)/factorial(n)**4/396**(4*n), (n, 0, oo))
    assert str(N(pi_test, 100)) == pistr

    # sympy.utilities.tests.test_lambdify
    f = lambdify(x, S('sin(x)'), 'math')
    assert isinstance(f(2), float)

    # sympy.matrices.tests (example adjusted because exact import paths/details were not provided)
    # A recreated condition similar to what might cause DeferredVector example failure.
    v = Matrix([1, 2, 3])
    func = lambda v: (v[0]*3, v[0]*6)
    assert func(v) == (3, 6)

    print("No issue detected. All tests passed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)

except AssertionError as e:
    print("AssertionError detected during test execution.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with non-zero code indicates failure in test conditions.
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script:

- Checks for a mathematical calculation likely to fail without NumPy due to precision issues.
- Mimics a utility test using `lambdify` with the `'math'` module, simulating a condition when NumPy is not available.
- Attempts to replicate matrix-related operations that could reflect the `DeferredVector` related failure.

It includes a conservative approach to error handling, distinguishing between expected assertion errors (indicating a test condition failure as in the reported issues) and unexpected errors that help differentiate between syntactic/script errors and logical/assertion failures tailored to this specific scenario.
