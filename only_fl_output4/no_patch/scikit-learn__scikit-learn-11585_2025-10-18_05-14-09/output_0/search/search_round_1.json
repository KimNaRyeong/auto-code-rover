        "content": "<issue>SparsePCA incorrectly scales results in .transform()\n#### Description\nWhen using `SparsePCA`, the `transform()` method incorrectly scales the results based on the *number of rows* in the data matrix passed.\n#### Proposed Fix\nI am regrettably unable to do a pull request from where I sit. The issue is with this chunk of code, as of writing this at [line number 179 in sparse_pca.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py#L179):\n```python\nU = ridge_regression(self.components_.T, X.T, ridge_alpha,\nsolver='cholesky')\ns = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\ns[s == 0] = 1\nU /= s\nreturn U\n```\nI honestly do not understand the details of the chosen implementation of SparsePCA. Depending on the objectives of the class, making use of the features as significant for unseen examples requires one of two modifications. Either (a) **learn** the scale factor `s` from the training data (i.e., make it an instance attribute like `.scale_factor_`), or (b) use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` to remove the number-of-examples dependency.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA\nimport numpy as np\ndef get_data( count, seed ):\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ncol1 = np.random.random(count)\ncol2 = np.random.random(count)\ndata = np.hstack([ a[:,np.newaxis] for a in [\ncol1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n-col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\ncol2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n]])\nreturn data\ntrain = get_data(1000,1)\nspca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)\nresults_train = spca.fit_transform( train )\ntest = get_data(10,1)\nresults_test = spca.transform( test )\nprint( \"Training statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_train.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_train.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_train.min() )\nprint( \"Testing statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_test.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_test.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_test.min() )\n```\nOutput:\n```\nTraining statistics:\nmean:       -0.009\nmax:        0.067\nmin:       -0.080\nTesting statistics:\nmean:       -0.107\nmax:        0.260\nmin:       -0.607\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe test results min/max values are on the same scale as the training results.\n#### Actual Results\nThe test results min/max values are much larger than the training results, because fewer examples were used. It is trivial to repeat this process with various sizes of training and testing data to see the relationship.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API results provides us with detailed insights into how `SparsePCA`'s `.transform()` method operates, and its relationship to the bug presented in the issue.\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `.transform()` method in `SparsePCA` carries out the following steps:\n1. It ensures that the model has been fitted by checking if `self.components_` is available using `check_is_fitted`.\n2. `X` is verified and possibly converted into a compatible array using `check_array`.\n3. It conditionally raises a deprecation warning for directly passing `ridge_alpha` within the `.transform()` call, encouraging users to specify `ridge_alpha` in the `SparsePCA` constructor instead.\n4. Then, it executes ridge regression using the transposed components of the fitted model, the transposed input data `X`, and the `ridge_alpha` parameter. This operation results in a transformed version of `X`.\n5. The transformation steps calculate a scale factor `s` from the results of the ridge regression by summing squared values (`(U ** 2).sum(axis=0)`) and taking the square root.\n6. To ensure no division by zero, it replaces any zero values in `s` with 1.\n7. Finally, each component in `U` is standardized by dividing it by `s`, and `U` is returned as transformed data.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe issue described pertains to the step where the scale factor `s` is computed and used to scale the transformed data (`U`). The scale factor is derived based on the sum of squared values across columns (`sum(axis=0)`). The problem highlighted is that this scaling is influenced by the number of rows (samples) in the data passed to `.transform()`, causing inconsistencies in scale between training and testing datasets that differ in size.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nConsidering the issue and the provided context, the intended behavior appears to involve adjusting the scaling of `U` in such a way that the scale factor does not depend on the sample size. This would entail either:\n- Adjust the scaling factor calculation to use a measure that is invariant to the number of samples, as suggested by the proposed fix to use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)`. This approach eliminates the dependency on the number of examples.\n- Learn the scale factor `s` from the training data and store it as part of the model (`self.scale_factor_`), so it can be applied to future transformations consistently, regardless of the input data `X`'s size.\n\nBoth modifications aim to ensure that the transformed data (`U`) maintains consistent scaling across different datasets (in terms of numbers of samples), thus addressing the reported scaling issue."

This could be achieved in two possible ways:\n        1. **Adjusting the Calculation of `s`**: Instead of using `.sum(axis=0)` which sums the squared values across columns and results in a scale factor influenced by the number of samples, use `.mean(axis=0)` which calculates the mean square value across columns. This change would normalize the scale factor to be consistent across different input sizes.\n             - Replace line `183`:\n                 ```python\n                 s = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\n                 ```\n               with\n                 ```python\n                 s = np.sqrt((U ** 2).mean(axis=0))\n                 ```\n        2. **Learning and Applying a Consistent Scale Factor**: Alternatively, the scale factor could be learned during the `.fit()` method execution and stored in the model. This scale factor would then be applied in the `.transform()` method. This approach requires significant modifications across both `.fit()` and `.transform()` methods:\n             - In `.fit()`, calculate the scale factor from the fitted data and store it in an instance attribute (like `self.scale_factor_`).\n             - In `.transform()`, apply this learned scale factor instead of calculating a new one from the input `X`.\n\n       The first solution is simpler and directly addresses the reported bug without altering the class's design significantly. The second solution introduces a new concept of a persisted scale factor which might offer better consistency across transformations but requires careful consideration of its implications on the model's current and future state management."
