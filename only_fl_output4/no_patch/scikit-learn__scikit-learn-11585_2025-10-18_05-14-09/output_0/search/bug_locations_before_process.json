        "intended_behavior": "The `.transform()` method's procedure for scaling the results (U) after ridge regression needs adjustment to make the scaling factor (`s`) independent of the input data size. This could be achieved in two possible ways: 1. **Adjusting the Calculation of `s`**: Instead of using `.sum(axis=0)` which sums the squared values across columns and results in a scale factor influenced by the number of samples, use `.mean(axis=0)` which calculates the mean square value across columns. This change would normalize the scale factor to be consistent across different input sizes. 2. **Learning and Applying a Consistent Scale Factor**: Alternatively, the scale factor could be learned during the `.fit()` method execution and stored in the model. This scale factor would then be applied in the `.transform()` method. This approach requires significant modifications across both `.fit()` and `.transform()` methods."
