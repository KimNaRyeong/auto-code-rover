        "intended_behavior": "When a colormap is registered with a new name, the method should update or ensure that any internal mechanisms (potentially within a colormap registry or cache) are consistent with this newly registered name. That way, when a registered name is queried through get_cmap or used in imshow, the system should recognize and return the correct colormap without errors. This requires ensuring the method effectively handles and reflects the registered name across all relevant parts of the library. The fix should preserve the ability to register colormaps with custom names and ensure these custom names are consistently recognized across Matplotlib functions."

        "method": "get_cmap",
        "intended_behavior": "This method should be reviewed to ensure that it serves as a reliable reference model for colormap name resolution. Since get_cmap can successfully retrieve the colormap using its registered name, ensuring other methods that need to resolve colormap names (like imshow) adhere to or use the same resolution logic might help solve the inconsistency observed. While not necessarily buggy as per the issue description, ensuring its logic is consistent with how colormaps are expected to be resolved in each context (especially in light of any changes to register_cmap) is crucial."
