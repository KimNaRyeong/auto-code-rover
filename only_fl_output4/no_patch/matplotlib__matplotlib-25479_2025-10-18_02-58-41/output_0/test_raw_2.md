Given your request and correcting the previous mistake, here's how you can create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue with colormap name handling. This script checks whether the issue of referring to a registered colormap by a name different than its initially given name still persists, and properly uses try-except blocks to capture the error and print a stack trace.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_colormap_issue():
    # Import necessary libraries
    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.cm as cm
    import matplotlib

    # Create a custom colormap
    my_cmap_data = [[ 1.5e-03, 4.7e-04, 1.4e-02],
                    [ 2.3e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-02],
                    [ 3.3e-03, 2.3e-03, 2.4e-02]]
    my_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('some_cmap_name', my_cmap_data)
    cm.register_cmap(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)

    # Set colormap and plot
    try:
        plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')
        plt.imshow([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
        plt.show()  # This line is not necessary for the test but helps visualize if running manually
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        reproduce_colormap_issue()
        print("The issue has been fixed or cannot be reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as ex:
        print("AssertionError:", ex)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code indicating failure or issue present
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:", e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)  # Exit with code indicating success or no issue
```

Please, run this script with Python 3 to ensure compatibility with the used Matplotlib APIs. Note that this script assumes the matplotlib version where `cm.register_cmap` was used directly for registering a colormap (which is a correct approach in some versions). However, API details such as how to properly register colormaps might vary between matplotlib versions. Always refer to the specific version's documentation of Matplotlib if there's any doubt.
