        "intended_behavior": "The `remove_column` method needs to check if the column being removed is listed as a required column (as `_required_columns` might be customized beyond the default and include more than just `time`). If an attempt to remove a required column is made, the method should raise a clear and specific exception stating which required column cannot be removed, rather than the current misleading message. This exception message should be something along the lines of: `ValueError: Cannot remove 'flux'; it is a required column for this TimeSeries object.` This update preserves the functionality of preventing the removal of essential data while improving clarity for the user."
