            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we first need to gather more context about how columns, particularly \"required columns,\" are handled within the `TimeSeries` class, as well as how exceptions are raised when an attempt is made to remove a required column. Based on the detailed issue description, let's focus on finding the relevant class definitions, methods, and perhaps the code section that triggers the misleading exception. The steps outlined in the \"Steps to Reproduce\" section hint that we should focus on the `TimeSeries` class, its `remove_column` method, and possibly any internal mechanisms for validating columns (especially checking required columns). \n\nHere are the search API calls that should provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `TimeSeries` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods related to column management:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"TimeSeries\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `remove_column` method within the `TimeSeries` class to see how columns are removed, and more importantly, if there's a check for required columns happening there:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"remove_column\", \"TimeSeries\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the exception mentions an issue with how the `TimeSeries` object validates its required columns, it's also crucial to understand how this validation is implemented. Therefore, we need to search for any validation methods that might be involved in ensuring the presence of required columns:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"validate_columns\", \"TimeSeries\")\n   ```\n   \n4. The issue describes a situation where the manipulation of `_required_columns` attribute directly leads to a misleading exception and mentions modifying this attribute then attempting to remove a column. This suggests there might be specific logic around handling `_required_columns`. Let's find references to `_required_columns` to see how it's used across the codebase:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"_required_columns\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should help in gathering enough context around how `TimeSeries` manages its columns, specifically the logic regarding required columns and the process that leads to throwing exceptions when there's an attempt to modify these columns inappropriately."
