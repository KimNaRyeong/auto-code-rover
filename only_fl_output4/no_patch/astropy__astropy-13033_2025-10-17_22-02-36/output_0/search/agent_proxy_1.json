The absence of this method in the `TimeSeries` search results points towards inheritance or shared utility methods within this core file or its relationship.\n  \n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `remove_column` method needs to check if the column being removed is listed as a required column (as `_required_columns` might be customized beyond the default and include more than just `time`). If an attempt to remove a required column is made, the method should raise a clear and specific exception stating which required column cannot be removed, rather than the current misleading message. This exception message should be something along the lines of: `ValueError: Cannot remove 'flux'; it is a required column for this TimeSeries object.` This update preserves the functionality of preventing the removal of essential data while improving clarity for the user. \n\nGiven the context and the error described in the issue, it's clear that there is a disconnect between intended protections against altering essential TimeSeries structure and the feedback provided to the user when actions violate these rules. The solution involves ensuring the method that governs column removal has an adequate check against the `_required_columns` list and communicates violations directly related to user actions."
