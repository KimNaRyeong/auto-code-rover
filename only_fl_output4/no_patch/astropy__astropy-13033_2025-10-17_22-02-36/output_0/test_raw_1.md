Here's a corrected and clarified version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from astropy.time import Time
        from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries

        time = Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')
        ts = TimeSeries(time=time, data={"flux": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})
        ts._required_columns = ["time", "flux"]                                   
        ts.remove_column("flux")
        # If we reach this point without an exception, the issue is fixed.
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        exit(1)
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue described is present (leading to a confusing exception being thrown when attempting to remove a necessary column from a `TimeSeries` object in `astropy`). The `print_stacktrace` function is used to output a detailed traceback if an exception is caught, which would help in diagnosing the problem by showing exactly where the error occurred, including any misleading exceptions being thrown by the library. When the issue is fixed, it exits with code 0, indicating the absence of the problem.
