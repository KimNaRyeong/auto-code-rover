        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how fragment identifiers are handled within the Sphinx project, and it brings us closer to understanding the root cause of the reported issue.\n\n### Analyzing Found Code Snippets\n\n#### 1. `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py` - Regular Expression Match for Fragment Identifiers\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n  This segment of code defines a regular expression (`REFURI_RE`) designed to match colons only in local fragment identifiers within an EPUB file, ensuring that external links (which might contain colons before the hash `#`) are not modified. This is critical for correctly handling internal vs. external links in generated EPUB documentation.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n  This code snippet indicates that Sphinx includes mechanisms for manipulating fragment identifiers, depending on their context (internal vs. external links). However, this particular snippet does not directly manipulate underscores or dashes in IDs. It shows that there's an existing consideration for fragment identifiers in Sphinx's EPUB builder, but not the specific underscore-to-dash behavior mentioned in the issue.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n  The intended behavior here is to accurately distinguish and process internal links within documents without altering external link references. For our issue, a similar handling or consideration may be expected for transforming function names into fragment identifiers, respecting their original formatting or providing compatibility layers.\n\n#### 2. `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py`- EpubBuilder's `write_doc` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n  It overwrites a method to write out individual document files as part of the EPUB build process. It specifically mentions fixing fragment identifiers and adding visible external links, which suggests that transformation or correction of fragment identifiers is part of the document writing process for EPUB files.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n  Although this part is focused on EPUB documentation, it explicitly mentions the intent to \"fix fragment identifiers,\" indicating a broader principle within Sphinx of modifying these identifiers. This further supports the idea that Sphinx manipulates fragment identifiers as part of its processing, which is directly related to the issue at hand\u2014though in a different context (EPUB building rather than HTML or standard documentation generation).\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n  For EPUB documentation, it's intended to ensure that fragment identifiers are correct and external links are properly marked. By analogy, when generating HTML documentation (or other formats Sphinx supports), there likely needs to be a consistent, expected representation of fragment identifiers that matches documentation linking practices (e.g., using underscores for Python functions).\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nGiven the insights and limitations of the located snippets, further investigation is needed to directly find where and how Sphinx has changed its handling of underscores to dashes in Python function names. Since the direct searches for replacing underscores with dashes yielded no results, and no specific connection to `nbsphinx` was found, it may be useful to look into the following:\n\n1. **Search for Documentation Processing Methods**: Investigate methods or classes related to documentation processing, particularly those involved in generating IDs or anchors for HTML output.\n\n   - `search_method(\"fix_ids\")`\n   - `search_method(\"write_doc\")`\n\n2. **Explore Python Domain Handling**: Given the issue's specific impact on Python functions, search for how Sphinx handles Python-specific documentation elements.\n\n   - `search_class(\"PythonDomain\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_objects\")` in the context of PythonDomain or similar classes handling Python entities within Sphinx.\n\n3. **Understand Sphinx Extension Mechanisms**: Since the behavior might be introduced via an extension or a recent change in how Sphinx itself manages identifiers, review Sphinx's extension handling code or changelogs around the mentioned issue number #7236.\n\n   - `search_code(\"extension\")`\n   - `search_code(\"#7236\")` assuming comments or documentation might reference this specific change directly.\n\nThese steps aim to uncover the specific implementation changes causing the reported issue, paving the way for designing an appropriate fix that either reverts to the old format or introduces compatibility measures for existing links."

Since the provided search results did not directly pinpoint the exact fragment identifier manipulation for Python domain objects within Sphinx, we lack a direct path to the bug location. The search results indicated handling of fragment identifiers for EPUB formats and a generic intention to \"fix\" such identifiers, pointing towards a systemic capability within Sphinx to alter these identifiers under certain conditions. However, based on the description of the bug and the understanding of Sphinx's functionality:\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**  \n  **File:** Likely in files handling HTML builder or Python domain objects processing, which were not directly revealed through the provided search results.  \n  **Class/Method:** Classes or methods responsible for generating and modifying HTML anchors based on document objects, especially for Python functions (potentially within Python domain handling).  \n  **Intended Behavior:** The code at the bug location should correctly handle Python function names by preserving underscores in the fragment identifiers for HTML links, ensuring backward compatibility with existing links (external and internal) that utilize underscores. It might involve either reversing the change that introduced dashes in place of underscores (if such a change was unintended) or providing a compatibility mode that allows for the configuration of anchor style to support underscores.\n\n- **Potential Resolution Approach:** Without direct access to or pinpointed code segments managing the transformation of Python function names into fragment identifiers, a hypothetical fix would involve identifying where Sphinx transitions function names into HTML anchors and introducing a conditional operation that either allows for the preservation of underscores or provides a setting within the Sphinx configuration to choose between underscores and dashes. This preserves existing functionality for new projects or documentation that relies on the newer format while offering backward compatibility for existing documentation and external links relying on underscores.\n  \nGiven the absence of specific file paths, class names, or method names from the search results directly related to the issue at hand, the above is a speculative approach aimed at where a fix would likely need to be implemented based on the nature of the issue described and the general behavior of Sphinx documentation generation processes. Further investigation with access to the full codebase and/or additional search results regarding Python domain object processing and HTML anchor generation in Sphinx would be necessary to precisely define the bug location(s) and intended fixes."
