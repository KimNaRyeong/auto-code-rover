        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how fragment identifiers are handled within the Sphinx project, and it brings us closer to understanding the root cause of the reported issue.\n\n### Analyzing Found Code Snippets\n\n#### 1. `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py` - Regular Expression Match for Fragment Identifiers\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n  This segment of code defines a regular expression (`REFURI_RE`) designed to match colons only in local fragment identifiers within an EPUB file, ensuring that external links (which might contain colons before the hash `#`) are not modified. This is critical for correctly handling internal vs. external links in generated EPUB documentation.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n  This code snippet indicates that Sphinx includes mechanisms for manipulating fragment identifiers, depending on their context (internal vs. external links). However, this particular snippet does not directly manipulate underscores or dashes in IDs. It shows that there's an existing consideration for fragment identifiers in Sphinx's EPUB builder, but not the specific underscore-to-dash behavior mentioned in the issue.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n  The intended behavior here is to accurately distinguish and process internal links within documents without altering external link references. For our issue, a similar handling or consideration may be expected for transforming function names into fragment identifiers, respecting their original formatting or providing compatibility layers.\n\n#### 2. `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py`- EpubBuilder's `write_doc` Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n  It overwrites a method to write out individual document files as part of the EPUB build process. It specifically mentions fixing fragment identifiers and adding visible external links, which suggests that transformation or correction of fragment identifiers is part of the document writing process for EPUB files.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n  Although this part is focused on EPUB documentation, it explicitly mentions the intent to \"fix fragment identifiers,\" indicating a broader principle within Sphinx of modifying these identifiers. This further supports the idea that Sphinx manipulates fragment identifiers as part of its processing, which is directly related to the issue at hand\u2014though in a different context (EPUB building rather than HTML or standard documentation generation).\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n  For EPUB documentation, it's intended to ensure that fragment identifiers are correct and external links are properly marked. By analogy, when generating HTML documentation (or other formats Sphinx supports), there likely needs to be a consistent, expected representation of fragment identifiers that matches documentation linking practices (e.g., using underscores for Python functions).\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nGiven the insights and limitations of the located snippets, further investigation is needed to directly find where and how Sphinx has changed its handling of underscores to dashes in Python function names. Since the direct searches for replacing underscores with dashes yielded no results, and no specific connection to `nbsphinx` was found, it may be useful to look into the following:\n\n1. **Search for Documentation Processing Methods**: Investigate methods or classes related to documentation processing, particularly those involved in generating IDs or anchors for HTML output.\n\n   - `search_method(\"fix_ids\")`\n   - `search_method(\"write_doc\")`\n\n2. **Explore Python Domain Handling**: Given the issue's specific impact on Python functions, search for how Sphinx handles Python-specific documentation elements.\n\n   - `search_class(\"PythonDomain\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_objects\")` in the context of PythonDomain or similar classes handling Python entities within Sphinx.\n\n3. **Understand Sphinx Extension Mechanisms**: Since the behavior might be introduced via an extension or a recent change in how Sphinx itself manages identifiers, review Sphinx's extension handling code or changelogs around the mentioned issue number #7236.\n\n   - `search_code(\"extension\")`\n   - `search_code(\"#7236\")` assuming comments or documentation might reference this specific change directly.\n\nThese steps aim to uncover the specific implementation changes causing the reported issue, paving the way for designing an appropriate fix that either reverts to the old format or introduces compatibility measures for existing links."

Since the provided search results did not directly pinpoint the exact fragment identifier manipulation for Python domain objects within Sphinx, we lack a direct path to the bug location. The search results indicated handling of fragment identifiers for EPUB formats and a generic intention to \"fix\" such identifiers, pointing towards a systemic capability within Sphinx to alter these identifiers under certain conditions. However, based on the description of the bug and the understanding of Sphinx's functionality:\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**  \n  **File:** Likely in files handling HTML builder or Python domain objects processing, which were not directly revealed through the provided search results.  \n  **Class/Method:** Classes or methods responsible for generating and modifying HTML anchors based on document objects, especially for Python functions (potentially within Python domain handling).  \n  **Intended Behavior:** The code at the bug location should correctly handle Python function names by preserving underscores in the fragment identifiers for HTML links, ensuring backward compatibility with existing links (external and internal) that utilize underscores. It might involve either reversing the change that introduced dashes in place of underscores (if such a change was unintended) or providing a compatibility mode that allows for the configuration of anchor style to support underscores.\n\n- **Potential Resolution Approach:** Without direct access to or pinpointed code segments managing the transformation of Python function names into fragment identifiers, a hypothetical fix would involve identifying where Sphinx transitions function names into HTML anchors and introducing a conditional operation that either allows for the preservation of underscores or provides a setting within the Sphinx configuration to choose between underscores and dashes. This preserves existing functionality for new projects or documentation that relies on the newer format while offering backward compatibility for existing documentation and external links relying on underscores.\n  \nGiven the absence of specific file paths, class names, or method names from the search results directly related to the issue at hand, the above is a speculative approach aimed at where a fix would likely need to be implemented based on the nature of the issue described and the general behavior of Sphinx documentation generation processes. Further investigation with access to the full codebase and/or additional search results regarding Python domain object processing and HTML anchor generation in Sphinx would be necessary to precisely define the bug location(s) and intended fixes."

It defines object types, directives, roles, and data related to the Python language domain, configuring how Python entities like functions, methods, classes, and modules are documented and referenced in Sphinx-generated documentation.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nGiven that the issue concerns Python function names being converted from using underscores to dashes in their fragment identifiers, the `PythonDomain` class is likely central to understanding where this behavior could originate. This is primarily because the class handles Python-specific documentation entities, which would include the notation and handling of function identifiers.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nTo address the problem described in the issue, `PythonDomain` or its related methods should ensure that Python function names are correctly translated into fragment identifiers without altering their original format (i.e., preserving underscores). This could involve logic within the domain class to generate these identifiers explicitly or to influence how they are generated elsewhere in Sphinx.\n\n### Analysis of the `fix_ids` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `fix_ids` method, found in `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py`, is used to replace colons with hyphens in `href` and `id` attributes within documents. This is done to prevent issues with some readers that might crash when interpreting these colons as part of a transport protocol specification.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nWhile the `fix_ids` method directly manipulates identifiers to ensure compatibility with EPUB readers, the issue at hand involves a similar but distinct problem of changing underscores to dashes in Python function identifiers. Although `fix_ids` is not directly related to this transformation, the method exemplifies a pattern within Sphinx of modifying HTML element identifiers for specific reasons. Understanding this pattern could be key to locating where the underscore-to-dash conversion is occurring for Python domain objects.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nIdeally, the mechanism within Sphinx that's analogous to `fix_ids` but responsible for transforming Python function names into fragment identifiers would allow for customization or preservation of underscores in identifiers. This would align with maintaining backward compatibility with existing references and links to Python documentation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe central concern revolves around how Sphinx generates and modifies fragment identifiers for Python domain objects, particularly functions. While `PythonDomain` defines the handling of these entities, the direct manipulation of identifiers might not occur within this class but under a broader scope that influences domain object processing across Sphinx. To rectify the issue, we would need to identify where Sphinx handles the conversion of object names to fragment identifiers specifically for Python functions and ensure it either preserves underscores or provides a configurable option to toggle this behavior.\n\nGiven the initial findings, further investigation is warranted, potentially focusing on the mechanisms that generate HTML content from domain objects, as these would be the most likely places where such transformations occur. This might involve reviewing the documentation and codebase for how Sphinx handles HTML anchor and identifier generation more broadly or looking at recent changes that might have introduced this behavior change."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Based on the current context and understanding of the Sphinx system from the collected information:\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**  \n  **File:** `sphinx/domains/python.py`  \n  **Class:** `PythonDomain`  \n  **Intended Behavior:** The `PythonDomain` class should ensure that when Python function names are translated to fragment identifiers, they retain their original character format, including underscores, to maintain backward compatibility with existing external and internal links. If this class or its methods directly or indirectly influence how fragment identifiers are generated (especially in converting identifiers to a web-friendly format), it should either avoid changing underscores to dashes for Python functions or provide a configurable option to dictate this behavior. This preserves the functionality of accurately referencing Python functions in the documentation while preventing the breaking of links due to identifier format changes.\n\nGiven the analysis, there's an assumption that the manipulation of identifiers might not be explicitly mentioned as converting underscores to dashes and could be part of a broader content processing system within Sphinx. Adjusting this behavior would likely involve ensuring that Python function names are either excepted from a general identifier-modification rule or that such a rule checks for configuration settings that specify how to handle these identifiers.\n\nWithout explicit code blocks or further specifics illustrating where the underscore-to-dash transformation is defined or applied to Python domain objects, it's challenging to pinpoint additional files, classes, or methods to adjust. Future steps could involve a closer review of HTML generation processes and any recent changes related to identifier handling to trace the source of this behavior accurately."
