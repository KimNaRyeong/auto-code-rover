        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `ensure_deletable` method needs to handle race conditions more gracefully. Specifically, between checking if the lock file exists (`if not lock.exists()`) and attempting to delete it (`lock.unlink()`), there's a potential for the lock file to be deleted by another process, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. An improvement would be to catch this specific exception around the `lock.unlink()` call and ignore it, as the ultimate goal (lock file removal) is already achieved by external means. This change ensures that concurrent process interactions with temporary directories do not lead to errors, preserving existing functionality while improving robustness in concurrent environments."

It should ensure that any directories created and subsequently locked are managed in a way that anticipates and mitigates potential race conditions, especially around the creation and cleanup of lock files. Detailed logging around directory and lock file creation, cleanup attempts, and failures could also be added to aid in troubleshooting similar issues. However, based on the provided information, the core intended behavior remains the creation and registration for cleanup of temporary directories without directly modifying the method but ensuring the methods it interacts with, like `cleanup_numbered_dir`, handle concurrency effectively."
