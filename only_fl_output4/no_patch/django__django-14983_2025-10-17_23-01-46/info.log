21 
22     Migration files are expected to live in the "migrations" directory of
23     an app. Their names are entirely unimportant from a code perspective,
24     but will probably follow the 1234_name.py convention.
25 
26     On initialization, this class will scan those directories, and open and
27     read the Python files, looking for a class called Migration, which should
28     inherit from django.db.migrations.Migration. See
29     django.db.migrations.migration for what that looks like.
30 
31     Some migrations will be marked as "replacing" another set of migrations.
32     These are loaded into a separate set of migrations away from the main ones.
33     If all the migrations they replace are either unapplied or missing from
34     disk, then they are injected into the main set, replacing the named migrations.
35     Any dependency pointers to the replaced migrations are re-pointed to the
36     new migration.
37 
38     This does mean that this class MUST also talk to the database as well as
39     to disk, but this is probably fine. We're already not just operating

It should ensure that when considering what the next migration number should be, it fully accounts for all existing migrations, including those that may have been squashed into a single file. The enhancement would likely involve adjusting the logic that tracks and identifies the highest current migration number, ensuring that it does not simply increment from the highest standalone migration but also considers the endpoint of squashed migrations.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py</file>

</code><intended_behavior>The adjustments needed aren't tied to a specific method discovered in our searches, suggesting the logic that determines new migration numbers is distributed or abstracted away from a single point in the code. Ideally, the process leading up to invoking `MigrationWriter` to create a new migration file should be scrutinized to ensure it accurately considers the entirety of migration history, including squashed migrations. This might involve augmenting the methodology to assess current migrations, possibly involving adjustments or enhancements in several areas including the initial gathering of migration states, processing of the migration graph to consider squashed migrations, and the final decision logic for numbering new migrations.</intended_behavior>]

20     Load migration files from disk and their status from the database.
21 
22     Migration files are expected to live in the "migrations" directory of
23     an app. Their names are entirely unimportant from a code perspective,
24     but will probably follow the 1234_name.py convention.
25 
26     On initialization, this class will scan those directories, and open and
27     read the Python files, looking for a class called Migration, which should
28     inherit from django.db.migrations.Migration. See
29     django.db.migrations.migration for what that looks like.
30 
31     Some migrations will be marked as "replacing" another set of migrations.
32     These are loaded into a separate set of migrations away from the main ones.
33     If all the migrations they replace are either unapplied or missing from
34     disk, then they are injected into the main set, replacing the named migrations.
35     Any dependency pointers to the replaced migrations are re-pointed to the
36     new migration.
37 
38     This does mean that this class MUST also talk to the database as well as
39     to disk, but this is probably fine. We're already not just operating

It should ensure that when considering what the next migration number should be, it fully accounts for all existing migrations, including those that may have been squashed into a single file. The enhancement would likely involve adjusting the logic that tracks and identifies the highest current migration number, ensuring that it does not simply increment from the highest standalone migration but also considers the endpoint of squashed migrations.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py</file>

</code><intended_behavior>The adjustments needed aren't tied to a specific method discovered in our searches, suggesting the logic that determines new migration numbers is distributed or abstracted away from a single point in the code. Ideally, the process leading up to invoking `MigrationWriter` to create a new migration file should be scrutinized to ensure it accurately considers the entirety of migration history, including squashed migrations. This might involve augmenting the methodology to assess current migrations, possibly involving adjustments or enhancements in several areas including the initial gathering of migration states, processing of the migration graph to consider squashed migrations, and the final decision logic for numbering new migrations.</intended_behavior>]
