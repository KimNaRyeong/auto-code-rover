It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively address the issue related to the Django `makemigrations` command generating incorrectly numbered migration files when squashed migrations are present, we need to gather specific context around the implementation of the migration file naming and how squashed migrations are handled. Relevant components could include code related to handling migration file names, detecting existing migrations, and generating new migration file names. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the Migration class**: This will help us understand how migration files are represented in the code. Since migration file naming is central to the issue, it's likely related to how migration objects are created or managed.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Migration\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the MigrationWriter class**: Given that new migration files are being generated with incorrect numbers, there's a writer or similar functionality responsible for creating these files. Finding this class will provide insights into the file naming process.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MigrationWriter\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the makemigrations command**: This command is directly involved in the issue. Understanding its implementation will likely reveal how it decides on the numbering of new migration files, especially in the presence of squashed migrations.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"makemigrations\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for code handling squashed migrations**: Since the issue specifically mentions behavior related to squashed migrations, finding code snippets that handle or reference squashed migrations could be insightful.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"squashed\")\n   ```\n\nThese targeted searches are aimed at uncovering the required context to understand and eventually resolve the issue around incorrectly numbered migration files in the presence of squashed migrations."
