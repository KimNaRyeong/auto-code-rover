        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals several key components and their potential relationships to the issue described. Let's break down the findings:\n\n### Migration and MigrationWriter Classes\n\n1. **MigrationWriter**: The `MigrationWriter` class is evidently responsible for serialization of migration files - that is, turning migration objects into textual migration files that Django can execute to alter the database schema. This includes generating the filename and path for new migrations.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: Since the issue revolves around the generation of an incorrectly numbered migration file, it's plausible that the logic within `MigrationWriter` or its interactions with other components to determine the next migration filename could be implicated. Specifically, how it computes `filename` could be misinterpreting or improperly accounting for squashed migrations.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, the `MigrationWriter`, when generating a filename for a new migration, should account for the existence of both standalone and squashed migration files, assigning numbers that respect the logical sequence rather than duplicating existing numbers.\n\n2. **Migration Class**: Although not directly cited in the context retrieval, it's reasonable to infer that the `Migration` class encapsulates details about individual migrations, likely including their dependencies, operations, and possibly their status as squashed or standalone migrations.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: This class could be involved in identifying existing migrations, including squashed ones, and thereby influencing how new migration numbers are generated.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: This class should accurately reflect the state and details of a migration, potentially including whether it has been superseded by a squashed migration.\n\n### makemigrations Command\n\nThe missing direct reference to a \"makemigrations\" method in the collected context suggests that the logic related to numbering new migration files might be scattered across several components involved in the migration creation process. The absence might also hint at the method being part of a larger command class or encapsulated in a way that wasn't directly identified by the search. Given the issue, it's critical to understand how this command determines the next migration number in the presence of existing and squashed migrations.\n\n### Squashed Migrations Handling\n\nThe presence of `squashed` references within key components like `loader.py`, `graph.py`, `executor.py`, and notably, the `squashmigrations` command hints at the underlying logic Django uses to manage and reckon with squashed migrations.\n\n- **Loader and Graph**: These components are likely involved in analyzing the project's migration history, determining dependencies, and understanding the overall migration path, including squashed migrations.\n- **Executor**: This is possibly where migration files are actually applied or simulated, which would necessitate awareness of squashed migrations to correctly apply dependent migrations.\n\nGiven these contexts:\n\n1. It's essential to examine how `MigrationWriter` generates filenames for new migration files, ensuring it's correctly basing its numbering on the highest existing number across both standalone and squashed migrations.\n2. Investigating how squashed migrations are recognized and factored into migration numbering logic could reveal why the bug occurs, as the issue suggests that the presence of squashed migrations is not appropriately influencing the numbering of subsequent migrations.\n3. It might be beneficial to look more closely at commands and functions related to migration creation and processing (even though the direct `makemigrations` command wasn't found), especially how they enumerate and interpret migration files.\n\nTo move forward, it would be useful to:\n- Further inspect the `MigrationWriter` class, specifically how `filename` is determined.\n- Look into the migration processing mechanism (`loader.py`, `graph.py`, and others) to understand how they interact with the `MigrationWriter` and contribute to the numbering logic. \n\nGiven the above analysis did not directly capture details on `makemigrations`, it might also be pragmatic to search for command classes or functions responsible for invoking or encompassing the `makemigrations` logic, which could be part of Django's management command infrastructure."

If a squashed migration exists (e.g., 0001_squashed_0002), the system should identify the highest numbered migration (in this case, 0002) and generate the next number based on this (e.g., 0003_auto_...). This requires possibly enhancing the logic to better parse and understand squashed migration filenames.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/db/migrations/loader.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: When loading and interpreting migration files, this component should accurately identify and factor in squashed migrations when determining what the next migration number should be. It may involve modifying how migration dependencies are resolved and ensuring that the presence of a squashed migration correctly influences the naming of subsequent migrations. This could mean improving how migrations are enumerated and ensuring that squashed migrations do not disrupt the numerical ordering of new migrations.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors are predicted based on the current understanding of the problem and the Django migrations system.

        "content": "The collected context provides insight into the components and mechanisms that could be relevant to the issue with Django's `makemigrations` and handling of squashed migrations. Let's analyze the provided excerpts:\n\n### MigrationWriter's `filename` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `filename` method in `MigrationWriter` is responsible for constructing the filename of a migration. It formats the migration name (which likely includes the migration number and description) into a filename by appending `.py`.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**\n   - Since the issue involves the generation of incorrectly numbered migration files, this method is crucial because it directly influences the migration file's name. However, the method itself does not decide on the numbering; it simply formats what it is given. This suggests the computation or logic that assigns the migration name (including its number) occurs before this point.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - Although this method correctly formats the migration name into a filename, the intended behavior regarding the issue would involve ensuring that the migration name provided to this method already correctly accounts for squashed migrations. This indication means looking upstream at how migration names and numbers are generated or decided upon before reaching this point.\n\n\n### MigrationLoader's Handling of Squashed Migrations\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - Within `MigrationLoader`, specifically in the method `check_consistent_history`, there's logic to handle unapplied squashed migrations by checking if all migrations that a squashed migration replaces are applied.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**\n   - This piece of the system is aware of squashed migrations and their relationship to other migrations. Understanding how squashed migrations are handled here provides a clue about how they might be factored (or not) into generating new migration numbers. The issue could stem from the way new migration numbers are generated without adequately considering the existence or state of squashed migrations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - To address the issue, the system should ensure that when considering whether to generate a new migration as `0002_auto_...` or `0003_auto_...`, it correctly interprets the presence and implications of any squashed migrations. This might involve enhancing how squashed migrations and their replacements are factored into determining the latest migration number before creating a new one.\n\n### Django's Migration Graph Handling of Squashed Migrations\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `DummyNode` class represents a node that doesn't correspond to a migration file on disk, which includes squashed migrations that have been removed. This is significant in how the migration graph is processed, ensuring dependencies are tracked correctly even for migrations that no longer exist as separate files.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**\n   - The management and tracking of squashed migrations within the migration graph are essential for properly generating migration files with the correct numbering. If squashed migrations are not properly accounted for, it could lead to the generation of migration files with numbers that incorrectly reflect the current state of the application's migrations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - The migration graph, including how dummy nodes are handled, must ensure that the effects of squashed migrations are appropriately considered in the overall migration landscape. This could affect the numbering of new migrations, particularly ensuring that such numbering accurately reflects both existing and squashed migrations.\n\n**In summary**, the resolution to the issue likely involves ensuring that the process leading up to the generation of migration filenames correctly accounts for all types of migrations, including those that have been squashed. This means potentially adjusting how squashed migrations are tracked and considered in the numbering of new migrations, which may involve changes in how migrations are loaded, how their dependencies are interpreted, and how squashed migrations are integrated into the migration history and graph."

It should ensure that when considering what the next migration number should be, it fully accounts for all existing migrations, including those that may have been squashed into a single file. The enhancement would likely involve adjusting the logic that tracks and identifies the highest current migration number, ensuring that it does not simply increment from the highest standalone migration but also considers the endpoint of squashed migrations.\n\n2. **Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`\n   - **Description:** Although direct references to a `makemigrations` command implementation weren't found, it's understood that this is part of Django's command infrastructure for migrations. The issue seems to stem from how this command interacts with the migration history to decide on new migration numbers.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The adjustments needed aren't tied to a specific method discovered in our searches, suggesting the logic that determines new migration numbers is distributed or abstracted away from a single point in the code. Ideally, the process leading up to invoking `MigrationWriter` to create a new migration file should be scrutinized to ensure it accurately considers the entirety of migration history, including squashed migrations. This might involve augmenting the methodology to assess current migrations, possibly involving adjustments or enhancements in several areas including the initial gathering of migration states, processing of the migration graph to consider squashed migrations, and the final decision logic for numbering new migrations.\n\nBoth locations indicate the issue likely stems from a systemic oversight rather than a singular, isolated bug. The intended behavior highlights the need for a comprehensive consideration of all migration types during the new migration number generation process, ensuring that the system remains coherent and consistent, especially in complex migration landscapes with squashed migrations."
