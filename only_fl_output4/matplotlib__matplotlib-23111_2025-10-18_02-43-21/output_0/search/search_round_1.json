        "content": "Based on the returned search results, let's analyze the context and its relation to the bug:\n\n1. **_g_sig_digits function in cbook/__init__.py:**\n   - This function aims to return the number of significant digits for formatting a value, given a specified error margin (`delta`). The significant part of this function that wasn't captured in the snippet concerns how it handles the `delta` variable, especially since the bug is related to a math domain error possibly due to a negative or zero `delta` being used in a logarithm operation.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** The issue likely arises within this function when calling `math.log10(delta)` with a `delta` that is less than or equal to zero, which is not allowed as `math.log10` requires positive numbers. In the bug description, it's hypothesized that `delta` might be negative when all values in the array are negative and identical, which leads to this math error upon interacting with the image plot.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, `_g_sig_digits` should either handle non-positive `delta` values gracefully, without causing a domain error or ensure that its call sites prevent non-positive values from being passed to it.\n\n2. **mouse_move in lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py:**\n   - This method updates the cursor and sets the message for display when the mouse is moved over a matplotlib rendering. The code snippet includes calls to update the cursor (`_update_cursor`) and potentially format messages about the data under the cursor (`_mouse_event_to_message`).\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Since the bug occurs when hovering over the displayed image, it's likely related to how `mouse_move` (or methods it calls) interacts with the plot data. Specifically, formatting the cursor data to display (which could involve calculating deltas for significant digits) might be where negative `delta` values come into play, leading to the unhandled scenario in `_g_sig_digits`.\n   - **Intended behavior:** During mouse movement over a plotted image, particularly one with uniform, negative values, it should correctly display cursor data without throwing errors, by calculating or handling `delta` values in a way that avoids domain errors.\n\nGiven the findings, further steps should include understanding how `delta` is calculated before being passed to `_g_sig_digits` and ensuring it's always positive when passed to mathematical operations like `log10`. Additionally, there might be a need to look at `_mouse_event_to_message` and how it interacts with plotting data to provide cursor messages, as this is likely where `delta` is generated and processed. It also becomes clear that there's a gap in understanding exactly how `delta` is being used and generated \u2013 a point that requires further investigation:\n\n- Investigate how `delta` is calculated and used within `_mouse_event_to_message` or related methods that precede the call to `_g_sig_digits`.\n- Understanding the workflow from `mouse_move` to `_g_sig_digits` could pinpoint where negative or zero `delta` values are sourced from."
