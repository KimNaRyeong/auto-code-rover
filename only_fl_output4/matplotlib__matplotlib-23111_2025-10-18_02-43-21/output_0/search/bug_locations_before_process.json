        "intended_behavior": "The `_g_sig_digits` function should be modified to handle cases where `delta` is less than or equal to zero. This can be achieved by adding a check before the logarithm operation to ensure `delta` is positive. If `delta` is non-positive, the function could either return a default significant digit value (such as 0) or adjust `delta` to a minimum positive threshold value to allow the log operation to proceed without throwing a domain error. This change preserves the existing functionality of determining significant digits while preventing math domain errors."

        "method": "_mouse_event_to_message",
        "intended_behavior": "The intention within `_mouse_event_to_message` is to safely and correctly display cursor data, including when encountering unusual data conditions such as uniform negative values. While the method itself may not directly calculate `delta` or significant digits, it should ensure any invocation of methods that do, such as indirectly calling `_g_sig_digits` through `format_cursor_data`, are robust against data that could lead to errors. This could involve pre-validating data or post-processing format results to catch and handle exceptions. Ensuring robustness in how data values are handled before they lead to errors would address the issue without altering the method's primary functionality of presenting cursor information."
