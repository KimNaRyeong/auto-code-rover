        "intended_behavior": "This function should explicitly specify which database to use when calling `transaction.atomic()` in a multi-database setup, especially when there's no default database configured. This could be done by either detecting the appropriate database for `Permission` model updates or allowing for manual specification as part of the migration's parameters. The update operation within this transaction (`Permission.objects.filter(...).update(...)`) should also ensure it targets the correct database. This ensures the migration can run without errors in environments where the default database is not set or when different databases are used for different models."
