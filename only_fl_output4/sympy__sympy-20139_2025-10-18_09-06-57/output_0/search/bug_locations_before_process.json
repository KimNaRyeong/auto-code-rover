        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method of the `MatrixSymbol` class should be modified to ensure that the `name` parameter is explicitly converted to a string if it is not already one. This involves adding a check or a conversion operation within the `__new__` method to take the input `name` and ensure it is treated as a string throughout the lifetime of the `MatrixSymbol` instance. This change must preserve the functionality of the `MatrixSymbol`, such as being able to participate in symbolic matrix operations, being identified uniquely within expressions, and interacting correctly with the rest of the SymPy library that may operate on the `name` attribute. Additionally, this change should not disrupt any existing features or expected behaviors of the `MatrixSymbol` class, including its properties and methods that use the name, its serialization, or its display representation. This adjustment will align the implementation with the issue's requirement, ensuring that `MatrixSymbol`'s first argument, the `name`, is stored and handled as a string, contributing to a more consistent and expected behavior when dealing with symbolic matrix names within the library."
