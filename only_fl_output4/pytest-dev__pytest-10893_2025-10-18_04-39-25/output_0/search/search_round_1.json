Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

Context from `_pytest/pathlib.py` regarding `rmtree`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `on_rm_rf_error` function is designed to handle known read-only errors during `rmtree`, possibly intended to catch and handle exceptions that occur when attempting to remove files or directories that are read-only.\n- The `rm_rf` function removes the contents of a path recursively, even if some elements are read-only, by calling `shutil.rmtree` with a custom `onerror` handler (in this case, `on_rm_rf_error`). \n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The use of `shutil.rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter in `rm_rf` directly relates to the first part of the issue. Python 3.12's deprecation of the `onerror` parameter in favor of `onexc` causes a `DeprecationWarning` when this code is executed under the latest Python alpha version.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- Ideally, the `rm_rf` function should continue to remove paths recursively without errors, handling read-only files or permission errors gracefully, even after updating to adhere to the new `onexc` parameter in Python 3.12.\n\n### 2. Context from `TestCaseFunction` in `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `TestCaseFunction` class, inheriting from `Function`, appears to be Pytest's integration point with Python's `unittest` framework, handling the setup, teardown, and execution of a test case defined using `unittest`. It includes methods for adding errors, failures, skips, and other outcomes to the test results.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- This context is relevant to the second part of the issue: the missing `addDuration` method. Since Python 3.12 introduces a requirement for test result objects to have an `addDuration` method, the absence of such a method in `TestCaseFunction` results in a warning that becomes an error under certain configurations.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- To comply with Python 3.12's new test protocol, `TestCaseFunction` should implement an `addDuration` method that logs the duration of a test case's execution without causing any backward compatibility issues.\n\nGiven this analysis, addressing the issue requires modifying both `rm_rf` to replace the `onerror` callback with the new `onexc` callback in accordance with Python 3.12's changes and adding an `addDuration` method to the `TestCaseFunction` class to avoid warnings about missing this method when running tests under Python 3.12."

Bug locations and intended behaviors:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`\n- Class: N/A\n- Method: `rm_rf`\n  \n**Intended Behavior:**\nUpdate the `rm_rf` method to support the change in Python 3.12 alpha by replacing the `shutil.rmtree` usage with the `onerror` parameter to use `onexc` parameter instead. This update must ensure that the method continues to remove paths recursively, handling read-only files or permission errors without causing `DeprecationWarning` in Python 3.12, preserving compatibility with previous Python versions if necessary. This may involve conditionally checking the Python version and deciding which parameter to use or abstracting the error handling in a way compatible with both pre- and post-deprecation environments.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n- Class: `TestCaseFunction`\n  \n**Intended Behavior:**\nImplement a new method `addDuration` in the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method should record the duration of test execution. The implementation must ensure that `TestCaseFunction` can accept and correctly handle duration data without impacting its integration with the `unittest` framework. The method should meet the expectations of Python 3.12's test result protocol, which requires this method for test result objects, thereby preventing warnings or errors due to its absence when tests are run under Python 3.12 with warnings treated as errors. This method should also not interfere with the existing functionalities of the `TestCaseFunction` class or disrupt tests running under versions of Python earlier than 3.12."
