Use of `rmtree` causes `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.12 alpha
The current Python 3.12 alpha has made a change to `rmtree` https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102828, deprecating the `onerror` parameter and replacing it with an `onexc` parameter. Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.
Add `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`
cpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).

This would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.

Now obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.
