        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us insights into the current state of the implementation related to the `Round` function in Django and how it may be improved to address the issue submitted.\n\n### Analysis of `Round` Class in `django/db/models/functions/math.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Round` class defined in `math.py` is a subclass of `Transform`, indicating it's used to perform a transformation on the data\u2014specifically, it rounds numerical values. The class attributes suggest that it uses the SQL `ROUND` function in its operation.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The issue pointed out that Django's `Round` function does not support rounding to a specified precision, which is a limitation given that the underlying databases do support such functionality. The current implementation of the `Round` class corroborates this, as it does not show any mechanism for accepting or handling a precision argument.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  Based on the issue description, the improved `Round` class should accept an optional precision argument that specifies the number of decimal places to which the value should be rounded. This would require changing the implementation to handle and pass this argument to the underlying database function.\n\n### Analysis of `Func` Usage\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Func` class is used throughout the Django ORM to represent SQL functions. The wide range of files having references to it suggests it acts as a base for creating a variety of SQL function expressions, including mathematical operations, string manipulations, and more.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The custom workaround shared in the issue description leverages a class inheriting from `Func` to implement the needed behavior. It implies that correctly extending or modifying `Func` or its subclasses could offer a way to introduce precision handling in `Round`.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  For the issue at hand, any modification or extension involving `Func` should facilitate inserting a precision argument into the generated SQL expressions for rounding operations.\n\n### Analysis of `ROUND` Usage\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  References to the `ROUND` function in various files likely represent specific allocations of SQL's `ROUND` in different contexts, for example, templates or database backend operations.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  These references indicate where and how Django's codebase interacts with the SQL `ROUND` function. Specifically, understanding these usages might reveal patterns or established practices for incorporating SQL functions and their arguments, which could be applied to enhance the `Round` class.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  While these snippets might not directly contribute to solving the issue, recognizing how Django projects typically manage SQL function arguments can inform the approach for adding precision argument support to the `Round` function.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe analysis suggests an initiative to modify the `Round` class definition in `django/db/models/functions/math.py` to accept and properly process a precision argument. Additionally, understanding the broader usage of `Func` and SQL functions within Django could provide insights into implementing this feature in a way that's congruent with existing patterns in the codebase.\n\nGiven the identified location of the `Round` class and its current capabilities, the next step should involve detailed examination and potential modification of this class to support the precision parameter, keeping in mind the compatibility across Django's supported databases."

This argument must be handled in such a way that it constructs the appropriate SQL query based on the backend being used (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle) to utilize the native `ROUND` function's capability of accepting precision. The change must ensure that:\n    - If a precision argument is provided, it is used to round the value to the specified number of decimal places across all supported database backends.\n    - If no precision argument is provided, the behavior defaults to rounding to the nearest integer, preserving the current functionality for backward compatibility.\n    - The modification considers the compatibility with Django\u2019s ORM and does not break the existing API contracts of the `Round` class."
