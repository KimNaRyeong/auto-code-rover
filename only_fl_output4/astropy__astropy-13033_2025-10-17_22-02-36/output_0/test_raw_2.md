Certainly! Here is an adjusted `reproducer.py` script following your instructions. This script checks for the problematic behavior as described and uses the `print_stacktrace` function accurately to ensure clear visibility of where errors occur.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from astropy.time import Time
        from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries

        # Create a TimeSeries object with additional required columns
        time = Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')
        ts = TimeSeries(time=time, data={"flux": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})
        ts._required_columns = ["time", "flux"]

        # Attempt to remove a required column
        ts.remove_column("flux")

        # If the above operation does not raise an exception, the issue persists
        print("The expected exception was not raised.")
        exit(1)

    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) == "TimeSeries object is invalid - expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'":
            # The specific misleading exception is caught
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
        else:
            # If another ValueError is caught, let's report it properly
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)

    except Exception as e:
        # For all other exceptions, print the stack trace and indicate failure.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        exit(1)
    except SystemExit as se:
        exit(se.code)
```

This script does the following:
- It imports the necessary modules and sets up a `TimeSeries` object as described in your scenario.
- It sets `ts._required_columns` to include both `"time"` and `"flux"`, and then tries to remove the `"flux"` column.
- If the deletion of the required column fails with a `ValueError` with a specific misleading message, an `AssertionError` is raised to indicate that the issue is present.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print detailed information about the traceback if an unexpected exception is caught.
- It correctly exits with code 1 if the expected exception is caught (indicating the issue is present) and with system exit code from `SystemExit` exceptions which could be a result of `exit(0)` indicating the issue has been fixed.
