        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, we must adjust the implementation of the `randMatrix` method to ensure that when generating a symmetric matrix with a specified `percent` value for sparsity, the symmetry of the matrix is preserved regardless of the sparsity level. The revised behavior should:\n\n  - Identify the upper triangle of the matrix, including the diagonal, to populate with random non-zero values according to the specified `percent` sparsity.\n  - For each non-zero value placed in the upper triangle, the corresponding symmetric value in the lower triangle must be set to the same value to maintain symmetry.\n  - Adjust the calculation and assignment of zero and non-zero elements to cater to both the upper and lower parts of the matrix simultaneously, thereby preserving the symmetry post sparsity application.\n  - This approach ensures that if a matrix cell `[i, j]` is set to be non-zero or zero, its symmetric cell `[j, i]` mirrors this without directly shuffling all matrix elements, which could disrupt the symmetry for sparsity levels other than 100%.\n\nBy implementing these adjustments, the `randMatrix` function will accurately generate symmetric matrices at various levels of sparsity, adhering to the user's expectations and the documentation's promises."
