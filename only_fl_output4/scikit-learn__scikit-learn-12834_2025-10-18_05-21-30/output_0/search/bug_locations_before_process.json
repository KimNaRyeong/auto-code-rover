        "intended_behavior": "The method needs to be adapted to properly handle string labels for dependent variables (DVs). Specifically, when predicting class labels, it should identify whether the DVs are numeric or strings and, in case of strings, apply an appropriate mechanism for determining the modal (most frequent) label across the tree predictions rather than using np.argmax which is applicable for numeric predictions. This adaptation must ensure that functionality for numeric DVs remains unaffected, thereby preserving existing behavior while extending support for string DVs."

        "intended_behavior": "While this method primarily outputs numeric probabilities and may not need significant changes for handling string DVs, it is crucial to ensure that any post-processing or mapping of probabilities to class labels (if applicable within or after this method) considers the string nature of DVs. The method's behavior for numeric DVs should remain unchanged, ensuring that probability estimates are correctly computed and associated with the corresponding string labels without attempting to convert these labels into numeric types."

Given it computes log probabilities, the method itself might not require changes for handling string DVs directly. However, ensuring that the computed log probabilities are correctly associated with string labels and that there's no implicit expectation for the labels to be numeric is crucial. The existing functionality for numeric labels should be preserved."
