</code><intended_behavior>The intended behavior for resolving the issue in the `replace_with_arrays` method is to modify it so that the `indices` parameter becomes optional. This would involve allowing the method call without specifying indices, in which case a default behavior should be assumed. The exact default behavior isn't specified in the issue description, therefore a reasonable approach might be:

- When `indices` is not provided, the method could either assume no specific ordering, meaning it could default to using the order of tensors as they appear in `replacement_dict`, or it might use a natural ordering based on the tensor keys if that proves more intuitive for users.
- The functionality should otherwise remain unchanged, supporting the same operations and checks as it currently does when `indices` is explicitly provided, ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.
- A check should be added to handle the scenario when `indices` is None. This involves setting a default value for indices at the start of the method or incorporating logical checks throughout the method to operate correctly even when `indices` is not provided.
- It is crucial that this update does not alter the method's behavior when `indices` is provided, to ensure that existing calls to the method do not break due to this change.

To implement this, one might start by updating the method signature to set a default value for `indices`, for example, `indices=None`. This would be followed by adjusting the logic within the method to handle the case when `indices` is `None`, deciding on how to proceed without explicit index guidance.</intended_behavior>, <file>sympy/tensor/tensor.py</file>

2113     def replace_with_arrays(self, replacement_dict, indices):
2114         """
2115         Replace the tensorial expressions with arrays. The final array will
2116         correspond to the N-dimensional array with indices arranged according
2117         to ``indices``.
2118 
2119         Parameters
2120         ==========
2121 
2122         replacement_dict
2123             dictionary containing the replacement rules for tensors.
2124         indices
2125             the index order with respect to which the array is read.
2126 
2127         Examples
2128         ========
2129 
2130         >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import TensorIndexType, tensor_indices
2131         >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import tensorhead
2132         >>> from sympy import symbols, diag
2133 
2134         >>> L = TensorIndexType("L")
2135         >>> i, j = tensor_indices("i j", L)
2136         >>> A = tensorhead("A", [L], [[1]])
2137         >>> A(i).replace_with_arrays({A(i): [1, 2]}, [i])
2138         [1, 2]
2139         >>> expr = A(i)*A(j)
2140         >>> expr.replace_with_arrays({A(i): [1, 2]}, [i, j])
2141         [[1, 2], [2, 4]]
2142 
2143         For contractions, specify the metric of the ``TensorIndexType``, which
2144         in this case is ``L``, in its covariant form:
2145 
2146         >>> expr = A(i)*A(-i)
2147         >>> expr.replace_with_arrays({A(i): [1, 2], L: diag(1, -1)}, [])
2148         -3
2149 
2150         Symmetrization of an array:
2151 
2152         >>> H = tensorhead("H", [L, L], [[1], [1]])
2153         >>> a, b, c, d = symbols("a b c d")
2154         >>> expr = H(i, j)/2 + H(j, i)/2
2155         >>> expr.replace_with_arrays({H(i, j): [[a, b], [c, d]]}, [i, j])
2156         [[a, b/2 + c/2], [b/2 + c/2, d]]
2157 
2158         Anti-symmetrization of an array:
2159 
2160         >>> expr = H(i, j)/2 - H(j, i)/2
2161         >>> repl = {H(i, j): [[a, b], [c, d]]}
2162         >>> expr.replace_with_arrays(repl, [i, j])
2163         [[0, b/2 - c/2], [-b/2 + c/2, 0]]
2164 
2165         The same expression can be read as the transpose by inverting ``i`` and
2166         ``j``:
2167 
2168         >>> expr.replace_with_arrays(repl, [j, i])
2169         [[0, -b/2 + c/2], [b/2 - c/2, 0]]
