simplify doesn't do the last simplification step

I've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step. 

I've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial 

expression is still huge (675 ops!):

A first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :

Which is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):

If simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`  

From my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early. 

I fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:

``` python
def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):
    """
    Simplifies the given expression.

    Input
    ========
    max_rec_steps: int
        if >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'
        times.

    (...)

    """

    (...)

    if measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):
        expr = original_expr

    if max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):
        sexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)
        expr = shorter(expr,sexpr)        

    return expr

```

I can make the pull request if that helps.
