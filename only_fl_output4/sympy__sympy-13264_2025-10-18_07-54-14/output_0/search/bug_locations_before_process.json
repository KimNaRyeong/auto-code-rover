        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` function should accept an additional argument, `max_rec_steps` (defaulting to 0 for backward compatibility), indicating the maximum number of recursive simplification steps to perform. If `max_rec_steps > 0`, the function will attempt to apply further simplifications up to the specified number of times or until no further simplification is achieved.\n\nThe intended behavior incorporates:\n- An additional parameter in the function signature for controlling the depth of recursive simplification.\n- A recursive mechanism that checks if the simplified expression could be simplified further, decrementing the `max_rec_steps` counter with each recursive call.\n- A base case where the function stops recursing either when `max_rec_steps` reaches 0 or when further calls to `simplify` yield no further simplification (i.e., when the operation count or some other complexity measure of the expression does not decrease).\n- Preserving the existing functionality of the code by ensuring that if `max_rec_steps` is not specified or is 0, the function behaves exactly as before, maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nThis enhancement aims to allow users to specify the depth of the simplification process explicitly, potentially avoiding the need for manual, repeated calls to the `simplify` function to achieve a deeper simplification."
