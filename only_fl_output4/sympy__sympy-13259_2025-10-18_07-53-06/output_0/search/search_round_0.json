Look into the `simplify()` method, which is being called on a trigonometric expression. This will help us understand how `simplify()` processes trigonometric functions with complex arguments.\n\n2. Investigate the classes or modules where trigonometric functions (`cos`, `cosh`, and `asinh`) are defined or handled. Specifically, we need to understand how these functions are being transformed during the simplification process.\n\nGiven these points, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the method `simplify()` to find out in which file and part of the codebase it's implemented.\n\n2. Search for the classes where trigonometric functions like `cos`, `cosh`, and `asinh` are likely implemented or handled.\n\n3. Once we identify the method and classes, further investigation might be needed based on the results from these initial searches.\n\nFirst round of API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`\n- `search_class(\"cos\")`\n- `search_class(\"cosh\")`\n- `search_class(\"asinh\")`"
