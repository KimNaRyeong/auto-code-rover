Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested.

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we must locate where `__isnull` lookups are processed or validated within the codebase. Given that `__isnull` is mentioned in the context of database queries and considering the nature of the issue, it seems likely related to an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or database query interface.\n\n1. To find where `__isnull` lookups are initially defined or handled, we might start by searching for `__isnull` directly in the code to understand its usage patterns or to locate relevant validator functions or classes:\n   - `search_code(\"__isnull\")`\n\n2. Since the issue suggests that an error should be raised for non-boolean values, we should look for any existing validation methods or query parameter processing functions that might be relevant to incorporate this new validation logic. This means identifying methods or classes responsible for processing query lookups or validations:\n   - `search_method(\"validate_lookup\")`\n   - `search_method(\"process_lookup\")`\n\n3. Given the nature of ORMs or query frameworks often having classes dedicated to representing query components or field lookups, we should attempt to locate such classes which might be directly involved with `__isnull` or lookup processing in general. If there's a known class or module pattern for handling lookups or conditions in the ORM/query framework being used, it's a good place to enforce the boolean value constraint for `__isnull`:\n   - `search_class(\"Lookup\")`\n   - `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n   - `search_class(\"FieldLookup\")`\n\nThese API calls should help us gather enough context to begin understanding how `__isnull` is currently used and where we may need to introduce changes to enforce the described constraint."
