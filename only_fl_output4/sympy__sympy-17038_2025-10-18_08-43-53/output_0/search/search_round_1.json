        "content": "<issue>isqrt gives incorrect results\nThe `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:\n```\n>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt\n>>> n = 4503599761588224\n>>> s = isqrt(n)\n>>> s  # correct result is 67108864\n67108865\n>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True\nFalse\n```\nor\n```\n>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999\n100000000\n```\nVersions: Python 3.7.3, SymPy 1.4, macOS 10.14.5\n## Analysis\nFor small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):\n```\nif n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\nreturn int(_sqrt(n))\n```\nThe main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.\n*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.\nIf we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of \"smallish\" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)\nWhether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.\nIn the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.\nI guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.\n</issue>"

This approach relies on the floating-point square root operation.\n- For larger `n`, it falls back to `integer_nthroot(int(n), 2)[0]`, which likely uses a more precise method for computing the integer square root without relying on floating-point operations.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug:**\n\n- The issue arises when floating-point inaccuracies manifest due to the limits of precision within the floating-point representation, specifically with very large numbers. The examples provided in the issue demonstrate situations where the direct application of `math.sqrt` followed by a truncation to an integer produces incorrect results.\n- The threshold `17984395633462800708566937239552` represents a boundary above which the current implementation does not trust the floating-point computation to be accurate, switching instead to an algorithm that doesn't rely on floating-point arithmetic for larger numbers.\n\n3. **Intended behavior and relation to the bug:**\n\n- Given the problem at hand, the intended behavior for `isqrt` is to consistently return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, regardless of the magnitude of `n`. This means it should correctly handle edge cases brought about by floating-point imprecision.\n- The bug effectively highlights a miscalculation in defining the safe operational boundary for floating-point square root operations. Specifically, it questions the correctness of the boundary `17984395633462800708566937239552` and suggests that it may be set too high, considering the inaccuracies that surface at much lower values of `n`.\n\nIn summary, to resolve the bug, a revised approach should reconsider the threshold used to switch between direct floating-point square root computation and the integer-only algorithmic approach. The issue description provides a reasoning pathway that could involve adjusting this threshold based on the assumptions regarding the accuracy of Python's `math.sqrt` and the nature of floating-point representations, potentially requiring a dynamical check of the square root's correctness for values around the problematic boundary."

According to the analysis and the issue description, the threshold for switching between `math.sqrt` for floating-point and `integer_nthroot` for integer calculations is currently set too high, allowing inaccuracies in calculations for numbers that are actually within the range where floating-point inaccuracies affect the result. To resolve the issue, the threshold `17984395633462800708566937239552` should be reduced to `4503599761588224` (`2**52 + 2**27`), which is suggested as the largest number that can be safely used for floating-point square root operations to avoid inaccuracies due to the limits of floating-point precision. Furthermore, after using `_sqrt(n)` to compute the square root, the code should perform a check to ensure the squared result does not exceed `n`, providing a correction mechanism for cases where floating-point imprecision leads to an incorrect square root approximation. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality for numbers where floating-point computation is accurate while improving the correctness for edge-case numbers highlighted in the issue."
