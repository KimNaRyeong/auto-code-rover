        "intended_behavior": "The current implementation of `isqrt` needs to adjust its threshold for utilizing the `math.sqrt` function directly. According to the analysis and the issue description, the threshold for switching between `math.sqrt` for floating-point and `integer_nthroot` for integer calculations is currently set too high, allowing inaccuracies in calculations for numbers that are actually within the range where floating-point inaccuracies affect the result. To resolve the issue, the threshold `17984395633462800708566937239552` should be reduced to `4503599761588224` (`2**52 + 2**27`), which is suggested as the largest number that can be safely used for floating-point square root operations to avoid inaccuracies due to the limits of floating-point precision. Furthermore, after using `_sqrt(n)` to compute the square root, the code should perform a check to ensure the squared result does not exceed `n`, providing a correction mechanism for cases where floating-point imprecision leads to an incorrect square root approximation. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality for numbers where floating-point computation is accurate while improving the correctness for edge-case numbers highlighted in the issue."
