Given a specific file path is mentioned in the issue description, it's wise to verify and see more of the context around the current implementation for any potential improvements or adjustments.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/core/power.py\", 23, 10)`\n\n3. The issue description also provides a specific bound (`17984395633462800708566937239552`) used to decide the computation method.
