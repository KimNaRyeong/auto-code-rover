        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location is to correct the guidance provided in the hint to developers configuring many-to-many relationships. This involves two main corrections:\n1. Updating the hint to correctly reference `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey`: The erroneous suggestion of using `ForeignKey` with parameters `symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"` should be replaced with accurate instructions referring to configuring a `ManyToManyField` for recursive relationships. This means rephrasing the hint to guide users towards using `ManyToManyField` with the appropriate parameters for setting up such a relationship.\n2. Clarifying the relevance of `symmetrical=False`: Given that setting `symmetrical=False` is no longer required for recursive relationships with an intermediary model since Django 3.0, the hint should omit this outdated requirement. If it's considered necessary to mention it for users working with versions prior to Django 3.0, it should be clearly annotated as such, to avoid confusion for developers working with newer versions of Django.\n\nThe correction ensures that developers receive accurate and helpful guidance when configuring many-to-many relationships in Django, particularly in advanced scenarios involving recursive relationships and intermediary models. It retains the functionality of the `_check_relationship_model` method in validating the setup of `ManyToManyField` but with updated and correct information."
