When dealing with test files that are outside the invocation directory, the intended behavior should include prepending the relative path (e.g., `../`) to make sure the displayed path accurately reflects the file's location relative to the directory where `pytest` was called. The modification should ensure that this handling does not affect other functionalities, such as the display of paths that are not outside the invocation directory.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2:** File: `src/_pytest/runner.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If this file contains logic for generating the skipped test reports (directly affecting the output format of skipped test paths), it should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that test paths are correctly formatted relative to the invocation directory. This involves ensuring that paths are correctly calculated and displayed, taking into account `rootdir` and the invocation directory, preserving existing functionalities related to test reporting and handling of paths within or below the invocation directory. \n\nThese locations are hypothesized based on the provided information and the logical flow of where the issue description points to. The modification in these parts of the code should aim to preserve the way `pytest` handles paths internally, adjusting only how they are displayed to the user in the context of skipped tests. The ultimate goal is to ensure paths are intuitive and accurately reflect the file system structure relative to the invocation point, thereby resolving the confusion or misleading information presented in the current behavior."
