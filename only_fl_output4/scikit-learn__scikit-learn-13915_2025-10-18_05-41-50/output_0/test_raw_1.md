Certainly, below is an updated attempt to create a `reproducer.py` that adheres to your constraints and utilizes the provided function for a coherent stack trace upon encountering the described issue. Note that this script particularly aims at triggering the `TypeError` described when using large CSC matrices with `int64` index types on a 32-bit Windows Python environment as described in your issue documentation.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis

    # Attempt to simulate conditions that might expose the issue.
    try:
        # Creating a csc_matrix with int64 indices to match the test conditions.
        X = sp.csc_matrix(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
        X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

        # Running the method that's expected to fail under described conditions.
        min_val, max_val = min_max_axis(X, 0)

        # If the operation succeeds without TypeError, validate the results.
        assert min_val[0] == 1 and max_val[0] == 3, "Expected min and max values do not match."

        # Reaching this point without exception means the issue was not reproduced.
        print("Issue not present. The function executed as expected.")

    except AssertionError as assertError:
        # For assertion errors, we simply print the message.
        print(f"AssertionError: {assertError}")
    except Exception as generalError:
        # For any other exceptions, particularly TypeError, we use the print_stacktrace method.
        print_stacktrace(generalError)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script intentionally triggers conditions similar to those described in the issue. When executed, it should:

- Proceed without any errors if the problem has been fixed or does not exist in the executing environment, printing a confirmation message to stdout.
- Use the provided `print_stacktrace` method to print detailed error information if the test case results in a `TypeError`, or an `AssertionError` is caught due to unexpected min and max values.

Please make sure that your operational setup meets the conditions (specifically, Python 3.5.4 32-bit on Windows) for the problem to manifest as described.
