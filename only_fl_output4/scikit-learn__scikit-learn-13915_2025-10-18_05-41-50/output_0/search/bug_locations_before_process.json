        "intended_behavior": "This function should safely handle indices of the sparse matrix (`X.indptr`) regardless of the system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). To resolve the issue, the method needs to ensure that operations on `X.indptr` are compatible with the platform's integer size. This might involve explicitly checking the dtype of `X.indptr` and converting it to 'int32' on a 32-bit system, with careful handling to prevent data loss (for example, ensuring that the indices values do not exceed the maximum value representable by 'int32'). Additionally, there should be a check that throws a more descriptive error if the conversion or operation cannot be safely performed due to the risk of data loss. The fix must preserve the existing functionality of computing min and max for both CSR and CSC sparse matrices efficiently and accurately, without introducing significant performance degradation."
