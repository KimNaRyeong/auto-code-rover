In this script, `reproducer.py`, the function `main` attempts to reproduce the issue described. The matrices `X` (csc_matrix) and `Y` (csr_matrix) both have their `indptr` arrays converted to `int64`. The script then tests the function `min_max_axis` from `sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs` on both matrices and checks if the operation is successful.

- If an `AssertionError` is caught, it means that the issue is related to an unexpected result rather than the specific `TypeError` described. However, the primary aim here is to catch exceptions that would indicate the presence of the bug described in the issue (specifically, a `TypeError` that arises from an invalid cast operation).
  
- If any other exception occurs (which in this scenario would likely be the `TypeError` discussed), we catch it, print the stack trace for detailed debugging information, and then re-raise the exception to signify the script encounters a problem.

- The script is designed to follow the guideline provided: exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed (expected normal execution path without exceptions) and printing a detailed stack trace of the issue if it is still present.
