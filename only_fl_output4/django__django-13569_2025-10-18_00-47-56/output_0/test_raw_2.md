To create a standalone `reproducer.py` Python file that reproduces the identified issue with Django's `order_by('?')` unexpectedly breaking queryset aggregation, you can follow this template. Note that this script assumes you have Django installed and properly configured to run standalone scripts.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Configure Django in standalone scripts
settings.configure(
    # Use an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',  # This app is required for defining models in the standalone script.
    ),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define dummy models according to the issue description
class Thing(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class Related(models.Model):
    thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, related_name='related', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

# Create the tables for our models
from django.core.management import call_command
call_command('migrate')

try:
    # Create instances according to the issue description
    t = Thing.objects.create()
    Related.objects.create(thing=t)
    Related.objects.create(thing=t)

    # Exercise the described issue
    correct_aggregation = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
    random_aggregation = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')

    # The issue is present if random_aggregation produces the same result as correct_aggregation
    # Since it is expected that `order_by('?')` should not alter the aggregated results in this manner
    if list(correct_aggregation) == list(random_aggregation):
        raise AssertionError("The random order_by('?') unexpectedly altered the aggregation results.")

    print("Test passed: order_by('?') did not alter the aggregation results unexpectedly.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    os._exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    os._exit(1)

os._exit(0)
```

This script performs the following:
- Configures Django to run as a standalone script with an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity.
- Defines two models, `Thing` and `Related`, with a foreign key relationship, mirroring the structure described in the issue.
- Inserts data to replicate the scenario and performs queries that should and should not aggregate data correctly as per the issue description.
- Checks if `order_by('?')` alters the results of an aggregation in a way that's inconsistent with the expectation set in the issue description.

Remember to have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`) before running this script with `python3 reproducerer.py`. 

If this script results in an `AssertionError` with the specific issue regarding `order_by('?')` and queryset aggregation, it means the issue has been successfully reproduced. If it exits with code 0 and no error message, then the issue does not occur, or the conditions for its occurrence have not been replicated accurately in this setup.
