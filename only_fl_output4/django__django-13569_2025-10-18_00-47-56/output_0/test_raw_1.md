To address the reported issue with a standalone Python file that reproduces the scenario and properly handles errors, we'll write a corrected version of the script. This version will include the necessary Django setup within a single file, define the models, execute the queries, and attempt to catch and output the problem as described. You will be required to have Django installed in your environment. 

Please note that the error in the previous attempt was due to the script not properly creating or recognizing the database tables, likely due to Django's model app labeling mechanism. The solution requires specifying an `app_label` for each model and ensuring the Django setup includes an `INSTALLED_APPS` configuration that Django recognizes.

Here is the revised `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count

# Define the Django settings (minimal configuration)
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase.db',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'tests',  # This app label is for our Thing and Related models.
    ],
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Model definitions
class Thing(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'tests'  # Provides an app label for model recognition within Django.

class Related(models.Model):
    thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='related')
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'tests'

# Let's ensure our database schema is up to date
from django.core.management import call_command
call_command('migrate', '--run-syncdb')

def test_order_by_random_breaks_aggregation():
    # Testing setup: create a Thing and related objects.
    t = Thing.objects.create()
    Related.objects.create(thing=t)
    Related.objects.create(thing=t)

    # Perform the queries as per the issue description
    correct_aggregation = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
    random_aggregation = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')

    assert list(correct_aggregation) != list(random_aggregation), "The random order_by('?') should not produce the same aggregation result as the ordered one."

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_order_by_random_breaks_aggregation()
        print("Test passed: Issue is fixed or not present.")
        os._exit(0)  # Use os._exit(0) to exit gracefully
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)
```

This script attempts to ensure proper database setup and migration, defining a minimal Django `settings` configuration to run the script. Ensure you have Django installed (`pip install django`) and run this with `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal.

This updated version addresses the previous issue by providing an explicit `app_label` for model recognition and ensuring the database tables are created before running the tests. Additionally, it exits with code 0 if there's no issue detected (assertion passes), or prints a stack trace and exits with code 1 if an error (including `AssertionError`) occurs.
