Please ensure you have the necessary modules (numpy, matplotlib) installed in your Python environment before running `reproducer.py`. The script attempts to reproduce the issue by comparing the lengths of line segments before and after they are reset, as described. It raises an `AssertionError` if the condition fails, indicating the presence of the issue.
