        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `_print_Derivative` method within the `MCodePrinter` class. This method is intended to accurately convert SymPy derivative expressions into their Mathematica equivalents. It should take a derivative expression as input, decompose it, and reconstruct it in the form `D[<function>, <variable>]` for Mathematica. This process involves identifying the function being derived, the variable with respect to which the derivation occurs, and formatting them appropriately. The implementation ensures that derivatives in SymPy expressions are recognized and outputted correctly when printing to Mathematica code, thereby extending the functionality of `MCodePrinter` to handle a wider array of SymPy expressions."

        "method": "_print_Float",
        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `_print_Float` method within the `MCodePrinter` class. The method is responsible for handling floating-point numbers, specifically those expressed using exponent notation (e.g., `1.0e-4`). In converting these to Mathematica's notation, the method replaces the `e` in the exponent notation with `*^`, transitioning from the Pythonic/standard representation of floats to one recognized by Mathematica (`1.0*^-4`). This adjustment allows for precise representation of floats within the exported Mathematica code, ensuring numerical values are accurately maintained when SymPy expressions are translated by the `MCodePrinter`."
