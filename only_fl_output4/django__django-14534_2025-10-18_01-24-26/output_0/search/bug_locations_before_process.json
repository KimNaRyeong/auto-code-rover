        "intended_behavior": "The `id_for_label` method in the `BoundWidget` class should first check if there's an `id` attribute present in `self.data['attrs']`. If an `id` is present, this method should return it as the ID for the label, instead of generating a new ID based on the widget's name and index. This change would ensure that when an ID is explicitly specified in the widget's attributes, it is used by `BoundWidget.id_for_label`, allowing custom IDs set in `ChoiceWidget.options` or elsewhere to be respected and used correctly. This behavior would preserve the existing functionality of auto-generating IDs when no explicit ID is provided, maintaining backward compatibility."
