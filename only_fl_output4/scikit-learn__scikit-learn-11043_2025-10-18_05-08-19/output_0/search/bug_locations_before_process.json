        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the default value of the 'validate' parameter in the '__init__' method should be modified or extended to incorporate a new option, such as 'array-or-frame'. This new default would intelligently allow DataFrames to pass through without conversion to a NumPy array while still performing validation checks or conversions for other input types as necessary. This behavior should be implemented in such a way that it does not disrupt existing functionality for users who rely on the current default (i.e., strict backward compatibility), possibly through a deprecation cycle warning about the impending change in default behavior."

        "method": "transform",
        "intended_behavior": "The 'transform' method may need adjustments to support the new 'array-or-frame' validation logic. Specifically, it should ensure that when 'validate='array-or-frame'', DataFrames are allowed to pass through the transform process unaltered unless specific conditions dictate otherwise (e.g., if the function applied requires a NumPy array). This involves ensuring that the method does not automatically convert DataFrame inputs into NumPy arrays based on the legacy behavior of 'validate=True'. This change should be compatible with the existing API to maintain backward compatibility, only altering the treatment of DataFrame inputs under the new default validation setting."
