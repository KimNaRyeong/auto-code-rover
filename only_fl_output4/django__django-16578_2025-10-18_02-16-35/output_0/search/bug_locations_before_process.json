        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the constructor for `BaseConstraint` should be modified so that it only accepts keyword arguments for `name` and `violation_error_message`. This change ensures that whenever a `BaseConstraint` or its subclasses are instantiated, the arguments are clearly labeled by their names. This modification preserves the existing functionality where the `name` is a required configuration for the constraint and `violation_error_message` is optional but allows for a customized error message. The modification would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, *, name, violation_error_message=None):\n    self.name = name\n    if violation_error_message is not None:\n        self.violation_error_message = violation_error_message\n    else:\n        self.violation_error_message = self.default_violation_error_message\n```\n\nWith this change, calls to the `BaseConstraint` constructor within Django's codebase (including subclasses that might use `super()`) must be updated to use named arguments, thereby improving code readability and maintainability."
