        "content": "To address the issue, we need to understand the current implementation of `BaseConstraint` and its subclasses, particularly focusing on how their constructors are defined and used. Since the request specifies changing the signature to use keyword-only arguments, identifying the current parameters and any subclass implementations that override these parameters is crucial. Let's start by looking for the `BaseConstraint` class and any direct usage of its constructor, as these will give us the necessary context to plan the change.\n\nHere are the specific API calls that would be helpful for gathering the required information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseConstraint\")`: This will help us locate the file and the class definition of `BaseConstraint` to understand its current constructor signature.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseConstraint\")`: To directly fetch the constructor details of the `BaseConstraint` class, allowing us to see what parameters it currently accepts and how they're structured.\n3. `search_code(\"super().__init__\")`: Since the subclasses could be directly calling the superclass constructor using `super()`, this search will help identify all such calls. This is important for ensuring keyword-only arguments are correctly implemented across all subclasses.\n\nThese calls will provide a comprehensive overview of the `BaseConstraint` constructor's current state and usage, which is critical for planning the modification to keyword-only arguments."
