This likely involves adjusting the alignment properties specifically when detecting a mathtext marker to match the expected alignment of standard markers. This adjustment should be uniform across different marker sizes and positions on the plot to ensure a consistent visual appearance.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: `lib/matplotlib/text.py`, Classes/Methods: not specifically identified due to insufficient context, but related to how text alignment (especially for mathtext) is handled globally across different plot types.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that the global text alignment settings or methods that apply to mathtext respect the same alignment properties as regular text. This might involve a review or update of how the baseline alignment or centering is calculated for text rendered via mathtext to prevent any discrepancies in alignment when compared to other text or markers.\n\nGiven the issue reported, these locations seem the most relevant for addressing the issue of mathtext markers not being center-aligned correctly. The intended behavior in both locations emphasizes the need for consistent alignment handling that doesn't differentiate incorrectly between text types."
