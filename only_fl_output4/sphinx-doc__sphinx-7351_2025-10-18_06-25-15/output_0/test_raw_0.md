Creating a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` to automatically trigger and evaluate the Sphinx issue described requires a set-up where the Sphinx project context is simulated. This implies creating necessary files on-the-fly, running Sphinx, and checking the output to identify the presence of the issue. Notably, the script would need to:

1. Create a temporary Sphinx project with the required files (`index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst`).
2. Run a Sphinx build process on this temporary project.
3. Inspect the generated documentation to determine whether `a.md` or `a.rst` was included, contrary to the expectations set in `index.rst`.

Here's an attempt to craft such a script. Note, however, that Python's built-in capabilities might be insufficient for some Sphinx internal operations, such as evaluating the build's output content directly. This script therefore focuses on preparing the environment, invoking the Sphinx build, and providing guidelines for manually checking the inconsistency, alongside a template for automated checks where feasible.

    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script is theoretical and serves as a framework. Specific adaptation may be necessary, particularly for handling Sphinx build details and accurately inspecting the build output.
