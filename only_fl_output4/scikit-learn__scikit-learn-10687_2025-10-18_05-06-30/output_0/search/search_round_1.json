Search for the `Lasso` class definition to understand its structure and to find any relevant methods that might deal with fitting the model and setting the `coef_` attribute.\n2. Search for the `fit` method within the `Lasso` class, as that is where the logic for fitting the model to the data occurs, and likely where the shape of `coef_` is determined based on `fit_intercept`.\n3.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Lasso Class Definition**:\n   - The `Lasso` class is a subclass of `ElasticNet`. This means that the behavior for fitting the model and setting `coef_` likely inherits or closely follows that of its superclass, `ElasticNet`. Given this, understanding how `ElasticNet` handles the `fit` method and subsequently the `fit_intercept` parameter will be crucial.\n   - The `Lasso` constructor (`__init__`) includes `fit_intercept` as a parameter, which is crucial for the reported issue. The default value is `True`, but in the reported bug, setting it to `False` leads to unexpected behavior regarding the shape of `coef_`.\n\n2. **Relationship With the Bug**:\n   - Since the `fit` method wasn't found in the `Lasso` class, it hints that the actual fitting logic (including how `coef_` is determined) is either inherited from `ElasticNet` without modifications or implemented in a utility function/method that both `ElasticNet` and `Lasso` call.\n   - The issue describes a problem with the `coef_` shape when `fit_intercept=False`. This suggests that whatever logic is responsible for determining the shape of `coef_` might not be correctly accounting for the absence of an intercept term when `fit_intercept` is set to `False`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior of the `fit` method, within the context of handling the `fit_intercept` parameter, is to adjust the shape of `coef_` appropriately based on whether an intercept term is being fit. The expected outcome is that the shape of `coef_` remains consistent (i.e., `(1,)` in the provided example) regardless of the `fit_intercept` setting.\n\nGiven this context and analysis, the next step is to look deeper into the `ElasticNet` class or any utility function that might be shared between `ElasticNet` and `Lasso` for fitting the model. This exploration can aim to discover how `fit_intercept` influences the shape of `coef_`:\n\n- `search_class(\"ElasticNet\")`: To find the implementation details of `ElasticNet`, which might contain or inherit a `fit` method relevant to the issue.\n- `search_method(\"enet_path\")`: Given that `path = staticmethod(enet_path)` is specified within the `Lasso` class code snippet, it's reasonable to investigate the `enet_path` method. This method might be where `coef_` is computed or shaped, possibly handling `fit_intercept`.\n\nThese steps are aimed at collecting more insight into how the shape of `coef_` is determined and how the `fit_intercept` parameter impacts it throughout the fitting process."
