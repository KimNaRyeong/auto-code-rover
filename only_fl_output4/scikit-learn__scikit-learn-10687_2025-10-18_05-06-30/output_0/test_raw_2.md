Based on the requirement and the function provided to print stack trace clearly, below is the standalone Python script `reproducer.py`. When run, this script attempts to reproduce the issue described with `linear_model.Lasso` of `scikit-learn` regarding the assertion error due to unexpected `coef_` shape when `fit_intercept=False`. It will print a detailed stack trace if the issue is encountered, and exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved or is not present.

```python
# Filename: reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn import linear_model

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # With intercept -- reference case
    est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
    est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Unexpected coef_ shape with intercept"
    
    # Without intercept -- case under test
    est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
    est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Shape of `coef_` is wrong when fit_intercept=False"
    
    # If we reach here, then the issue is not present or resolved
    print("Test passed: Shape of `coef_` is as expected.")
    exit(0)  # Exits with 0, indicating success

except AssertionError as e:
    print("AssertionError encountered. The test case failed to pass.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exits with 1, indicating failure

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(-1)  # Exits with -1, indicating an unexpected error
```

Save this script in the root directory of the project and execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py`. The behavior of the script:

- It first runs a reference assertion check with `fit_intercept=True` to confirm the expected behavior.
- Then, it tests the scenario with `fit_intercept=False`, where the issue is expected to manifest.
- If the `AssertionError` occurs due to the shape of `coef_` not being `(1,)` when `fit_intercept=False`, it prints a detailed stack trace for further investigation.
- The script exits with code 0 if the conditions are met without raising the assertion error, indicating the issue is fixed or not present.
