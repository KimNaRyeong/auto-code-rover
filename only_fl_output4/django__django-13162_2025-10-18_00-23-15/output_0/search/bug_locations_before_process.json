        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the logic within this file to generate merge migration filenames based on the names of the migrations being merged, rather than simply using a timestamp. This involves constructing a filename that reflects the content of the merge (i.e., the specific migrations that are being combined). For instance, when merging migrations 0002_conflicting_second and 0002_second, the merge migration's filename should look something like 0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py. This behavior preserves the existing functionality by still uniquely identifying migration files with sequential prefixes (e.g., 0003_), while enhancing clarity by specifying the source migrations involved in the merge in the filename itself. This approach improves the understandability of migration files, particularly in larger projects where tracking the purpose and content of migrations through filenames can significantly streamline development and debugging processes."
