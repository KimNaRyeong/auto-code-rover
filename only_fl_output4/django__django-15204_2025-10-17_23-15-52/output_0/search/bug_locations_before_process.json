        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_duration` method should robustly handle malformed input strings that manage to get past the initial regular expression checks. When converting extracted values to floats (as done in the dictionary comprehension at line 154), this process should be wrapped in a try-except block to gracefully handle `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the string cannot be converted. If an exception is caught, the method should immediately return `None` or possibly raise a more descriptive error, such as `ValidationError`, with a clear message indicating the input string's format is invalid. This change ensures that the application does not crash due to unexpected input and maintains user-friendly behavior by providing clear feedback on the nature of the input error. This keeps the existing functionality for valid inputs while enhancing the error handling for invalid entries."
