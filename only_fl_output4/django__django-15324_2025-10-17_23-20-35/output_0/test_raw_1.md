Based on the specific requirements for clarity and the stack trace, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` file that aims to explicitly address the production of an AssertionError when the issue is present, and ensures a clear exit code conveyance upon the issue being fixed. 

This corrected version also fixes the methodology for injecting a null byte into the extension of the file being uploaded, to better match the described failure scenario:

```python
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_request():
    # File contents are irrelevant for the purpose of reproducing the issue, but size matters
    file_content = (b"." * (1024 * 1024 * 2.5))  # Ensuring the file is >2.5M in size
    files = {"docfile": ("bogus.\x00txt", file_content, "text/plain")}  # Injecting null byte

    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # If the server returns a 500 error, the issue is present.
        if response.status_code == 500:
            raise AssertionError("File upload failed, server returned 500 Internal Server Error")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for assertion failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for general errors

    # If the code execution reaches this point, assume the issue is fixed.
    print("Issue appears to be resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_malformed_request()
```

**Please Note:**
- Before executing this script, ensure the target Django application is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.
- The Django application should be prepared to handle POST requests to its root (`/`) URL or to the specific endpoint expected by this script, and capable of handling file uploads through a form submission.
- This script anticipates catching an `AssertionError` specifically when the known issue is present. If the issue is fixed, thereby preventing the server from returning a 500 error, the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.
