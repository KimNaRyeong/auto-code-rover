Below is a `reproducer.py` script that checks for the existence of the issue as described. It leverages Python's introspection capabilities to verify if the `Child.method` classmethod inherited its documentation from the `Parent.method`. If the documentation is not inherited, indicating the presence of the reported issue, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. Conversely, if the documentation is properly inherited, the script will complete successfully with an exit code of 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Parent:
    @classmethod
    def method(cls) -> int:
        """Return an integer."""
        return 17

class Child(Parent):
    @classmethod
    def method(cls):
        return 42

try:
    parent_doc = Parent.method.__doc__
    child_doc = Child.method.__doc__
    # Verify inheritance of documentation
    assert child_doc == parent_doc, "Child method did not inherit parent documentation."
    print("Success: Documentation was inherited correctly.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate issue presence
```

This script directly tackles the issue by comparing the documentation strings of the `Parent.method` and `Child.method`. If these strings are not equal, it implies that the documentation was not inherited as expected. The stack trace provides useful insights into where the assertion failed, offering clues for further investigation or debugging.
