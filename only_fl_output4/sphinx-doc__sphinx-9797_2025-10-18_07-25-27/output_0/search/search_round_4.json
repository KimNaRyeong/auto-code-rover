This should be handled automatically by the documentation generation tool (Sphinx with `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension), but since it\u2019s not working as expected, a potential solution might involve ensuring the Sphinx configuration or employing a Sphinx extension that explicitly supports this feature or implements a workaround.\n\n- If the behavior is not currently supported by Sphinx `autodoc`, one could potentially explore or develop a custom Sphinx extension that hooks into the autodoc process to check for undocumented methods in derived classes and automatically copy the documentation from the base class method if available.\n   \nThis approach would require updating or augmenting the project\u2019s Sphinx configuration to use the modified or new extension that supports this behavior.

These files are part of Sphinx's internal mechanism for handling extensions, including `autodoc`, which is essential for automatically documenting Python codebases.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug:** The bug is directly related to the functionality provided by `sphinx.ext.autodoc`, specifically how it handles (or fails to handle) the inheritance of docstrings for class methods in subclasses. The presence of `autodoc` related code in so many parts of the `sphinx` directory suggests that there might be hooks or mechanisms that could potentially be extended or adjusted to address the issue.\n   - **Intended Behavior in Context of the Issue:** Ideally, the code responsible for processing docstrings within `sphinx.ext.autodoc` should be able to recognize when a method in a subclass overrides a method in the parent class without providing its own docstring and, accordingly, inherit the parent class's method docstring. Enhancements or adjustments could potentially be made in files like `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` or other related modules to ensure this behavior.\n\n2. **Search Code (\"Return an integer.\") and Search Method (\"method\"):**\n   - These searches did not yield results, which limits the direct context we can get about how and where the specific method and its documentation are used across the project.

This could involve:\n\n- Reviewing the implementation details within these files for potential areas where the default behavior could be adjusted to better handle docstring inheritance.\n- Identifying any extension points or hooks within the `autodoc` extension that allow for custom processing of docstrings and determining if those could be utilized or extended to achieve the desired documentation inheritance.\n- Considering configuration options within `doc/conf.py` that might influence how `autodoc` processes and includes documentation for members, specifically looking for flags or settings that relate to inherited members or docstrings.\n\nIn summary, although the direct code snippets and method were not found, the significant references to `autodoc` within the Sphinx internals suggest avenues for exploring modifications or enhancements to address the reported issue."
