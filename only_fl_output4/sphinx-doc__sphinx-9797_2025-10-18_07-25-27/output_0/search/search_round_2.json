However, based on the description of the issue, we can infer the general location and nature of the bug and what the intended behavior should be.\n\n### General Bug Location and Intended Behavior:\n\n- **File:** `src/spam.py`\n- **Classes:** `Parent`, `Child`\n- **Method:** `method` in both `Parent` and `Child` classes.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\nThe intended behavior in this case is for the `Child` class's `method` to inherit the documentation from the `Parent` class's `method` when no explicit documentation string is provided in the `Child` class's method. This should be handled automatically by the documentation generation tool (Sphinx with `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension), but since it\u2019s not working as expected, a potential solution might involve ensuring the Sphinx configuration or employing a Sphinx extension that explicitly supports this feature or implements a workaround.\n\n- If the behavior is not currently supported by Sphinx `autodoc`, one could potentially explore or develop a custom Sphinx extension that hooks into the autodoc process to check for undocumented methods in derived classes and automatically copy the documentation from the base class method if available.\n   \nThis approach would require updating or augmenting the project\u2019s Sphinx configuration to use the modified or new extension that supports this behavior. This solution aims to preserve the existing functionality of the project while resolving the issue of inherited documentation not being displayed for overridden class methods."

This extension would need to:\n   \n   - Inspect classes for methods that are overridden and lack documentation.\n   - Automatically retrieve and apply the documentation from the parent class method if it exists.\n\n3. **Contribute to Sphinx (if applicable)**: If a generic solution is developed that could benefit others, consider contributing this back to the Sphinx project or sharing it within the community.\n\n4. **Documentation Update**: Meanwhile, a workaround could be to manually ensure that documentation exists for methods in subclasses or to reference the parent class's documentation in the subclass method documentation as a temporary measure.\n\nDue to the limitations in directly querying the project's code structure and contents with the search APIs, this approach emphasizes adjustments and enhancements to Sphinx processing as opposed to specific code modifications within the project itself."
