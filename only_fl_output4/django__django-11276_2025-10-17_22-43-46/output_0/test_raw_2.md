To address this request explicitly, the reproduced scenario will be designed to assess two primary concerns derived from the issue description:

1. Performance advantage of `html.escape()` over `django.utils.html.escape()`.
2. The backward compatibility concern due to the transformation of `'` into different HTML entities (`&#39;` vs. `&#x27;`).

The `reproducer.py` script is outlined below to conduct these evaluations and produce the desired outcomes based on the described conditions.

```python
import timeit
import html

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # We attempt to use django.utils.html.escape but fall back to directly comparing with html.escape if Django isn't installed
    try:
        from django.utils.html import escape as django_escape
    except ImportError:
        print("Django is not installed. Please install Django to run this reproduction script.")
        exit(1)

    sample_text = "O'Reilly & Associates"

    # Measuring performance
    django_time = timeit.timeit('django_escape(sample_text)', globals=globals(), number=10000)
    stdlib_time = timeit.timeit('html.escape(sample_text)', globals=globals(), number=10000)

    # Comparing output, specifically the treatment of apostrophes
    django_output = django_escape(sample_text)
    stdlib_output = html.escape(sample_text)

    try:
        assert stdlib_time < django_time, "Performance improvement not observed with html.escape."
        assert django_output.replace("&#39;", "&#x27;") == stdlib_output, "Output difference regarding apostrophe encoding."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 indicating the issue is present

    print("No issues detected. html.escape() is faster and compatible with minor adjustments for apostrophe treatment.")
    exit(0)  # Exits with code 0 indicating the issue has been addressed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please keep in mind the following considerations for this script:

- The script assumes Django is installed in the project environment since it directly imports and attempts to use `django.utils.html.escape`. If Django isn't installed, it prompts the user to install Django and exits with an error code.
- Performance testing (`timeit`) and output comparison are straightforward approaches to validate the reported issue's claims.
- The `AssertionError` is specifically raised to highlight discrepancies either in expected performance improvements or in output compatibility concerning the treatment of apostrophes. Conversely, a message indicating no issues detected signifies that under the script's execution conditions, `html.escape()` is faster while still providing functionally equivalent output once apostrophes have been normalized.

**Note:** The actual performance improvement and compatibility might vary depending on factors like Python and Django versions, so this script primarily serves as a baseline for comparison under controlled conditions.
