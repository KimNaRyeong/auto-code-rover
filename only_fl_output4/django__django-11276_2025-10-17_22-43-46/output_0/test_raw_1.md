Based on the requirements and the prior code snippet, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding regarding the issue that needs to be reproduced. If the prior implementation did not expose the issue due to either an environmental setup or incorrect assumptions, let's adjust the scope based on your instructions.

Given your goal is to test the performance and output discrepancy between Django's `escape` function and Python's standard library `html.escape` function, and that the previous implementation exited with code `0` without raising an `AssertionError`, it implies that adjustments are needed. 

This revised `reproducer.py` script specifically targets the reproduction of the alleged issue, taking into consideration:

1. Strictly testing for performance improvement claims.
2. Explicitly checking for the stated minor output discrepancy (`&#39;` vs. `&#x27;`).

Please note, for this script to run, you need a Django environment setup due to the dependency on `from django.utils.html import escape`.

```python
import timeit
import html

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from django.utils.html import escape as django_escape

        test_string = "copyright <&> 'quotes'"

        django_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: django_escape(test_string), number=100000)
        html_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: html.escape(test_string), number=100000)

        if html_time >= django_time:
            raise AssertionError("html.escape() performance is not better than Django's escape().")

        django_output = django_escape(test_string)
        html_output = html.escape(test_string)

        if django_output.replace("&#39;", "&#x27;") != html_output:
            raise AssertionError("html.escape() output does not match Django's escape() after normalization.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with error code 1 if issue is present

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print("No issues detected.", exit(0))
```

This script attempts to more closely validate the issue at hand: checking for performance discrepancies and output differences between Django's and the standard library's `escape()` functions. If the issue is present (i.e., `html.escape()` is not faster than `django.escape()` after correction or the output normalization does not hold), the script should now properly raise an `AssertionError` and exit with code `1`. Conversely, if no problems are found (indicating the issue is effectively resolved or non-existent under the test conditions), it will print "No issues detected." and exit with code `0`.
