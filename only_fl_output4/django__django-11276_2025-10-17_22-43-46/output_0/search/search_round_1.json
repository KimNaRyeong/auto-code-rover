We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the context gathered through the API calls:\n\n1. **Result from `search_method_in_file(\"escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")`:**\n\n   The `escape` function as defined in `django/utils/html.py` is clearly outlined for the purposes of encoding ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe use in HTML. This method applies a transformation using the `_html_escapes` mapping, which is likely a predefined dictionary mapping specific characters to their HTML escape codes. The use of `mark_safe` indicates that the returned string is marked as safe for use in HTML, preventing Django from escaping it again when outputting to a template.\n\n   **Relationship to the Bug:**\n\n   The description of the GitHub issue suggests that this method duplicates functionality available in the Python standard library since version 3.2, specifically `html.escape()`. The issue also mentions that using the stdlib's `html.escape()` could lead to performance improvements. Upon examination, the custom implementation in Django uses `.translate()`, which is already identified in the issue description as a potentially less efficient approach compared to the replacement mechanism used in `html.escape()`.\n\n   **Intended Behavior:**\n\n   Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be to efficiently escape ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for HTML usage. Replacing the current Django implementation with a direct call to `html.escape()` from the Python standard library would align with the goals of reducing code duplication, leveraging community-maintained code, and possibly improving performance.\n\n2. **Result of `search_code(\"html.escape\")`:**\n\n   This search did not return any results, indicating that `html.escape()` is not directly used anywhere else in the Django codebase at the moment. This means there's no direct example within Django to reference for how `html.escape()` has been integrated or used in other contexts, which is crucial information because any change would need to ensure compatibility with existing Django utilities and user expectations.\n\n3. **Result of `search_code_in_file(\"from django.utils.html import escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")`:**\n\n   No results were found for self-imports within `django/utils/html.py`, which simply confirms that there is no circular dependency within the same file. This was more about checking the integrity and structure of the module rather than directly addressing the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the collected context and analysis:\n\n- The update should ensure backward compatibility for users who might rely on the exact output of the current `django.utils.html.escape()` function.\n- The reference to Python's bug tracker suggests an underlying emphasis on performance, indicating that any replacement must not only be functionally equivalent but also provide a measurable performance improvement.\n- Attention should be given to any Django-specific customizations or safety considerations in the current implementation, ensuring that replacing it with `html.escape()` does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or regressions in how escaped content is handled within Django templates.\n\nNext steps would likely involve drafting a patch proposal that substitutes `django.utils.html.escape()` with a call to `html.escape()`, while carefully considering the noted potential differences in output (such as the encoding of single quotes) and ensuring that all tests are updated to reflect this change. Since the `html.escape()` replacement concern was mentioned, additional research or API calls may target how Django ensures the safety of escaped strings and whether there are precedents in Django's codebase for handling similar standard library substitutions."
