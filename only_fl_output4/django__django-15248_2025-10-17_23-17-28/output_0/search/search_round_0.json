If it's deleted from a model.delete(), you know which instance initiated the delete and if it's from a queryset.delete() you know which queryset initiated the delete, with the models in that queryset. Using this you know if the instance is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n</issue>"

Search for methods related to the deletion of objects directly through models or via querysets. This can give insight into how deletes are currently handled and where enhancements can be applied.\n   - `search_method(\"delete\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. Since the deletion might also be initiated from a specific model instance, understand how the `delete` method is utilized within models.\n   - `search_class(\"Model\")` \n\nThese calls aim to find the relevant parts of the codebase where modifications are needed to include the origin of the delete in the signals."
