        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `fps` method to ensure that it always returns an instance of `FormalPowerSeries`, even when the input function is a simple polynomial that does not usually require an expansion to be represented as a formal power series. This change will allow users to consistently work with the return value of `fps` as a `FormalPowerSeries` object, using indexing and other operations without encountering type errors."
