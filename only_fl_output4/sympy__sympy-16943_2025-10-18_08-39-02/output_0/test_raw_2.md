Given your requirements, let's craft a `reproducer.py` that specifically aims to reproduce the issue as described, using the provided function for printing stack traces when the issue is detected. This script will assert the type of the result returned by `fps` to ensure it's not a formal power series when it is expected to work otherwise, contrary to the user's expectation based on the given issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, fps
    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        p = fps(x ** 2)
        # Checking whether `p` is not an instance of a formal power series.
        # This is the core of the issue as described.
        if not p.is_Pow:
            raise AssertionError("fps did not return x**2 as a Pow object.")
        # Attempt to index into the result to see if it fails as described.
        try:
            _ = p[0]  # This should fail if `p` is not the correct formal power series type.
            raise AssertionError("Indexing into the result did not raise the expected TypeError.")
        except TypeError:
            print("The reproduced issue is consistent with the TypeError expectation.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensures that any unexpected error also results in an exit with an error code.

    # If the script reaches this point without exiting, assume the original issue could not be reproduced.
    print("The issue could not be reproduced under this test environment.")
    exit(0)
```

This script attempts to validate the behavior as described in the issue: it expects `fps` not to return a formal power series object for `x ** 2`, where such an outcome would contradict the expected behavior. It then tries to index into the result to mimic the action that leads to the `TypeError` in the issue description.

It exits with code `0` if these specific conditions aren't met (implying the issue couldn't be reproduced under the test environment) and with code `1` if either an assertion fails or if an unexpected error is encountered, thereby indicating the problem persists or there's a flaw in the test setup.
