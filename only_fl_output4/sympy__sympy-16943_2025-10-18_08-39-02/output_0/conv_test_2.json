However, the script is designed to raise an exception only if `fps` returns a simple type like `str` or `int` when it shouldn't, which could indeed fail to catch the exact nature of the initial issue.\n\nFor a script that strictly follows the initial issue's description (expecting a `FormalPowerSeries` object or handling types correctly), the initial response attempted to match that yet may have misunderstood the environment in which the issue can't be reproduced due to the test passing where the failure was expected. This response aims to correct that oversight by not directly asserting the type to a `FormalPowerSeries` since the problem described involved an unexpected type (`Pow`) and operation support (indexing), which may require a more nuanced handling approach in a real debugging scenario."
