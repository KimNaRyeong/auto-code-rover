        "content": "To address the issue described, which is about \"Unnecessary joins in admin changelist query\" related to Django models and admin search_fields functionality, the following API calls would be essential to gather sufficient context:\n\n1. To understand how the models `Client` and `ClientOffice` are defined and potentially used within the Django application, it's important to search for their class definitions:\n   - `search_class(\"Client\")`\n   - `search_class(\"ClientOffice\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions admin options and specifically the `search_fields` of `ClientAdmin`, it's crucial to find the `ClientAdmin` class to understand how it's configured and how it might be contributing to the problem:\n   - `search_class(\"ClientAdmin\")`\n\n3. The issue description hints at a pattern `qs = qs.filter(...)` leading to an increasing number of joins because each word in the search query adds another. This pattern is likely used in the method that processes the search query within the admin options. So, we should look for methods in `ClientAdmin` that might be responsible for handling search queries. Given that `get_search_results` is a common method used for this purpose in Django admin, let's search for it in the `ClientAdmin` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_search_results\", \"ClientAdmin\")`\n\n4. Lastly, since the issue highlights a performance degradation that stems from handling search queries with several words, we should also look for any custom methods or overridden methods in both the `Client` and `ClientOffice` models that might relate to search operations or query optimizations:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"search\", \"Client\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"search\", \"ClientOffice\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context around how models and the admin class are structured and interact, especially in relation to handling search operations that could be causing the performance issues described."
