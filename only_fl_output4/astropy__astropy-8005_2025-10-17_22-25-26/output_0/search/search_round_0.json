This seems inconsistent, so can we try and make things more consistent for the 3.1 release? (I see this as bug-like, so I think it can be addressed after feature freeze).\nNote that this is related to https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8003 - if we change the default cosmology to Planck 2015, then we can change the ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to use the default cosmology without changing results (for now).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To collect sufficient context for resolving the described issue, we will need to understand where and how both the `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency and the `with_H0` equivalency are implemented in the codebase. Since the issue mentions they are using different default cosmologies (Planck 2015 and WMAP9 respectively), fetching the source code and implementation details of these equivalencies, as well as how the default cosmology is set and utilized in the project, becomes crucial.\n\nBased on the given description, the following API calls would provide valuable context:\n\n1. Search for the method implementation or reference to `thermodynamic_temperature` to understand how it's currently utilizing the Planck 2015 cosmology as a default value.\n\n2. Search for the method or implementation details of `with_H0` to comprehend how it is using the default cosmology.\n\n3. Search for how `default_cosmology.get()` is defined and used within the codebase to see how default cosmologies like WMAP9 are set and retrieved.\n\n4. Given that the issue involves the use of constants and settings from the `cosmology` module, gathering some context on how cosmology configurations are generally handled might be useful. Specifically, examining the Planck15 and default_cosmology configurations within their definitions could provide insights into a potential solution.\n\nSo, the specific API calls I would make are:\n\n- `search_method(\"thermodynamic_temperature\")`\n- `search_method(\"with_H0\")`\n- `search_code(\"default_cosmology.get()\")`\n- `search_code(\"Planck15.Tcmb0\")`\n- `search_class(\"Planck15\")`"
