Given the context of your request and understanding the previous script's failure due to a regex error, I will provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that avoids the regex mistake and should properly execute to detect the issue regarding '.[' being replaced with '[' in the pytest report headline.

This script will follow the same approach but with a corrected pattern check:

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else ""
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    test_content = """import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""

    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w', delete=False, suffix=".py") as tmpfile:
        tmpfile_path = tmpfile.name
        tmpfile.write(test_content)

    try:
        cmd = ["pytest", tmpfile_path, "--tb=long"]
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        reported_name = f'test_boo[.[]'
        if reported_name in result.stdout:
            print("Issue reproduced successfully. '.[' was not replaced.")
        else:
            assert reported_name in result.stdout, "Expected replacement issue not found in pytest output."
        # Ensure to delete temporary file
        subprocess.run(["rm", tmpfile_path])
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code for unhandled issue presence
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected or the issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

- This script avoids using regex to check for the presence of the issue in the pytest output due to the complexity and potential for mistakes in pattern escaping. Instead, it directly checks for the string.
- The `test_content` string defines a pytest test simulating the issue context.
- Subprocess runs pytest with the generated temporary test file, expecting the issue to manifest in the output as described ('test_boo[.[]').
- On match, it confirms the reproduction of the issue; otherwise, it raises an `AssertionError`.
- Note: The solution assumes you have `pytest` installed in your environment.

Run this with `python3 reproducer.py` at the root directory of the project. Make sure to adjust the execution environment as needed to match your setup.
