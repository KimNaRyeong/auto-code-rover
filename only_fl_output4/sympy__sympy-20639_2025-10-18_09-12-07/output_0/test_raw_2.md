To accurately represent the issue encountered with the incorrect rendering of `pi**(1/E)` and address your request for a script that specifically checks for this rendering error, the focus needs to be on the `pretty` output. Since the previous script did not reproduce the issue, let's write a `reproducer.py` file that directly tests the pretty-print rendering of the expression.

The script will use SymPy's pretty printing to compare the output against what is expected. If the output matches the incorrect rendering, it will throw an AssertionError. If the output is correct, it will exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import pi, E, pretty

    # The expression that is reportedly rendered inaccurately
    expression = pi**(1/E)
    
    # Getting the pretty print output
    pretty_output = pretty(expression)

    incorrect_pretty_output = "-1___\n╲╱ π"

    try:
        # Check if the pretty print output matches the incorrect output reported
        assert pretty_output != incorrect_pretty_output, "Incorrect pretty rendering detected."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("The issue is present:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the issue is present

    # If no issue, print a success message and exit with code 0
    print("No issue detected with pretty printing of pi**(1/E).")
    import sys
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This standalone Python script directly checks the pretty-print output of the expression `pi**(1/E)` against the erroneously rendered output provided in the initial issue description. The script satisfies your requirement of raising an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace if it detects the erroneous rendering, thereby demonstrating whether the described issue is present or not.
