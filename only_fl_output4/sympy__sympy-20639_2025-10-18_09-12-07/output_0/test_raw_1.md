This script fixes the previous oversight by correctly checking against the expressed issue of inaccurate rendering, specifically in pretty print mode, compared to the correct LaTeX and string representations. However, it primarily addresses the reported inconsistency through string comparison, implicitly assuming the rendering issue would manifest there as well, which might not directly capture the issue's nature if it specifically pertains to how the `pretty` function renders output independently of its string representation. Adjustments might be needed to focus on the actual rendering output for an accurate reproduction of the issue.
