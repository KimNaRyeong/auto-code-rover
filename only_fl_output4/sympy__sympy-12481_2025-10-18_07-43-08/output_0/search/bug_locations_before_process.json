        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should be modified to support non-disjoint cycles by applying these cycles in a left-to-right order to compute the resultant permutation, instead of raising a `ValueError`. This involves adjusting the input validation logic within the method or within any helper method it calls for processing the cycles. The constructor should retain its ability to handle disjoint cycles and other input forms (if any) as is, ensuring that existing functionalities are preserved. When non-disjoint cycles are provided, they should be correctly merged into a single cycle (or multiple disjoint cycles if that's how they resolve) representing the same permutation effect as applying each cycle in sequence. This adjustment will align the method's behavior with the issue's request, allowing more flexible permutations construction while maintaining backward compatibility and the integrity of the class's functionality."
