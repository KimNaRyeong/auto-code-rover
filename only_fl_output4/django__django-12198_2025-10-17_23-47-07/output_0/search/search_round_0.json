        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we will need to gather code context from several key areas outlined in the issue description. The core aspects are the `sensitive_variables` decorator, the `authenticate` method within a custom `AuthenticationBackend`, and how `inspect.getcallargs` interacts with decorated methods. Let's plan the API calls accordingly:\n\n1. **`sensitive_variables` Decorator**: Since this is likely not a method, but rather a function or a specific utility, we should start by searching for any code that mentions `sensitive_variables` directly. This will help us understand how it's implemented or used throughout the codebase. \n\n2. **Custom `AuthenticationBackend` Class**: `authenticate` is a method likely belonging to classes that derive from a base authentication backend. We may not find a direct hit for \"CustomAuthenticationBackend\" as the class name, but searching for `authenticate` within classes that contain `AuthenticationBackend` in their name would be a good start. The original `AuthenticationBackend` class should also be located.\n\n3. **Usage of `inspect.getcallargs`**: Since the issue mentions an interaction with `inspect.getcallargs`, we should look for its usage, especially in conjunction with `authenticate` methods or within the implementation of `sensitive_variables`.\n\nGiven these insights, the API calls to make are:\n\n- `search_code(\"sensitive_variables\")`: To find the implementation or usage of the `sensitive_variables` decorator.\n- `search_class(\"AuthenticationBackend\")`: To find the base class or any derivatives of `AuthenticationBackend`.\n- `search_method(\"authenticate\")`: To find implementations of the `authenticate` method across the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"inspect.getcallargs\")`: To locate where `inspect.getcallargs` is used, potentially in relation to the issue at hand.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context for the issue, allowing for targeted investigation and eventual patch development."
