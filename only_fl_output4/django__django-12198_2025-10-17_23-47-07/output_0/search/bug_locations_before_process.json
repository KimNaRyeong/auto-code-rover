        "intended_behavior": "The `sensitive_variables` decorator should preserve the signature of the function it decorates. This implies that when applied to an `authenticate` method in custom authentication backends, it should not interfere with `inspect.getcallargs` ability to accurately validate function arguments. The decorator should ensure sensitive variables are obscured without altering the callable signature or how the function's arguments are processed. This might require adjusting the implementation of `sensitive_variables` to better handle decorated functions, ensuring compatibility with Python's introspection used by `inspect.getcallargs`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `authenticate` function should handle scenarios where the `authenticate` method of backends is decorated (e.g., with `sensitive_variables`), without leading to unintended `TypeError` exceptions for mismatched arguments. This might involve adjusting how `inspect.getcallargs` is used to validate credentials against backends' `authenticate` methods or implementing additional checks to ensure compatibility with decorated methods. The goal is to allow custom backends that use `sensitive_variables` to work as expected, as they did in version 1.6."
