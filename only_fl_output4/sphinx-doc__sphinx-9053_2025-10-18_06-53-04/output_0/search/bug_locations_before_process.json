Specifically, any new method or class from docutils-0.17b1 that is leveraged by Sphinx should be properly integrated here, ensuring backward compatibility with previous versions if necessary. This might include updating function calls to docutils, handling new node types, or adjusting to changes in the docutils parsing logic. The goal is to preserve existing functionality while embracing the new version's capabilities or changes."
