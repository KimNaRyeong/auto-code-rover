Specifically, the `tex2uni` dictionary within this file should be carefully expanded to map new LaTeX command names to their corresponding Unicode values, as suggested in the issue. The additions should follow the existing format of the dictionary, with each new entry adhering to the structure 'LaTeX command name': Unicode code point. It\u2019s crucial that these new entries are checked for accuracy in terms of both LaTeX symbol names and Unicode points, ensuring they match the symbols intended by those who raised the issue. Also, compatibility with existing entries must be maintained\u2014new additions should not overwrite or conflict with the current mappings. This update will enhance Matplotlib's LaTeX rendering capabilities by including a broader range of mathematical symbols."
