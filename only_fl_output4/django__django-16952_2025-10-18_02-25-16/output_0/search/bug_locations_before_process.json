The fix should ensure that during the saving of parent models, any OneToOneField linking between parent and child models considers the unique nature of these fields, perhaps by adding a check or handling mechanism that ensures `attname` is used properly without leading to an AttributeError. This handling should maintain the existing functionality for models that do not involve complex MTI hierarchies, thereby preserving backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "While the core issue may not lie directly within the `OneToOneField` class definition, it's possible enhancements or adjustments might be necessary here to support the intended behavior in `_save_parents`. If the error is due to a misunderstanding of how an `attname` should be accessed for `OneToOneField` instances, ensuring clear documentation or helper methods within this class could be beneficial. Alternatively, if it's identified that the OneToOneField needs additional handling when saving models in MTI structures, then implementing that logic or making this requirement explicit could resolve the issue. Specifically, modifications should ensure that any operation requiring `attname` on a `OneToOneField` should correctly reference or compute this attribute, supporting the correct saving of models in nested MTI contexts without causing attribute errors."
