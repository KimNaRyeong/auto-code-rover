        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nFigure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example : \r\n```\r\nimport seaborn as sns\r\nimport seaborn.objects as so\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\r\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\r\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\r\np = (\r\n    so.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\r\n    .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\r\n)\r\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\r\n\r\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\r\nax.scatter([1],[1])\r\n\r\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\r\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\r\n\r\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\r\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n"
