Specifically, it should handle frequent and successive changes efficiently, ensuring the development server reloads every time changes are made, without missing updates. This could involve refining the logic that monitors file system events or improving how these events trigger the reload process. Additionally, considering Docker or other container environments in the autoreload logic could ensure consistent behavior across different development setups."

It should verify that all components of the autoreload system are correctly hooked into the development server startup process, ensuring that file change notifications are accurately captured and acted upon. If necessary, adjustments should be made to address potential issues related to running within Docker environments, such as modifying how file system events are interpreted or improving the handling of path mappings."
