        "content": "<issue>Django 2.2 autoreloader is failing intermittently (not using watchman)\nDescription\nSince upgrading to Django 2.2 the autoreloader is working differently and is not always picking up changes to .py files to reload runserver. It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding Django 2.2's autoreloader not consistently picking up changes to `.py` files, we need to understand how Django's autoreloader has been implemented and identify any changes made from Django 2.1.7 to Django 2.2. The issue does not specify exact filenames, classes, or method names. However, it hints at a few key components involved in autoreloading functionality. Therefore, we should start by looking into the autoreloader mechanism within Django's codebase for clues on what might be causing the intermittent failure.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, we suspect changes in the autoreloader's behavior could be tied to specific functions or configuration settings that manage file monitoring and reloading logic. Specifically, we need to know how Django detects file changes and triggers reloading in the absence of watchman. Here are the API calls that can help us gather context from the project:\n\n1. Search for classes and methods related to the autoreloader:\n   - `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n   - `search_method(\"runserver\")`\n   - `search_method(\"autoreload\")`\n\n2. Once we have the filenames where these classes or methods are defined, we can look deeper into specific changes detection mechanisms or configuration, including intervals, ignore patterns, or specific conditions under which autoreload might fail to detect changes:\n   - We can use `search_code(\"inotify\")` as Linux and Docker often use inotify for file system event monitoring, which might be involved in Django's autoreloading logic.\n   - Similarly, `search_code(\"ignore\")` might reveal configurations or logic regarding files or changes that the autoreloader is programmed to ignore, which could have changed with Django 2.2.\n\nThe outcomes of these API calls will provide us with specific files, methods, and configurations involved in the autoreloading mechanism. This information is critical for understanding the potential differences in autoreloading behavior observed after upgrading to Django 2.2 and will guide our next steps towards crafting a patch."
