These calls will aim to find where `index_together` is defined and used, understand how `indexes` and `Index` class are implemented, and potentially identify existing usage patterns that might inform how the deprecation could be handled.\n\n1. To understand how `index_together` is currently used within model definitions, we would want to find its occurrences in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue suggests favoring `Model.Meta.indexes` and the `Index` class, it would be useful to gather examples of how `indexes` are currently being defined within model meta classes, if at all.\n   - `search_code(\"class Meta\")`\n   - `search_code(\"indexes =\")`\n\n3. To get an understanding of the `Index` class itself, assuming it might be defined within the Django model framework or within the project's custom implementations, let's locate its definition.\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n4. Assuming there might be a method or function related to processing or interpreting `index_together` and `indexes` within the model meta class, let's also look for relevant methods in the `Model` class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_indexes\", \"Model\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"add_index\", \"Model\")`\n\nThese API calls are crafted to collect a comprehensive view of how indexing is handled within the project, where `index_together` and `indexes` are currently used, and how the `Index` class is defined and utilized. This information will be crucial in understanding the scope of changes needed and how to implement the deprecation of `index_together` in favor of a more structured approach using `Model.Meta.indexes` and the `Index` class."
