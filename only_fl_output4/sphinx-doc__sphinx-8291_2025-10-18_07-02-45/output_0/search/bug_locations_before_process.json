If an attribute has a type hint, this type should be automatically incorporated into the attribute documentation generated by Sphinx. Ensure that if `:type` is explicitly mentioned in the docstring, it doesn't result in duplication but rather supplements or confirms the type hint. Ideally, introduce a mechanism to merge the documentation and type information, favoring explicit docstring types if they provide more detail than the type hint, to avoid information loss."
