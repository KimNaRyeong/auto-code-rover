        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

Since the issue mentions problems with documentation generation, particularly with the Napoleon extension and `autodoc`, it's essential to look into how classes and their attributes are defined and documented in the mentioned files. The user has provided links to specific configurations and code, which mentions `conf.py` and files under `src/pheres/exceptions.py`. Given this information, the relevant API calls would be:\n\n1. To understand how the documentation configuration might be affecting this, we should first check the Sphinx configuration:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"docs/conf.py\")` - to see how `napoleon` is configured in `conf.py`.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the utilization of `attrs` and potentially data classes, let's inspect the classes within the specified exceptions file to understand how attributes are being declared and documented:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"attr.s(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - This will help us find classes decorated with `attr.s()` to see how attributes are being defined.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"@dataclass\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - Although not directly mentioned if dataclasses are used in this particular file, it's helpful to check considering the issue's discussion about them.\n\n3. The concern about duplicate definitions in the documentation requires checking for instances of attributes being documented in the Google style docstrings and how they are defined in the code:\n- `search_code_in_file(\":type\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - to check if there are type hints within the docstrings in the exceptions file.\n\nThis combination of API calls should provide a thorough understanding of the problem by revealing how `napoleon` is configured, how `attrs` are utilized and documented in the `exceptions.py` file, and whether or not there's an overlap between code annotations and docstring annotations that's leading to the issue described."

However, it's important to note that directly searching the codebase without specific files might lead to a broader and less targeted set of results. Here are alternative approaches and the rationale behind them:\n\n1. **Broaden the search for configuration and class definitions**:\n   Since `docs/conf.py` couldn't be found, there's a possibility it might be located in a different directory, or there could have been a mistake in the mentioned path. Similarly, for the `src/pheres/exceptions.py` file, the paths provided might have been incorrect, or such files might not be committed to the codebase accessible through the API.\n\n2. **Look for usage patterns that could lead to the documentation issue**:\n   Given no specific instances were found, we should look for patterns of `attr.s` usage and `@dataclass` decorators more broadly. It's also worth checking how type hints are being incorporated across multiple files as the issue description hints at a widespread concern rather than isolated cases.\n\n3. **Search for configuration and documentation-related code**:\n   Without direct access to `docs/conf.py`, we can attempt searching for mentions of `napoleon` and Sphinx configuration settings across all conf.py files in the docs directory or the entire project. Similarly, we could search for uses of `attr.s` and `@dataclass` more broadly in the project to understand if the documentation issue might be related to how these are generally used rather than specific instances.\n\nGiven this situation, here are revised API search calls:\n- `search_code(\"napoleon\")` - To look for any Napoleon configuration in the project.\n- `search_code(\"attr.s(\")` - To find usage of `attrs` across the project.\n- `search_code(\"@dataclass\")` - To identify where Python 3.7+ data classes are being used.\n- `search_code(\":type\")` - To see if and how type hints within docstrings are utilized globally in the project.\n\nThese broader calls should give us more insight into whether the problem is a systemic issue with how `napoleon` handles type hints in the presence of `attrs` or data classes, or if it's more related to specific configurations or usage patterns. Analyzing any resulting code snippets will help in connecting the issue description with observed practices in the codebase."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

These configurations dictate how Sphinx processes and renders docstrings into documentation.\n\n   **Intended Behavior**: The intended configuration should allow `napoleon` to automatically extract and utilize type hints from the code (particularly from `attr.s` decorated classes and data classes) without causing duplication in the documentation. This would likely involve setting or adding a Sphinx extension or configuration option that merges attribute descriptions with their type hints in the `Attributes:` section without repeating them.\n\n2. **Bug Location**: In classes that use `attrs` and/or are decorated with `@dataclass` across the project. The documentation strings of these classes might need adjustments or enhancements in combination with changes in Sphinx configuration to correctly render attributes with their types in the documentation.\n\n   **Intended Behavior**: For classes defined with `attrs` or as data classes, ensure that the docstrings are compatible with how `napoleon` processes them. This might involve a specific format or using a particular Sphinx plugin or extension designed to handle Python annotations effectively. The goal would be to ensure that the documentation generated includes both the description and the type hint of each attribute in a single entry under the `Attributes:` section without requiring duplication of information.\n\nWithout being able to execute further context-gathering API calls or having direct access to the project's source code, these proposed bug locations and their intended behaviors are speculative and based on an understanding of the issue description alone. To resolve the issue effectively, one would ideally gather more precise context about how `attrs` and type hints are used within the codebase and how Sphinx, along with the `napoleon` extension, is configured."
