This involves specifically addressing how `polylog` terms are expanded without introducing unnecessary or incorrect mathematical entities such as `exp_polar(-I*pi)`. The intended behavior should ensure that for cases like `polylog(2, Rational(1,2))`, it expands correctly according to known mathematical identities without resorting to defaults that leave the expression unchanged or incorrectly altered. It should correctly simplify to `-log(2)**2/2 + pi**2/12` where applicable, following the mathematical principles of polylogarithms and their expansions."
