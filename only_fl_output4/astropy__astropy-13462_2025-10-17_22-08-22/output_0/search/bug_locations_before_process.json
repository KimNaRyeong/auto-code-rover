        "intended_behavior": "The `two_sum` method is designed to add two floating-point numbers (`a` and `b`) accurately, returning the sum and the exact floating-point error. The intended behavior at this location is to ensure that the algorithm correctly handles extreme floating-point values (very large or very small) such that the symmetry property (`two_sum(a, b) == two_sum(b, a)`) holds true regardless of the inputs. This might involve investigating if there's an edge case that's not adequately handled by the current implementation and adjusting the calculation method to accommodate or mitigate the effects of floating-point arithmetic limits. The function should be robust against the order of operands, maintaining accuracy and precision even in edge cases, thus preserving the existing functionality while enhancing its reliability for all input ranges."
