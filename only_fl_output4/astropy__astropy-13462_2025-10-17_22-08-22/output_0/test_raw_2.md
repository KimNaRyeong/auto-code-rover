Given the requirement and the prior confusion about the `numpy` module's involvement, let's try again by directly integrating everything needed to reproduce the originally described issue using the `print_stacktrace` function accurately, while also correctly handling the potential absence of `numpy`. This script will attempt to reproduce the issue described in the Astropy test case, including the use of `numpy` for the assertion.

Assuming the actual logic of `two_sum` from the Astropy project is more complex and specific to numerical computations involved, the following snippet is a stand-in that's oriented towards mimicking the environment and call structure. For actual debugging or replication in a precise manner, replace the placeholder logic in `two_sum` with the relevant implementation from the Astropy project or ensure the logic here specifically reflects the issue encountered with the floating-point computations:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def two_sum(f1, f2):
    # Assume numpy is necessary for the implementation
    import numpy as np
    # This is a placeholder for the implementation of two_sum. Replace with actual logic.
    result = f1 + f2
    if np.isfinite(result):
        return (result, 0)
    else:
        return (np.nan, np.nan)

def test_two_sum_symmetric(f1, f2):
    import numpy as np  # Import here to catch if numpy is not available
    try:
        # Perform the test logic as per the original issue's description
        result1 = two_sum(f1, f2)
        result2 = two_sum(f2, f1)
        np.testing.assert_equal(result1, result2)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise exception to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Floating point values from the issue's description
        f1 = -3.089785075544792e+307
        f2 = 1.7976931348623157e+308
        test_two_sum_symmetric(f1, f2)
        print("Test passed, no issue detected.")
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate success (no issue detected)
    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Required module not found: {e.name}. Please ensure all dependencies are installed.")
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate the missing module
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch and handle any other exceptions raised during test execution
        print(f"Test failed: {e}")
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate test failure or issue presence
```

This script aims to closely simulate the testing scenario described, including a direct way to verify the failure condition through raising and catching an `AssertionError`, while also providing detailed traceback information if the test fails. Before running, make sure the required dependencies (like `numpy`) are correctly installed in your environment to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.
