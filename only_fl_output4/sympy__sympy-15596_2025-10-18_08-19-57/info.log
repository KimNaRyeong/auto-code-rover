This calculation must correctly handle cases where the numerator and the denominator are both polynomials, potentially returning a negative degree if the denominator has a higher degree than the numerator. Additionally, the function should perform checks to reliably identify rational functions and handle them appropriately, either directly within `degree` or through auxiliary functions designed to manage rational expressions. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality of handling pure polynomial inputs while extending the method to correctly deal with rational function inputs."
