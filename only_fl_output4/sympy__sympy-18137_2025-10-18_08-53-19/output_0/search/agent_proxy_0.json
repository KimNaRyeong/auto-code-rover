            "content": "To address the issue, we need to look into several parts of the codebase related to the classes and methods mentioned in the stack trace. To effectively gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, we can use a combination of search queries as follows:\n\n1. To understand how the `Range` class, which appears to be problematic when its `intersect` method is called with a `FiniteSet`, is implemented, especially its `_contains` method which is directly involved in the exception:\n   - `search_class(\"Range\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_contains\", \"Range\")`\n\n2. Given the stack trace involves operations related to set intersection and containment checks where the error ultimately arises, we should look into the `Intersection` class and `fuzzy_and` function, as these are key components in processing the intersection operation:\n   - `search_class(\"Intersection\")`\n   - `search_method(\"fuzzy_and\")`\n\n3. Since the `FiniteSet` class is also mentioned, and it's part of the operation causing the issue, understanding how this class is defined and how its `contains` method is implemented might provide insights into how intersection checks are performed:\n   - `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"contains\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n\n4. The error message mentions \"cannot determine truth value of Relational\". It might be beneficial to understand how relational truth values are handled within the code. Examining the `Relational` class could provide relevant insights:\n   - `search_class(\"Relational\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__nonzero__\", \"Relational\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__bool__\", \"Relational\")` \n\nThese queries are aimed at providing a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue, their implementations, and how they interact with each other during the set intersection operation involving a symbolic range and finite set."
