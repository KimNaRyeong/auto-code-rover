Based on the requirements and the provided format for printing stack traces, here is a corrected implementation of `reproducer.py`. Keep in mind that this script assumes the presence of the issue and will handle its occurrence correctly according to your instructions. 

```python
from sympy import Range, FiniteSet, Symbol
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
    try:
        Range(1).intersect(FiniteSet(n))
    except TypeError as e:
        if "cannot determine truth value of Relational" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced correctly.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is present
    print("No issues detected.")
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 when the issue is fixed
```
This script defines a `check_issue` function that attempts to reproduce the reported issue. This function is called within a `try-except` block that captures the `TypeError` associated with the inability to determine the truth value of a relational operation inside SymPy. When the specific issue is encountered, it uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display details of the stack trace.

Please make sure that SymPy is installed in your Python environment, as this script depends on it to reproduce the issue. You can install SymPy using pip if it's not already available:

```sh
pip install sympy
```

Run this script in the root directory of your project with Python 3 to verify the issue. If the script exits with code 0, it indicates that the issue has been reproduced successfully, following your original request. If it exits with code 1, it suggests that the issue may have been resolved or the reproduction conditions have changed.
