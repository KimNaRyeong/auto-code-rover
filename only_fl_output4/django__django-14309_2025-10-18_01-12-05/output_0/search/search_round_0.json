        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about several components mentioned in the issue description. These include the `Q` class, and how the `Exists` lookup interacts with it, particularly in negated conditions. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Search for the Q class:** Understanding the `Q` class is fundamental since the issue revolves around its behavior when combined with an `Exists` lookup, both in negated and non-negated forms.\n   - `search_class(\"Q\")`\n\n2. **Search for the Exists class or lookup:** Since the issue specifically mentions an unexpected interaction between `Q` and negated `Exists`, understanding the implementation of `Exists` will be necessary.\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n\n3. **Search for the combination method in the Q class:** Since the issue describes a problem when using a bitwise AND (`&`) operation between `Q()` and `Exists()`, it's important to look into how the `Q` class handles combination with other query expressions, particularly looking for methods involved in this operation.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__and__\", \"Q\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__invert__\", \"Q\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide critical insights into how `Q` objects are combined with other objects, and specifically how negated states are handled. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for pinpointing where the logic fails for the described issue and will lay the groundwork for crafting a fix."
