        "intended_behavior": "The `FCodePrinter` class needs to be enhanced to properly handle the `sign` function in expressions. Specifically, this would involve either adjusting the `_print_Function` method or adding a new method specifically designed to handle the `sign` function (`_print_Sign`). This new or updated method should ensure that whenever the `sign` expression is encountered during the code generation process, it is translated into Fortran syntax correctly as `SIGN(1, x)` for integers or `SIGN(1.0d0, x)` for floating-point numbers, depending on the argument's datatype. This method would check for the `sign` function and output the correct Fortran code, taking into account the specifics of the function's implementation in Fortran (i.e., the requirement for two arguments where the first argument determines the result's magnitude, and the second determines its sign). By implementing this fix, `FCodePrinter` will be able to generate valid Fortran code for expressions involving the `sign` function, thereby preserving its existing functionality while ensuring compatibility and correctness for this specific case."
