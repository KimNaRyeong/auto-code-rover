To address the request while ensuring a comprehensive testing environment within a standalone script, we're going to embed Django setup, model definition, and serialization attempt in a single Python file, `reproducer.py`.

This script will deliberately attempt to serialize a `django.db.models.query.Row` instance using `pickle`, capturing the error as required. The script ensures a Django environment is setup on execution, includes model definition, performs database migration, creates an instance, and finally attempts the pickling operation that's expected to fail, demonstrating the reported issue. If the issue persists (i.e., pickling fails), it will print a stack trace; otherwise, the script will exit with code 0, indicating no issue.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
import pickle
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup Django
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',
    ),
)

django.setup()

# Define a simple model
class ModelA(models.Model):
    value = models.CharField(max_length=12)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

# Create tables
from django.core.management.commands.migrate import Command as MigrateCommand
MigrateCommand().execute()

# Attempt to reproduce the issue
try:
    ModelA.objects.create(value="Example")

    # Grabbing an instance with values_list(named=True) to create a Row object
    row = ModelA.objects.values_list('id', 'value', named=True).first()
    # Try to pickle it
    try:
        pickled_row = pickle.dumps(row)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue has been fixed
        print("No issue detected: The Row object is pickleable.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except pickle.PicklingError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code indicates failure/error

```

### Explanation:
- **Django Setup**: The script configures Django to use an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity and to avoid external dependencies.
- **Model Definition**: A minimal model, `ModelA`, is defined for testing purposes.
- **Issue Reproduction**: The script creates an instance of `ModelA` and fetches it using `values_list(named=True)` to produce a `Row` instance, simulating the user's reported scenario. It then attempts to pickle this instance.
- **Error Handling**: If the instance cannot be pickled (thus reproducing the issue), a custom `print_stacktrace` function is called to meticulously output the traceback details. If the instance is successfully pickled, it implies a resolution or non-existence of the reported issue in the current environment, exiting with code 0.

Execute this script in your project root directory via the command line using `python3 reproducer.py`. Remember, this script assumes a working Django environment where Django is already installed.
