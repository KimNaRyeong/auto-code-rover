        "intended_behavior": "The `combine` method in the `Query` class is intended to merge two `Query` instances into one, while preserving the semantics defined by the `connector` (AND/OR). To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should ensure:\n\n- **No Circular References in `change_map`**: Modify the logic that constructs and uses `change_map` to prevent the creation of circular references. This might involve adding checks or redesigning the alias relabeling logic to detect potential circular mappings before applying them. \n\n- **Deterministic Behavior:** Given the non-deterministic nature of the crash likely related to the ordering of data structures, the method should work consistently across executions for the same input. This could necessitate changes to how sets and dictionaries are iterated or merged, ensuring that the operation's outcome does not inadvertently rely on the iteration order.\n\n- **Preservation of Existing Functionality:** Any modifications to `combine` must not disrupt its current capabilities, especially its handling of merging query conditions, alias management, and enforcement of query constraints (e.g., model compatibility, filter capability, distinctness). The method should continue to support complex query scenarios without introducing regressions.\n\n- **Enhanced Error Handling and Validation:** Introduce better error handling or assertions specifically tailored to catch invalid states early. This could include more descriptive messages or checks that help diagnose how and why invalid `change_map` states arise.\n\nThese modifications aim to fix the non-deterministic crashes by addressing the root cause(s) related to alias relabeling logic and data structure order dependencies, ensuring that `Query.combine` works reliably for complex queries."
