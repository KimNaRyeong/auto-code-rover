        "intended_behavior": "This method currently warns and adapts when encountering an asynchronous iterator in a setting where a synchronous iteration is expected. To resolve the issue, the method should also effectively handle synchronous iterators in an asynchronous context, especially when Django is running under ASGI. The intended behavior should include checking for the operational context (ASGI or WSGI) and adapting the iterator accordingly without raising unnecessary warnings. This could involve implementing a new mechanism or enhancing the existing one to automatically convert synchronous iterators to asynchronous ones when serving content asynchronously, ensuring seamless async delivery of streaming content."

        "intended_behavior": "Since this method sets whether the iterator is synchronous or asynchronous, it should ensure compatibility with ASGI environments specifically for serving static files. Upon setting '_iterator', the method might need to encapsulate sync iterators in an async wrapper conditionally, based on whether the response is being served in an asynchronous context. This ensures that '_iterator' can be utilized directly in async iterations (e.g., in '__iter__') without further adaptation or warnings. Additionally, logging or conditional warnings could be refined to better guide developers towards best practices for async content serving, rather than warning against common patterns that might be unavoidable in certain cases."
