Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\nThis is because FileResponse is not async compatible (nor is that likely, since neither is open()).\nA new project with:\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\"daphne\",\n...\n]\nASGI_APPLICATION = \"project.asgi.application\"\nrunserver, and then visit any page serving static files such as /admin/.\nThe fix is to have ASGIStaticFilesHandler adapt the iterator in the same way StreamingHttpResponse does.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, let's plan to collect the relevant code context by invoking specific search API calls. The key elements mentioned in the issue are \"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\", \"StreamingHttpResponse\", \"FileResponse\", and the warning generated regarding the use of synchronous iterators. Given these elements, the following API calls will provide the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class to understand its current implementation and to identify where the integration with `StreamingHttpResponse` or `FileResponse` might be happening, which leads to the warning:\n   - `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`\n\n2. Since `StreamingHttpResponse` is mentioned as having added async support and being involved in the warning, it's critical to look at its implementation or any recent modifications related to async behavior:\n   - `search_class(\"StreamingHttpResponse\")`\n\n3. Understand `FileResponse` implementation to see if there's a straightforward way to make it async compatible or if there's an existing workaround for async usage:\n   - `search_class(\"FileResponse\")`\n\n4. Locate the specific warning message within the codebase. This could help identify the exact point in the code where the issue arises, potentially in `http/response.py` or related to how `StreamingHttpResponse` handles synchronous iterators:\n   - `search_code(\"StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators in order to serve them asynchronously. Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to gather comprehensive information about how `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, `StreamingHttpResponse`, and `FileResponse` are implemented and interact with each other, as well as to pinpoint where the problematic warning is triggered in the codebase. This context will facilitate the development of a patch or workaround."
