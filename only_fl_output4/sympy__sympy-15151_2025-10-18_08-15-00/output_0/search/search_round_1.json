The method `pretty_print` found in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` looks to be a central piece of functionality for rendering expressions in a visually pleasing manner. This method takes an expression and various formatting options to customize the output, including line wrapping, number of columns before line breaks, usage of Unicode, precision, ordering, and the use of a compact square root character. \n\n**Relationship with the bug**: Given the issue pertains to the pretty printing of indexed variables, this method is highly relevant. It indicates that the module responsible for pretty printing (in this case, something under `sympy/printing/pretty`) potentially lacks the logic or has a bug when it comes to handling indexed variables specifically.\n\n**Intended behavior**: For the specific concern raised in the issue, the intended behavior would likely involve modifying or ensuring that `pretty_print` (and possibly the underlying `pretty` method it calls) correctly identifies and formats indexed variables in the expected mathematical notation (e.g., \"x_{1,i}\"). This suggests that the bug's resolution may include enhancements or fixes within this method or related methods to ensure indexed variables are formatted correctly.\n\n2. The various `render` methods found in `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` could potentially be related to rendering different mathematical or vector-related objects into a readable or graphical format. However, without more specific details on their implementation, it's hard to directly correlate them with the issue at hand.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps could involve:\n- A deeper dive into the `pretty_print` method and possibly the `pretty` method it wraps. This could include looking at how these methods handle expressions, particularly indexed expressions, and identifying any shortcomings or bugs in the current logic.\n- Investigating how indexed expressions are passed to and processed by `pretty_print` to pinpoint where the formatting diverges from the expected outcome.\n\nAdditional investigations might involve:\n- Exploring specific rendering logic in the identified `render` methods to see if they intersect with the rendering of expressions that include indexed variables.\n- Checking how indexed variables are represented internally within SymPy, as this could affect how they are identified and handled during pretty printing.\n\nGiven this analysis, appropriate API calls to further understand the codebase might include:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")` to see more usage or definitions related to pretty printing within the same file.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\", 2346, 10)` to understand more about the environment surrounding the `pretty_print` function declaration.\n- Analysis or review of how expressions, specifically indexed expressions, are represented in SymPy which could involve searching the codebase for relevant class definitions or method implementations that deal with expression parsing or construction."

The code should maintain its existing functionality for all other types of expressions while adding or refining the logic to handle indexed variables correctly. This could involve adding a conditional branch or modifying an existing one within the pretty printing logic to detect when the expression includes an indexed variable and apply the correct formatting rules.\n    \nAdditional context around how expressions are constructed or represented, particularly for indexed expressions, was not deemed necessary based on the issue description and initial findings.
