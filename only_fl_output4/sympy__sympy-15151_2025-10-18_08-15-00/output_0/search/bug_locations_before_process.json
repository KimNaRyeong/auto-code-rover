        "intended_behavior": "This method, responsible for pretty printing of expressions, should be enhanced to specifically check and properly format indexed expressions like 'indexed(x1, i)' into the desired mathematical notation, e.g., 'x_{1,i}'. The code should maintain its existing functionality for all other types of expressions while adding or refining the logic to handle indexed variables correctly. This could involve adding a conditional branch or modifying an existing one within the pretty printing logic to detect when the expression includes an indexed variable and apply the correct formatting rules."
