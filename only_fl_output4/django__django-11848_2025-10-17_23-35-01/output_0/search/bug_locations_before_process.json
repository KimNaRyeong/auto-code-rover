        "intended_behavior": "The existing functionality of interpreting two-digit years should be preserved, but it needs to be adjusted to align with the directives of RFC 7231. This adjustment involves dynamically determining the century of a two-digit year based on the current year. If a two-digit year, when interpreted as being in the 20th or 21st century, appears to be more than 50 years in the future, it should instead be interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits. Specifically, this means replacing the simplistic check that statically assigns a century to a two-digit year, with a more sophisticated logic that: 1. Retrieves the current year. 2. Compares the two-digit year with the last two digits of the current year. 3. If the computed year (with the century assumed as 1900 or 2000 added) is over 50 years ahead of the current year, it should instead treat it as the most recent past year with the same last two digits. This change ensures compliance with RFC 7231 and addresses potential misinterpretations of two-digit years, thereby resolving the stated issue."
