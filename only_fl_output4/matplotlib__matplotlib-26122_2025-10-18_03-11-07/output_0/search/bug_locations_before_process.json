        "intended_behavior": "The `imshow` method should include additional logic to handle the `aspect` parameter conditionally based on the `transform` argument. Specifically, if a `transform` is provided and it is not equal to `ax.transData`, the method should interpret an `aspect=None` argument as an instruction not to modify the axes aspect ratio. This change preserves the existing functionality for all cases where `transform` equals `ax.transData` or is not provided, which would maintain backward compatibility while addressing the issue raised. An explicit check for the `transform` argument needs to be introduced, and based on this check, the method should conditionally set the aspect ratio only if `transform` aligns with `ax.transData`, or otherwise leave the aspect ratio unaltered if `aspect=None`."
