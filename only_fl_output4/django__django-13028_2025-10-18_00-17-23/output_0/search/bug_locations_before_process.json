        "intended_behavior": "The `check_filterable` method should be modified to ensure that it differentiates between Django ORM's internal use of the `filterable` attribute and model fields named `filterable` defined by the users. A potential approach to achieve this is to introduce a separate internal attribute or mechanism for determining if a field is filterable according to the ORM's logic, rather than relying directly on the field's attributes which might conflict with user-defined model fields. This modification would preserve the existing functionality by still allowing proper checks for whether fields are filterable in queries, but without the unintended side effect of conflicting with model field names. This can ensure that custom field names like `filterable` do not inadvertently affect the ORM's behavior, thus resolving the issue without breaking the ORM's intended constraints on filterable expressions."
