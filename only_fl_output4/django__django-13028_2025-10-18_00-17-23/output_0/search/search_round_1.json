        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights into the Django ORM's behavior and how it might relate to the reported bug. Let's break down the information obtained from the `check_filterable` method found in the Django codebase.\n\n### Analyzed Context from `check_filterable` Method\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `check_filterable` method in Django's `Query` class is designed to ensure that expressions (or fields) used in a `WHERE` clause of a database query can actually be filtered on. It checks if the given expression has a `filterable` attribute set to `True`. If not (`filterable` is either `False` or not present, and thus defaults to `False` because of the `getattr` with a default of `True`), the method raises a `NotSupportedError`, indicating that the attempted filter operation is not permitted on the given expression.\n\nThe method also checks if the expression can have source expressions (essentially, if it's a compound expression that might involve multiple fields or database expressions) and recursively verifies that all component expressions are filterable.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe reported issue occurs when filtering `ProductMetaData` objects by a `ProductMetaDataType` instance, where `ProductMetaDataType` has a boolean field named `filterable`. The error is triggered because Django's `check_filterable` method checks if an expression is allowed in a `WHERE` clause by looking for a `filterable` attribute on the Django model field instance. Since the `ProductMetaDataType` model explicitly declares a field named `filterable`, it unintentionally sets `filterable` to `False` (or whatever the field's value is), leading Django to believe this field should not be used in a filter, hence raising a `NotSupportedError`.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior of `check_filterable` is to prevent the use of non-filterable expressions in a query's `WHERE` clause for database efficiency and query correctness reasons. It's designed with the assumption that model fields would not conflict with its internal attribute checks. In the context of this issue, the intended behavior would be for Django to disregard the model's specific field attributes when checking if an expression is filterable and base the check on Django ORM's field definitions and capabilities rather than on model-defined attributes.\n\n### Next Steps for Patch Development\n\nGiven this analysis, a potential patch could involve modifying the Django ORM to distinguish between internal attribute checks and model-defined fields more clearly, ensuring that ORM functionality doesn't clash with user-defined model fields like `filterable`. Alternatively, a workaround could be to rename the model's `filterable` field to avoid this conflict, although this would not prevent similar issues in the future with different field names. \n\nTo proceed, exploring Django's ORM field definition and how queries are constructed to see if there's an existing mechanism or an alternative approach for handling these attribute checks would be the next logical step. We should investigate how fields are defined and how Django's ORM constructs its queries, which might reveal a mechanism for an elegant fix or a more robust workaround. \n\nNo additional API calls have been identified as immediately necessary based on the current analysis, but understanding the broader context of Django ORM's field handling and query construction could require further investigation into related methods and classes."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

A potential approach to achieve this is to introduce a separate internal attribute or mechanism for determining if a field is filterable according to the ORM's logic, rather than relying directly on the field's attributes which might conflict with user-defined model fields. This modification would preserve the existing functionality by still allowing proper checks for whether fields are filterable in queries, but without the unintended side effect of conflicting with model field names. This can ensure that custom field names like `filterable` do not inadvertently affect the ORM's behavior, thus resolving the issue without breaking the ORM's intended constraints on filterable expressions."
