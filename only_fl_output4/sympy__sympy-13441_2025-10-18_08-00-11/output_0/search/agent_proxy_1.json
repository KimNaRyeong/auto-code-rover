This could involve introducing optimizations like caching intermediate results or employing a more efficient algorithm for traversing and counting operations in an expression. The method should maintain accuracy in counting operations while minimizing the computational overhead for large symbolic expressions.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`, Method: `jacobian`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `jacobian` computation must be optimized to handle large matrix expressions more efficiently. Possible improvements include optimizing the use of `diff` and `_eval_derivative` methods to reduce redundant computations, especially in the context of large systems where the Jacobian computation currently becomes a bottleneck. The optimization should ensure that the calculated Jacobian remains accurate but is computed in a way that significantly reduces the computational load and execution time, particularly for expressions involving a large number of derivatives.\n\n- **Location 3:** File: `sympy/core/expr.py`, Method: `diff`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Given its central role in differentiation, `diff` may need to be optimized for scenarios involving large expressions. This could involve better handling of expressions to minimize computation before applying differentiation, simplifying expressions where possible before the differentiation process, or employing more efficient algorithms for symbolic differentiation. The goal is to preserve the method's current functionality, ensuring accurate differentiation, while improving performance for complex or large expressions.\n\nOptimizing these methods should address the performance issue without altering their core functionalities. Implementing such optimizations would likely resolve the reported slowdown, particularly in computing Jacobians for large systems, enabling `count_ops` to operate more efficiently under such conditions."
