This Python script, `reproducer.py`, is aimed to reproduce the issue described, relying on detecting performance issues (like hanging or being significantly slow) within the `count_ops` or related computational tasks. 

**Note:** The actual reproducibility might depend on the computational complexity and how "slow" or "hanging" is defined quantitatively. This script assumes that the execution will hang or be significantly slowed down by the `jacobian` call on a complex system (represented by `n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)`). However, without a specific timeout or performance benchmark, "slow" is somewhat subjective. Moreover, since the issue revolves around computational performance, the environmental conditions (like hardware and background processes) can affect the reproduction of this issue.
