Certainly! Below is a standalone python file named `reproducer.py` designed according to your instructions. This script checks for the specific issue described (raising a `UnicodeError` when it should raise an `InvalidURL` error instead), and uses the provided function to print the stack trace for clarity on the error's origin.

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests
from requests.exceptions import InvalidURL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_invalid_url_issue():
    try:
        # Attempt to make a request that is expected to raise an InvalidURL due to its incorrect format.
        requests.get("http://.example.com")
    except InvalidURL:
        # This is the correct behavior, so we confirm the issue is fixed.
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except UnicodeError as e:
        # If a UnicodeError is caught, then it means the issue is still present.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue present: Caught UnicodeError instead of InvalidURL.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling unexpected exceptions.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_invalid_url_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

To use this script:

1. Save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Run it using the command `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script should exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, indicating that an `InvalidURL` error is correctly raised for the given input. If the issue is still present, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and a stack trace will be printed for debugging purposes.
