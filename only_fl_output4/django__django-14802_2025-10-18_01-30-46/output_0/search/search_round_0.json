So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To fully address the issue and gather sufficient context for resolving it, we need to understand the existing structure and usage of `make_key` and `validate_key` methods, and where they are called from within the cache backend. Specifically, we'll need to locate the base cache backend class and investigate how these methods are currently being implemented and used.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for `make_key` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us identify all the places where `make_key` is defined or overridden, providing insights into its usage patterns and any custom implementations in various cache backends. \n\n   `search_method(\"make_key\")`\n\n2. **Search for `validate_key` method in the entire codebase**: Similar to `make_key`, this search will reveal where `validate_key` is implemented and used across the project, highlighting how key validation is handled in different parts of the system.\n\n   `search_method(\"validate_key\")`\n\n3. **Search for code snippets where `make_key` and `validate_key` are used together**: This will help us to understand the context in which these methods are currently used in tandem, which is essential for understanding how the proposed helper function should be integrated.\n\n   `search_code(\"self.make_key(key, version=version)\\nself.validate_key(key)\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good overview of the current implementation and usage patterns, setting a solid foundation for introducing the new helper method effectively."
