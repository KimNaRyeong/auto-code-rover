So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `make_key` Method:\nThe method `make_key` found in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` within the `BaseCache` class is responsible for constructing the cache key that is used across various cache-related operations. The method accepts two parameters: `key` (the original cache key) and `version` (an optional version number for the key). It constructs the key by using a specified `key_func` that typically prepends a `key_prefix` and the `version` to the original key. If no version is provided, the default `version` associated with the `BaseCache` instance is used.\n\n**Relation to the issue**: This method is part of the workflow that the issue aims to optimize by ensuring that `validate_key` is consistently called after `make_key`. The proposed helper function, `make_and_validate_key`, would encapsulate the functionality of `make_key` and immediately follow it with a call to `validate_key`, streamlining the key construction and validation process.\n\n### 2. Analysis of `validate_key` Method:\nAlthough specific details were not provided for the `validate_key` method, it was found in both `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` and `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py`. This distribution suggests that `validate_key` is a fundamental method intended for ensuring the integrity or validity of cache keys, which exist in the base backend as well as specialized implementations (like memcached).\n\n**Relation to the issue**: The method is crucial for maintaining cache consistency and preventing potential cache-related errors or security issues. The issue recognizes the repetitive pattern of these methods being called in sequence and proposes to encapsulate this pattern into a single method. Such optimization could enforce best practices and reduce redundancy.\n\n### 3. No Direct Findings of Sequential `make_key` and `validate_key` Usage:\nThe search for direct sequential usage of `make_key` and `validate_key` (i.e., one after the other without any code in between) returned no results. This outcome implies that while the pattern is recognized as repetitive by the issue's submitter, it may not occur as a two-line sequence directly in the codebase. It's possible that the current usage involves additional logic or variations in how these methods are called.\n\n**Next Steps for Context Gathering**:\nGiven the absence of direct examples in the search results for the sequential use of `make_key` and `validate_key`, the next steps could involve a broader search to understand how these methods are typically used within cache operations. Considering the detailed findings:\n\n1. **Investigate Use Cases of `make_key` and `validate_key` Individually**: Since the direct sequence wasn't found, examining individual uses of these methods could provide insights into their typical contexts and the potential integration points for the new helper method.\n   \n   - `search_code(\"self.make_key(\")`\n   - `search_code(\"self.validate_key(\")`\n\n2. **Review Extended Context Around `make_key` and `validate_key` Definitions**: This can reveal comments, adjacent methods, or other indications of intended usage patterns or the rationale behind the current implementation structure.\n\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/cache/backends/base.py\", 95, 10)`\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/cache/backends/base.py\", 105, 10)`\n\nThese steps are designed to fill in the gaps from the initial search results, offering a more comprehensive view of how `make_key` and `validate_key` are currently utilized and how they might be seamlessly combined into the proposed helper function within the cache backend mechanism."

This new method should first construct a cache key using the existing `make_key` method, taking a `key` and an optional `version` as parameters. After constructing the key, it should immediately validate the constructed key by calling the existing `validate_key` method. This encapsulation ensures that every time a key is made, it is also validated according to the backend's rules, thus streamlining the usage and maintenance of cache keys and reducing code repetitiveness across the cache backend implementations.\n    - Proposed Method Signature and Logic:\n      ```python\n      def make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None):\n          \"\"\"\n          Constructs and validates a cache key.\n          \n          This helper function combines the actions of making and validating a cache key,\n          ensuring that all keys are properly validated immediately after creation.\n          \n          :param key: The original key to be used for cache operations.\n          :param version: The optional version number for the key.\n          :return: A valid cache key that has been constructed based on the provided parameters\n                   and validated according to the backend's validation rules.\n          \"\"\"\n          key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\n          self.validate_key(key)\n          return key\n      ```\n\nThis new method directly addresses the issue at hand by reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent application of key construction and validation logic across various cache operations. This enhancement not only improves code quality and maintainability but also ensures the integrity and consistency of cache key handling throughout the Django cache backend system."
