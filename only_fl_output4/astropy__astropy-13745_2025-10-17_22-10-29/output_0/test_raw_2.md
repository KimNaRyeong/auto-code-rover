Given your earlier feedback that the previous script did not execute due to a lack of a necessary module (`numpy`), it seems there was a misunderstanding or an environment setup issue. This can often happen if necessary dependencies are not installed in your environment. Before attempting to run the script, ensure that all required libraries, including `numpy` and `astropy`, are installed in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy astropy
```

Assuming your environment is now correctly set up, I'll provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that includes proper error handling and correctly incorporates the printed stack trace function inside the script body. This should work as intended when `numpy` and `astropy` are correctly installed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from astropy.coordinates import Latitude

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latitude_with_float32():
    lat_value = np.float32(np.pi/2)
    try:
        Latitude(lat_value, 'rad')
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Test Failed: The issue is still present.")
    else:
        print("Test Passed: No exception raised.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_latitude_with_float32()
```

To reiterate the use case:
- Place this script in the root directory of your project where you're testing Astropy.
- Ensure that your Python environment has both `numpy` and `astropy` installed.
- Run the script with Python 3 using the command `python3 reproducer.py`.

The expected behavior of this script, as described, is to raise an `AssertionError` if the `Latitude` initialization fails due to the `float32` representation of pi/2 issue. Conversely, if Astropy or your modifications handle this case gracefully, it will print "Test Passed: No exception raised."
