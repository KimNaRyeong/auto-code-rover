Based on the output provided earlier, it seems there might have been an oversight in detecting the issue successfully. I'll now offer a revised version for the `reproducer.py` script, ensuring it correctly handles the reproduction of the reported issue. This script will explicitly assert the presence of the problem by triggering the error and catching it effectively.

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    try:
        from sympy import symbols
        from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
        
        # Define symbols
        E, L, F, B, H = symbols('E, L, F, B, H')
        I = B * H**3 / 12  # Moment of inertia for a rectangular cross-section
        
        # Initialize the Beam
        b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
        
        # Apply loads and support
        b2.apply_load(-F, L / 2, -1)
        b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")
        
        R0, M0 = symbols("R_0, M_0")
        b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)
        
        # Attempt to generate shear force representation
        # This is where the issue should manifest
        b2.shear_force()
    
    except TypeError as e:
        if "_print_SingularityFunction() got an unexpected keyword argument 'exp'" in str(e):
            # Correctly identified the specific issue
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present") from e
        else:
            # Some other TypeError occurred
            print("An unexpected TypeError occurred; this might not be the tracked issue.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Any other exception suggests the reproducer might need adjustment
        print("An unexpected error occurred, which may not relate to the reported issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    else:
        # If no exception is thrown, it suggests the issue might have been resolved
        print("No issue detected, the reported problem seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please make sure that this updated `reproducer.py` script is executed in an environment where the error has initially been observed. If the issue has been fixed in a newer version of the library you are using, or due to any other changes in your environment, this script might exit with code 0, indicating no issue detected.
