But the first connection will not be closed by browser for very long time.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context required for resolving the issue about `runserver` failing to close connections when `--nothreading` is specified, we can target our search around the Django development server handling and how it deals with threading and connections. We'll need to investigate the implementation of the development server (`runserver` command), specifically focusing on how it manages connections, particularly with regard to the `--nothreading` option.\n\nGiven this, we'll search for:\n\n1. The implementation of the `runserver` command to understand how the `--nothreading` option is handled.\n2. The WSGI server Django uses for the development server (`runserver`), likely to be the `WSGIServer` class or something similar.\n3. Any relevant connection handling or socket reading logic that may be affected by threading options.\n\nLet's invoke the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`: To find the method or command handler for `runserver`, this is where the handling of the `--nothreading` option would be defined or passed down to the server.\n- `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`: Assuming Django's development server uses a class like `WSGIServer`, which is common in WSGI applications, to manage requests.\n- `search_code(\"--nothreading\")`: To find references to the `--nothreading` option within the codebase. This can help us identify how this option influences the server's behavior.\n- `search_method(\"handle_request\")`: To check if there's a specific method for handling requests that might be relevant for understanding how connections are kept alive or closed."
