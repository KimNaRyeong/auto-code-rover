Since the `search_method` call did not find `bell`, it suggests that `bell` may not be implemented as a method but rather as a function or part of a class in the SymPy codebase. This oversight can be addressed by adjusting our approach to search for the `bell` function correctly.\n\nThe results did provide valuable insights into where the `limit` method is used within the SymPy library. The `limit` method is crucial for calculating the limits of sequences or functions, and it appears in multiple locations:\n\n1. **sympy/matrices/matrices.py**: While this is related to matrices, it's unlikely directly relevant to our issue regarding the `bell` function's limit.\n2. **sympy/series/limits.py**: This seems like a central place for handling limit calculations for various functions and could be directly relevant to our issue.\n3. **sympy/functions/special/hyper.py**: Though this file deals with special functions, including hypergeometric, unless `bell` is somehow implemented under or utilizes hypergeometric functions, it might not be directly relevant.\n4. **sympy/core/expr.py**: Given that this is part of the core expression handling in SymPy, alterations here could potentially impact how limits are evaluated across the board, including for the `bell` function.\n\nGiven the issue description and intended behavior (i.e., evaluating `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` to infinity rather than returning `bell(oo)` unevaluated), the next steps should focus on finding the implementation details of the `bell` function to understand how it's currently handling the infinity case. Additionally, gaining more insight into how the `limit` method works, particularly in `sympy/series/limits.py`, might reveal why the current implementation fails to evaluate the limit of the `bell` function as expected.\n\nConsequently, the next API calls should aim to:\n\n1. **Search for the Bell function implementation.** This requires adjusting the original search strategy, perhaps looking for it as a class or function rather than a method.\n2. **Gain more context on how limits are calculated, especially in relation to special functions like `bell`.** Checking the implementation details in `sympy/series/limits.py` could be particularly insightful.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"bell\")`: To correctly locate the implementation of the `bell` function.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"bell\", \"sympy/functions/special\")`: This assumes `bell` might be located in a special functions directory.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"limit\", \"sympy/series/limits.py\")`: To understand the specific implementation of limit calculations that could affect how `bell`'s limits are evaluated."
