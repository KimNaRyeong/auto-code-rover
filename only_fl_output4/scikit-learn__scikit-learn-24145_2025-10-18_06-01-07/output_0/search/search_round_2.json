        "content": "The collected context from the provided API calls gives us the following insights and next steps towards addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Location and Structure of `SplineTransformer`:** The `SplineTransformer` class is found in `sklearn/preprocessing/_polynomial.py`. It derives from `TransformerMixin` and `BaseEstimator`, and it includes methods for initialization, fitting the model, transforming data, and more. However, there isn't a direct `fit_transform` method found within the class. In scikit-learn, the `fit_transform` method is often inherited from a mixin, which explains why a direct definition in the `SplineTransformer` class couldn't be found. The `fit_transform` behavior for this class is likely the default implementation, which combines `fit` and `transform` methods sequentially.\n\n    - **Relationship to the Issue:** Since the request is to modify `fit_transform` to enable sparse output, the actual modification might need to take place within the `transform` method or require the explicit implementation of `fit_transform` within the class to include a conditional that checks for the `sparse` attribute and acts accordingly.\n\n2. **Absence of `fit_transform` Definition in `SplineTransformer`:** There is no customized version of the `fit_transform` method within `SplineTransformer` which aligns with the scikit-learn pattern of providing `fit` and `transform` separations and relying on `TransformerMixin` for the default `fit_transform` behavior. \n\n    - **Intended Behavior:** While not mentioned explicitly, the issue suggests that the intended behavior for the `sparse` parameter, when set to `True`, should alter how `transform` (or by extension `fit_transform`, due to its automatic sequence of `fit` followed by `transform`) operates. This might necessitate either a condition within `transform` to decide the output type or a unique `fit_transform` method that considers `sparse`.\n\n3. **Use of `design_matrix` in relation to `SplineTransformer`:** The `design_matrix` references in `sklearn/linear_model/_ridge.py` might not be directly related to the implementation strategy for `SplineTransformer`, but it indicates that `design_matrix` is already utilized within the scikit-learn project, likely for similar functionality related to generating matrices based on input features. This is especially relevant given the issue's mention of using `design_matrix` with scipy >= 1.8.\n\n    - **Intended Behavior in Context:** Since `design_matrix` is already used in the codebase, its integration into `SplineTransformer` would presumably not only follow similar implementation patterns (for consistency and leveraging existing code design) but also highlight the need for ensuring compatibility with the specified scipy version. An additional implementation detail to consider will be how the `design_matrix` fits into generating sparse outputs, implying that the implementation should conditionally leverage `design_matrix` functionalities based on the `sparse` attribute.\n\nGiven these insights, the immediate next step will involve reviewing the implementation details of the `transform` method within `SplineTransformer` and considering an explicit implementation or modification of `fit_transform` that can handle the `sparse` output logic. Additionally, examining the implementation and usage of `design_matrix` in `_ridge.py` would provide a reference for how to utilize it effectively in the context of generating sparse or dense outputs from transformations.\n\nTo dive deeper and fill in the gaps, I recommend these follow-up API calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"SplineTransformer\")`: To get details on the current implementation of the `transform` method, which is likely where modifications are needed to support sparse outputs.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"design_matrix\", \"sklearn/linear_model/_ridge.py\")`: To understand how `design_matrix` is currently used, which might provide insights into how it can be integrated into `SplineTransformer` for supporting the proposed feature."

Where are bug locations:\n- **Location 1:** File: sklearn/preprocessing/_polynomial.py, Class: SplineTransformer, Method: transform\n    - **Intended Behavior:** The `transform` method should be modified or extended to support returning sparse matrix output when the `sparse=True`. This involves adjusting the method to conditionally use scipy's `design_matrix` functionality (or similar logic) to produce a sparse matrix output based on the new parameter. The existing functionality, which likely produces a dense ndarray by default, should be preserved when `sparse=False`, thus ensuring backward compatibility.\n    \n    - Additionally, considering the issue's mention of scipy >= 1.8, it may be necessary to include version checks or dependencies to ensure compatibility with the `design_matrix` usage or alternative solutions designed for generating sparse matrices. \n\n- **Note:** Since the `fit_transform` method was not explicitly found within `SplineTransformer`, and given scikit-learn's typical usage patterns, it's presumed that the default `fit_transform` provided by `TransformerMixin` (which internally calls `fit` and then `transform`) is adequate. Therefore, modifying the `transform` method to account for the `sparse` parameter should inherently address the issue when `fit_transform` is called. If further investigation reveals that an explicit `fit_transform` method is necessary to properly handle the sparse output, then that would constitute an additional location for modification. However, based on the information provided, making the necessary adjustments within `transform` appears to be the initial point of intervention."

The goal is to understand the modifications needed to support a sparse matrix output.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `transform` method converts input data `X` into B-splines features. For each feature in the input data, it calculates spline transformations and outputs a dense numpy array `XBS` of shape `(n_samples, n_features * n_splines)`. The calculation involves handling different types of extrapolations (`continue`, `error`, `periodic`, `constant`, and `linear`), ensuring that the transformed data fits within predefined boundaries and behaves appropriately outside of those boundaries based on the selected extrapolation method. The output format is currently fixed as a dense numpy array.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n    - The main issue is that the current implementation only supports outputting dense numpy arrays and does not provide an option for a sparse matrix output. Since B-splines naturally have a sparse structure for many datasets, having a dense output can be memory-inefficient, particularly with large datasets or when the number of splines is high. The issue requests the addition of functionality to allow users to opt for a sparse output format, which would be more storage and computation efficient in scenarios where many of the matrix elements are zeros.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n    - The intended behavior would involve extending the `transform` method to conditionally return a sparse matrix based on a user-specified parameter (e.g., `sparse=True`). This will likely involve modifying the data structure used to store the transformed features from a dense numpy array to a structure suitable for sparse data, such as those available from `scipy.sparse`. The method would need to be adapted to accumulate results in a sparse format efficiently when this option is selected. Care would have to be taken to ensure that this does not significantly impact the performance or complexity of the code when the dense output is requested. Additionally, it might require importing and leveraging functionality from `scipy.sparse` to build the sparse matrix correctly based on the transformed spline features. The current dense numpy array (`XBS`) creation and manipulation within the loop (lines 956-1043) would be the main target for modification to support this new feature.\n\nTo achieve this modification while preserving the existing functionality:\n- A new parameter, such as `sparse`, would need to be introduced at the initialization of the `SplineTransformer` class, allowing users to specify the desired output format.\n- The transformation logic would need to be adapted to create and populate a sparse matrix when this parameter is set to `True`. The numpy operations that fill the `XBS` array with B-spline transformations would need replacements or adaptations suitable for sparse matrix operations.\n- It's important to ensure that the changes introduce minimal overhead when the dense output format is still chosen, to not negatively impact current users of the class who rely on dense output.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps to draft a patch would involve designing these modifications, ensuring backward compatibility, and maintaining the performance and usability standards of the scikit-learn library."

Where are bug locations:\n- **Location 1:** File: sklearn/preprocessing/_polynomial.py, Class: SplineTransformer, Method: transform\n    - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be modified to support an additional optional parameter (`sparse`: `bool`, default=`False`) that, when set to `True`, enables the method to return a sparse matrix output instead of a dense ndarray. This involves:\n        - Introducing logic to conditionally construct and populate a sparse matrix (`scipy.sparse`) based on the transformed spline features. This might involve initializing a sparse matrix before the loop that iterates over each feature, and then, within the loop, rather than directly modifying a dense array, updating the sparse matrix with non-zero values calculated during the transformation.\n        - Ensuring that all current extrapolation handling (`continue`, `error`, `periodic`, `constant`, `linear`) is compatible with sparse matrix output. This may require implementing equivalent logic that applies to the construction of the sparse matrix.\n        - Preserving the existing functionality and performance when `sparse=False`, maintaining backward compatibility for existing users of the `SplineTransformer`.\n        - Additional parameters for controlling the sparse matrix format could be considered to provide flexibility to the user. However, the simplest implementation would involve choosing a sensible default sparse format (e.g., CSR or CSC) that balances memory efficiency with the performance of subsequent operations likely performed on the output."
