        "content": "To effectively address the issue regarding the \"Symbols\" sections in the HTML output and the handling of index entries with special characters, let's gather relevant context from the codebase using the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand how index entries are processed and categorized into different sections, including \"Symbols\", we need to identify the classes and methods responsible for generating the index for the HTML output. We can start by searching for a method that might be directly responsible for this functionality, such as something related to index processing or HTML generation. \n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"generateIndex\")\nsearch_method(\"createIndex\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that symbols like \"@\", \"\u00a3\", and \"\u2190\" are categorized into separate \"Symbols\" sections with the same HTML anchor, it's important to understand how symbols are classified and how anchors are generated. This could be handled in a method related to sorting or categorizing entries, or directly within the index generation logic.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"categorizeIndexEntries\")\nsearch_method(\"sortIndexEntries\")\n```\n\n3. The issue description suggests a problem with how entries starting with certain symbols are handled differently, leading to two \"Symbols\" sections instead of one. There might be specific code handling these symbols. Searching for these symbols in the codebase might reveal custom logic for handling index entries starting with special characters.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"_@_\")\nsearch_code(\"_\u00a3_\")\nsearch_code(\"_\u2190_\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to understand how the indexing logic is structured and where the issue might arise from."
