These calls will target methods and classes within the Django codebase related to the bug described. Specifically, I will focus on areas of the Django ORM and SQLite backend that are responsible for table creation and schema management, as these are directly implicated in the issue.\n\n1. The traceback mentions classes and methods in the SQLite3 backend (`sqlite3/base.py` and `sqlite3/schema.py`), and the migrations infrastructure (`db/migrations/`). I'll start by searching for the schema editor class for SQLite3 since it's crucial for table creation and modification, and where the issue seems to originate.\n\n2. The error occurs during a migration, so examining the `Migration` class, the `apply_migration` method in `migrations/executor.py`, and the specific operations involved in adding a field or creating a table could provide valuable context.\n\n3. Given the detailed traceback, it's clear that methods like `_remake_table` and `create_model` play a significant role in the issue. Hence, identifying their definitions and implementations will offer insights into how quoted names might be mishandled.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"SchemaEditor\")` to find the schema editor class for SQLite3 backend.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"apply_migration\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")` to get context on how migrations apply changes to the database schema, particularly for SQLite.\n- `search_method(\"create_model\")` since it's part of what causes the error, and it would be important to understand its implementation across the SQLite3 backend.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_remake_table\", \"SchemaEditor\")` and `search_method_in_class(\"create_model\", \"SchemaEditor\")` to explore the implementations of these methods specifically in the context of modifying and creating tables, which are relevant to the issue with quoted table names."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let\u2019s delve into the returned results and address the mentioned questions for each significant part.\n\n### Analysis of `apply_migration` in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `apply_migration` method forwards a migration. This process involves several key actions:\n- Check if the migration should be faked or if it's an initial migration that has been previously applied (\"soft applied\").\n- If not faking, it executes the migration using the `schema_editor`.\n- Records the migration as having been applied, to maintain the migration history.\n- Optionally, it can invoke a callback function to report on the migration application's progress.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nThe method uses a `schema_editor` within a context manager to apply migrations. Given the traceback mentioning a failure during a migration that involves creating or altering a table with quoted `db_table` names, it suggests that the way `schema_editor` interprets or handles these quoted names could be a part of the issue. Specifically, this process involves generating SQL statements that respect the database's quirks, including how table names are quoted.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nThe intended behavior would involve `apply_migration` successfully applying migrations for tables with quoted names by correctly handling or generating the appropriate SQL syntax for SQLite3. This behavior should be consistent irrespective of whether the table name is quoted, ensuring the database schema is accurately reflected in all supported databases.\n\n### Analysis of `create_model` method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `create_model` method found in several backends, including the base schema backend, is primarily responsible for generating the SQL commands to create new database tables based on the Django model definitions. This means translating Django model fields and options into database-specific column types, constraints, and table properties.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nGiven that our issue occurs when attempting to create a model with a quoted table name that includes a foreign key, the `create_model` implementation across different database backends could provide insight into how these quoted names should be handled specifically for SQLite3. Since the issue manifests in the SQLite backend, it's likely that the SQLite-specific implementation of `create_model` (or possibly a related utility method that it calls) mishandles the quoting in some way.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nThe intended behavior for the `create_model` method should include correctly handling quoted table names, ensuring that any SQL generated for SQLite3 (or any supported database) follows the proper conventions for quoting identifiers. This would entail either stripping unnecessary quotes before processing or ensuring the SQL syntax for defining the tables honors the quotes as intended, preventing syntax errors.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nSince `SchemaEditor` couldn't be directly found, and it plays a critical role in applying schema changes like migrations, further steps should involve:\n\n1. Directly examining the implementations of `create_model` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` since it's likely the base implementation that Django's SQLite backend extends or utilizes. This could provide a foundation for understanding the general approach to creating models and where the handling for quoted table names might be improved.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"create_model\", \"django/db/backends/base/schema.py\")\n```\n\n2. Investigate the SQLite-specific schema editor, given that the detailed traceback points towards SQLite's execution of a problematic query. Since the initial search for `SchemaEditor` was not successful, we might need to explore alternative ways to identify the SQLite schema editor or related components directly involved in processing model creation for SQLite. This could involve searching for known SQLite3 backend classes or methods directly implicated in schema editing.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"sqlite3/base.py\")\nsearch_code(\"sqlite3/schema.py\")\n```\n\nThese steps aim to pinpoint precisely where Django's handling of quoted table names in SQLite migrations fails, setting the stage for identifying a viable fix."

The likely method(s) that need examination are those involved in table creation, such as `create_model`, or any SQLite-specific implementation that handles quoting of table names.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior:** The code at this location should correctly handle quoted table names when generating SQL for migrations. This involves ensuring that quotes around table names are properly managed to prevent syntax errors in SQL statements. For instance, if a table name is provided with quotes (e.g., '\"table_with_quoted_name\"'), the implementation should either strip these quotes and handle them internally in a consistent manner or correctly use them in generated SQL such that SQLite does not throw a syntax error. The code must ensure that foreign key constraints and other SQL elements that reference the table name maintain valid syntax. The resolution should preserve the functionality to handle both quoted and unquoted table names seamlessly during migrations.\n\nThis analysis and proposed solution center on the assumption that the SQLite schema editor in Django contains logic for generating and executing SQL statements based on model definitions, which includes handling of table names, fields, and relationships. Fixing how this SQLite backend component deals with quotes could resolve the migration errors when dealing with quoted `db_table` names."
