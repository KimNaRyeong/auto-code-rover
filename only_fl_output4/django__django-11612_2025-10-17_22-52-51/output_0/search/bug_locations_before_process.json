        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location should correctly handle quoted table names when generating SQL for migrations. This involves ensuring that quotes around table names are properly managed to prevent syntax errors in SQL statements. For instance, if a table name is provided with quotes (e.g., '\"table_with_quoted_name\"'), the implementation should either strip these quotes and handle them internally in a consistent manner or correctly use them in generated SQL such that SQLite does not throw a syntax error. The code must ensure that foreign key constraints and other SQL elements that reference the table name maintain valid syntax. The resolution should preserve the functionality to handle both quoted and unquoted table names seamlessly during migrations."
