This preserves the existing functionality of logging changes while enhancing readability for admin users. The implementation must iterate through the fields mentioned in the message, checking each against the model's fields for verbose names, and replacing the technical field name with the verbose name before the message is finalized and logged."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to log_change, log_addition requires adjustments to use verbose names instead of or in addition to field names in the message parameter. Since additions might not specify field changes as detailed as modifications do, this method may require logic to include relevant verbose name information in a usable format when objects are created. Incorporating a check or transformation that maps any field names referenced directly or indirectly in the message to their verbose names ensures that log entries are more accessible and understandable to admin users."
