However, this is not currently the case. For example, consider a model with the following class variable:\npub_date = models.DateTimeField(\"date published\")\nChanging the publication date for an object of that model, will display \"Changed pub_date.\" in its admin history, rather than \"Change date published.\" as one would expect (as older versions of Django did).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the models history not using verbose names in the admin section, we need to understand how the project implements logging or tracking changes in models, particularly how it labels these changes in the admin history. Since Django admin logs are involved, looking for where the project handles these logs or overrides admin behaviors would be beneficial. The description mentions the interaction with model fields and their verbose names, so we should look into areas where model definitions and Django admin hooks intersect.\n\nFirst, it would be useful to understand how the project defines model fields and if there's a custom implementation or method that handles changes to model fields. The \"pub_date\" field example given in the issue might indicate either a custom model method or Django admin customization is not correctly using the `verbose_name` of model fields.\n\nHere are the API calls that I would start with:\n\n1. Search for the model class definition that includes the \"pub_date\" field to understand how models are defined and to look for any custom method that might be related to logging changes:\n   - `search_code(\"pub_date = models.DateTimeField\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that this functionality is not working within the admin section, it is likely there's either a custom admin method or a signal that handles the logging of changes. Admin history changes often involve overriding methods or utilizing Django's signals framework, so let's look for a custom admin class or methods that might deal with history or logging:\n   - `search_code(\"admin.ModelAdmin\")`\n   - `search_code(\"LogEntry\")`\n\n3. Given the nature of the issue, there might be specific methods that handle the creation of log entries for the admin history. These methods might be using the field names directly instead of their verbose names. It would be valuable to find methods that are responsible for generating these log messages:\n   - `search_method(\"log_change\")`\n   - `search_method(\"log_addition\")`\n\nThese searches should offer a comprehensive view of both how models are defined in the context of this issue and how changes to models are logged in the admin history, including any custom admin behavior or mechanisms for logging model changes."
