Instead, if the object it is comparing to is not a Django Model, it automatically returns False.\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/models/base.py#L526\nAccording to the Python 3 data model reference, a __eq__ should return NotImplemented\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__\nIf a.__eq__(b) returns NotImplemented, then b.__eq__(a) will be tried. If both return NotImplemented, then an is check is performed, and if that fails it returns False.\nThis may seem like a relatively innocuous difference, but it can cause some nasty bugs. The most obvious is that for testing,\n<A Django Model> == mock.ANY returns False, since by not returning NotImplemented it never even looks at the overridden __eq__ on ANY.\n</issue>"

This determination is made by first checking if the other object being compared is an instance of a `Model`. If not, it returns `False` immediately. If it is a model instance, it then checks if both instances belong to the same concrete model class and, if so, compares their primary keys (`pk`). If the primary keys are identical, it returns `True`; if the primary key is `None`, it falls back to identity comparison (i.e., checks if they are the same instance).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue arises from the method's immediate return of `False` when the `other` object being compared is not an instance of a `Model`. According to the Python data model, in such cases, a method should return `NotImplemented` instead of `False` to allow the comparison to be delegated to the other object's `__eq__` method, or to fall back to the default comparison behavior if no suitable `__eq__` is found. This behavior ensures compatibility and correct behavior across different types and subclasses in Python, preventing the kinds of bugs mentioned in the issue description, such as an erroneous comparison result when using `mock.ANY` for unit tests.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would be for the `__eq__` method to return `NotImplemented` when the `other` object is not an instance of a `Model`. This change would respect Python's protocol for binary special methods, allowing Python to handle the comparison more appropriately by trying `other.__eq__(self)` if available, or defaulting to identity comparison if both comparison attempts return `NotImplemented`. This adjustment would resolve the subtle bugs caused by the current implementation and make it more compliant with Python's expected behavior in equality checks, especially important in polymorphic situations or when using test doubles/mocks.\n\nThe next step towards crafting a patch would involve modifying the `__eq__` method to return `NotImplemented` when `other` is not an instance of a `Model`, aligning with Python\u2019s best practices and resolving the bugs associated with the current implementation."
