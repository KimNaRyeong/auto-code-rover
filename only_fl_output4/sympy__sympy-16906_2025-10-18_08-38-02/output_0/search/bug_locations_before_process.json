This involves defining how `OneMatrix` instances are converted to their string representation (simple, human-readable form), pretty printed (enhanced readability, possibly with Unicode characters), and represented in MathML format (for web display and other applications requiring MathML). The methods should preserve the general functionality of matrix expression printing in sympy, ensuring that `OneMatrix` is represented accurately as a matrix of ones of the given dimensions."

It should use Unicode double struck characters when the `use_unicode` setting is enabled.

The intended behavior is to enable `OneMatrix` objects to be converted into MathML format, adhering to standards for mathematical markup language. This would facilitate integration with systems and applications requiring MathML, thus enhancing the utility and compatibility of `OneMatrix` expressions. Implementing this could involve creating a new method or updating existing ones within the sympy printing mechanisms to detect and correctly process `OneMatrix` instances for MathML output."
