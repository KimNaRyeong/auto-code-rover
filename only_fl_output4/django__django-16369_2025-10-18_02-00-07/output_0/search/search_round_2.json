        "content": "By reviewing the results from the initial search, we can gather that the Sitemap generation functionality and i18n configurations are spread across various parts of the Django framework. This gives us a more focused area for deeper investigation. Specifically, the files `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py` are likely involved in Sitemap generation, while files like `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py` are more aligned with internationalization (i18n) functionalities. The presence of matches in both contexts suggests an existing integration point we need to understand better to tailormake the solution for the described issue.\n\n1. **Analysis of Sitemap Related Files:**\n   - Files under `django/contrib/sitemaps/` are definitely where the Sitemap generation logic resides. This part of the code is responsible for configuring and generating Sitemaps according to the Django project's requirements. Given that Sitemaps are instrumental in SEO by listing URLs provided by a site, the logic for how URLs (and, implicitly, their corresponding content) are selected for inclusion in the Sitemap is crucial here.\n\n2. **Analysis of i18n Related Files:**\n   - The files like `django/views/i18n.py` suggest where Django handles i18n mechanisms for rendering views in multiple languages based on user preferences or default settings. The issue's description points to a challenge in linking these i18n capabilities with the Sitemap's generation in a way that respects language-specific content availability. Essentially, the goal would be for this part of the code to intelligently include or exclude certain items from the Sitemap based on their availability in the requested language, which may involve custom logic beyond the current i18n and Sitemap generation integration.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Considering the issue description, the intended behavior would be to enhance the current Sitemap and i18n integration to allow for conditional item inclusion based on language. This implies either extending the existing Sitemap generation logic to consult more closely with i18n settings or introducing new configurations/interfaces that would let developers specify the availability of certain content in specific languages, thus preventing errors or dead links in the Sitemap for languages where some content might not be available or translated.\n\nTo proceed, we need specific sections of the code that deal with how Sitemaps are currently generated, especially in relation to i18n. This requires looking into:\n\na. How `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py` implement Sitemap generation.\nb. How `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py` configure and manage i18n, particularly regarding URL resolution and content selection based on language.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Investigate the Sitemap generation process by looking into the method definitions in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py`.\n- Understand i18n URL handling and content selection mechanism by inspecting relevant methods or configurations in `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py`.\n\nSuggested API calls to make:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_urls\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"set_language\", \"django/views/i18n.py\")`"

However, I will proceed with a hypothetical analysis based on typical patterns in Django's handling of sitemaps and i18n.\n\n2. **where are bug locations:**\n   - **Location 1:** \n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n     - **Class:** Likely a class that extends `Sitemap` or similar.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This class or module should be extended to include logic that decides whether to include a URL in the sitemap based on its availability in the requested language. This might involve adding a method or altering an existing one to filter out items not translated into the current language. This logic should preserve existing functionality by defaulting to the current behavior when no language-specific rules are defined.\n   \n   - **Location 2:** \n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py`\n     - **Method:** Likely in a method that generates the sitemap entries, such as `get_urls`.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `get_urls` method (or wherever the URL generation logic resides) to consult the possibly extended Sitemap logic (from Location 1) to filter out non-available language content. This requires incorporating i18n awareness directly into the sitemap generation process, ensuring that each URL is validated against its i18n availability before being added.\n\nGiven the speculative nature of these locations and intended behaviors without specific method details, the actual implementation might require additional modifications or entirely different approaches depending on how the Django project has implemented i18n and Sitemap generation functionalities."

This class is essential for generating the sitemap, a file that details all URL addresses available on a site, aiding search engines in their crawling efforts.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `Sitemap` class provides a series of configurations and methods to customize the generation of a sitemap. Key functionalities include:\n- Setting a limit on the number of URLs (in line with Google's specifications),\n- Specifying whether the URLs should include protocol explicitly,\n- Enabling i18n to generate URLs for all configured languages,\n- Allowing for the inclusion of alternate/hreflang links for multi-language sites,\n- Determining URLs, their priorities, last modification dates, etc.\n\nNotably, the class includes mechanisms for handling internationalization (i18n), such as creating URL entries for each available language and incorporating alternate languages' links through hreflang attributes (indicative of content available in multiple languages).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue described concerns the limitation in displaying items in the sitemap based on language; specifically, the existing functionality does not support conditional item display per language. Based on the snippet, the `Sitemap` class has foundational support for i18n through the `i18n` and `alternates` flags but lacks fine-grained control to exclude items not intended for or available in certain languages.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nTo address the described issue, the intended behavior would involve enhancing the `Sitemap` class to support conditionally filtering items for inclusion in the sitemap based on language availability. This could be achieved by:\n- Expanding the logic within the `_items` and `_location` methods to allow for excluding items not available in specific languages, rather than the current behavior which indiscriminately generates (item, lang_code) tuples for all items across all languages.\n- Providing a mechanism, perhaps through an override-able method or an additional configuration option, that lets the developer specify conditions under which items should be included in the sitemap for each language. This could involve, for example, a method that accepts an item and a language code and returns a boolean indicating whether the item should be included for that language.\n\nThis targeted adjustment would preserve the existing functionality\u2014maintaining a global view of all items across all languages when no exclusion criteria are specified\u2014while offering the necessary flexibility to accommodate the described use case of selectively displaying items per language."

These enhancements should allow selective display of items in the sitemap based on their language availability without affecting the existing functionality for users who do not require this feature.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\n1. **Location 1:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n   - **Class:** `Sitemap`\n   - **Method:** `_items`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The `_items` method currently returns a list of all items for all languages when `i18n` is enabled. The intended behavior is to enhance this method with additional logic to filter out items not available in certain languages. This could involve introducing a filter method or lambda function as an attribute of the `Sitemap` class that developers can override to define per-item and per-language availability. This method would check each item's availability for each language and only include those items that are meant to be displayed for the languages in question. The default behavior (if no filter is defined) should remain as currently implemented, including all items for all languages.\n\n2. **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n   - **Class:** `Sitemap`\n   - **Method:** `_location`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** While the `_location` method primarily focuses on generating the URLs for the items, considering the new logic added to `_items`, it might not require significant changes. However, ensuring that the logic in `_items` for filtering based on language carries through effectively to item URL generation will be crucial. If any additional filtering or adjustments are needed to ensure that only valid, language-specific URLs are generated, those should be incorporated here. This means double-checking that the items being processed by `_location` have already been filtered for language availability. Essentially, there should be congruence between the items listed and their corresponding URLs, reflecting the correct availability per language.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the Django project will support more granular control over which items appear in the sitemap based on language, addressing the issue without disrupting the existing functionality for those who do not need this feature. This approach gives developers the flexibility to define custom behavior for multi-language sites, particularly useful for content that is not uniformly available across all languages."
