To create a cohesive `reproducer.py` file as requested, we need to understand the desired behavior precisely.

Given the instructions, the file should:

1. Set up a condition to run two tests â€“ one with the original django `Media` implementation and one with a modified `CustomMedia` class.
2. Raise an `AssertionError` if the original implementation exceeds a reasonable performance threshold (which specifically indicates the issue is present).
3. Use the provided `print_stacktrace` function to clearly display stack trace information if an assertion error is caught.
4. Ensure the script exits with code 0 only when the issue is not present in the modified implementation.

Let's craft the script accordingly:

```python
# reproducer.py
import datetime
from django.forms import Media

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

def perform_test(MediaClass):
    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(MediaClass)
    for i in range(10000):  # Adjusted to 10,000 for a realistic threshold
        media = media + create_media(MediaClass)
    duration = datetime.datetime.now() - start
    print(f"{MediaClass.__name__} 10,000 additions took: {duration}")
    return duration.total_seconds()

def main():
    original_duration = perform_test(Media)
    # Arbitrary performance threshold for demonstration purposes
    assert original_duration < 60, f"Performance issue detected with original implementation: {original_duration} seconds"

    class CustomMedia(Media):
        def __add__(self, other):
            combined = CustomMedia()
            if len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:
                combined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]
            else:
                combined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists
            if len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:
                combined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]
            else:
                combined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists
            return combined

    modified_duration = perform_test(CustomMedia)
    # Ensure modification resolves performance issue.
    try:
        assert modified_duration < 60, f"Performance issue detected with modified implementation: {modified_duration} seconds"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error if the modified implementation still shows the issue

    print("No performance issue detected with modified implementation.")
    exit(0)  # Exit code 0 if the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This standalone Python script should be executed within a Django environment since it imports `Media` from `django.forms`. The test counts and thresholds (for example, the `10000` loop iteration and the `60` seconds performance threshold) are set for demonstration purposes and may need adjustment based on the actual expected performance criteria and machine specifications mentioned in the original issue description.
