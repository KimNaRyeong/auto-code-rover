This could be achieved by introducing a way to evaluate session parameters or external configurations to decide the expiry age, while ensuring that if no dynamic rules apply, the method falls back to using the global SESSION_COOKIE_AGE setting. This ensures backward compatibility and preserves existing functionality for sessions that do not require dynamic expiry times."

It should be able to adjust the expiry date based on dynamic session data or an external source of configuration, with a fallback to the current behavior of using settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE to calculate the expiry date if no dynamic criteria are met."
