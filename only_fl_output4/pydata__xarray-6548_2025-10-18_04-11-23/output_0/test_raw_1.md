Given the output provided previously, it appears there was a critical misunderstanding regarding my role. My position does not include the capability to execute code directly or interact with systems or software outside of this conversation interface. My advice on handling tasks like reproducing issues in software must be based on knowledge up to my last training cut-off in September 2023.

Given this, I can provide you with an enhanced version of a standalone python file template for reproducing the initial issue with the `xr.polyval` function, which can manually be run in your environment to test if the issue persists or not. This script includes an explicit exit condition based on whether the exception is raised, matching your initial request:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    import sys

    coeffs = xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims="degree")
    coord = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], dims="x")

    try:
        xr.polyval(coord, coeffs)
        # If the preceding line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed.
        print("The issue is likely fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Asserting the presence of issue due to KeyError. The name attribute requirement is not met.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Maintains backward compatibility with original request behavior.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please remember to adjust this script as needed based on your specific runtime environment or if additional context about the issue becomes available. This script assumes you're running it in an environment where the relevant dependencies (Python, xarray, etc.) are correctly installed and set up.
