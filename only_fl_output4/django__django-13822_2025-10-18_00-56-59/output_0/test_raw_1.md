To create a more accurate and functional standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue as described, it is necessary to dynamically create Django models and try to generate migrations for them. This script dynamically creates models within two different Django apps that both define a model named `TestModel` with a `ManyToManyField` pointing to a shared model. The `related_name` is set to `'+'`, which should, according to the described issue, raise an error when Django attempts to create migrations.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from django.conf import settings
        from django.apps import apps
        from django.db import models

        settings.configure(
            INSTALLED_APPS=[
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'app1',
                'app2',
            ],
            DATABASES={
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': ':memory:',
                }
            },
            USE_TZ=True,
        )

        django.setup()

        # Base model to be used in ManyToMany relation
        class SharedModel(models.Model):
            name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

            class Meta:
                app_label = 'shared'

        apps.register_models('shared', SharedModel)

        # Dynamically create two models with the same name in different apps
        for app_label in ['app1', 'app2']:
            class TestModel(models.Model):
                shared = models.ManyToManyField(SharedModel, related_name='+')

                class Meta:
                    app_label = app_label

            apps.register_models(app_label, TestModel)

        from django.core.management import call_command
        from io import StringIO

        out = StringIO()
        call_command('makemigrations', 'app1', 'app2', stdout=out, dry_run=True)
        if 'No changes detected' in out.getvalue():
            print("Issue may not be present, or models are not detected by Django. Further investigation is required.")
        else:
            print("Migrations can be created, did not reproduce the issue as expected. Check the setup and migrations.")
            
        out.close()

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import django
    main()

Please, ensure Django is properly installed in your environment (`pip install django`) before running this script. The script assumes a standard Django project structure but uses a temporary in-memory database and dynamically registers models in fake apps (`app1` and `app2`) to avoid the need for an actual Django project setup. This approach attempts to encapsulate everything required to reproduce the issue into a single Python script without external dependencies.

**Important Note:**
1. This script uses `settings.configure()` to define minimal settings required for Django to run. This means you don't have to place this script in a Django project directory.
2. It dynamically creates and registers two models in different apps (`app1` and `app2`), each with a `ManyToManyField` to a shared model using `related_name='+'`.
3. The script tries to run `makemigrations` with `dry_run=True` to check if the issue can be reproduced without affecting an actual database or project migrations.
4. It catches exceptions, printing them using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, but this does not guarantee the recreation of the described issue if it is environment or configuration-specific. Further details or adjustments might be required based on the specific conditions under which the issue occurs.
