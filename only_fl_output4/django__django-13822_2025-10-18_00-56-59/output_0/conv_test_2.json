The script assumes a standard Django project structure but uses a temporary in-memory database and dynamically registers models in fake apps (`app1` and `app2`) to avoid the need for an actual Django project setup. This approach attempts to encapsulate everything required to reproduce the issue into a single Python script without external dependencies.\n\n**Important Note:**\n1. This script uses `settings.configure()` to define minimal settings required for Django to run. This means you don't have to place this script in a Django project directory.\n2. It dynamically creates and registers two models in different apps (`app1` and `app2`), each with a `ManyToManyField` to a shared model using `related_name='+'`.\n3. The script tries to run `makemigrations` with `dry_run=True` to check if the issue can be reproduced without affecting an actual database or project migrations.\n4. It catches exceptions, printing them using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, but this does not guarantee the recreation of the described issue if it is environment or configuration-specific. Further details or adjustments might be required based on the specific conditions under which the issue occurs."
