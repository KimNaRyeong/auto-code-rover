Based on the description, it seems we are dealing with a machine learning framework or library similar to `mlxtend` that implements a Stacking Classifier. The new feature request is to add an option to include the original dataset features along with the predictions of the base estimators for the final estimator training. \n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for the class that implements the stacking functionality:\n\n1. `search_class(class_name: \"StackingClassifier\")`\n\nThis will help identify the main class that needs to be modified. \n\nNext, it's crucial to understand how the final estimator is currently being trained, so I need to locate the method responsible for this training process within the `StackingClassifier`:\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"fit\", class_name: \"StackingClassifier\")`\n\nLastly, since the issue suggests a feature toggle (boolean parameter) to switch between using only the predictions and using predictions with the original features, I'll check if there's an existing parameter handling mechanism in the `fit` method or elsewhere relevant:\n\n3. `search_code_in_file(code_str: \"use_features_in_secondary\", file_path: \"path/to/StackingClassifier\")`\n\nThe file path is a placeholder for now, as the actual path will be determined based on the first search result.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `StackingClassifier` Implementation\n\nThe `StackingClassifier` is defined within `sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py` and inherits from `ClassifierMixin` and `_BaseStacking`. It's designed to stack the output of multiple estimators and then fit a final estimator to these outputs. \n\n- **Current Behavior**: The constructor (`__init__`) accepts several parameters such as `estimators`, `final_estimator`, `cv`, etc., but there's no mention of a parameter that allows the use of the original dataset features alongside the predictions for the final estimator training. The `fit` method further elaborates on how the model is fitted using `X` (feature set) and `y` (target values).\n\n#### 2. Relationship with the Issue\n\nThe issue requests adding functionality to optionally include the original dataset (feature set `X`) in the training of the `final_estimator`. This feature is not currently present in the `StackingClassifier`, as evident from the absence of a parameter like `use_features_in_secondary`.\n\n#### 3. Intended Behavior\n\nThe desired feature involves modifying the `StackingClassifier` to optionally leverage the original dataset features in addition to the estimators' predictions when fitting the `final_estimator`. This suggests that the implementation should involve:\n\n- Introducing a new parameter (e.g., `use_features_in_secondary`) in the `__init__` method of `StackingClassifier`.\n- Adjusting the `fit` method to conditionally include the original features in the dataset passed to the `final_estimator`, based on the value of the new parameter.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the absence of the `use_features_in_secondary` parameter in the current implementation, the next steps should focus on pinpointing places within the `StackingClassifier` where adjustments are required to support this feature. This involves:\n\n- Modifying the `__init__` method to include the new parameter.\n- Adjusting the `fit` method (or possibly other internal methods involved in preparing data for the `final_estimator`) to implement the intended behavior.\n\nBefore proceeding to code modifications, it would be wise to:\n\n1. **Search the `_BaseStacking` class**: Since `StackingClassifier` inherits from `_BaseStacking`, understanding how data is prepared and passed to the `final_estimator` might require examining the base class.\n\n    - `search_class_in_file(\"BaseStacking\", \"sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py\")`\n    \n2. **Review how predictions are currently used**: Specifically, examine the method(s) responsible for generating the dataset for the `final_estimator` from the base estimators' predictions. This would involve looking at how the `fit` method of `_BaseStacking` (or related utilities/methods) is structured.\n\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py\")` (For `_BaseStacking` if it exists and is different from `StackingClassifier`).\n\nThese steps should provide the necessary context to understand where and how to incorporate the `use_features_in_secondary` functionality."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This parameter should default to `False`, preserving the current functionality. When set to `True`, it will indicate that the `final_estimator` should be trained using both the predictions from the base estimators and the original dataset features.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py`\n  - **Class:** `StackingClassifier`\n  - **Method:** `fit`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `fit` method to conditionally include the original dataset features along with the base estimators' predictions when training the `final_estimator`, based on the state of `use_features_in_secondary`. This involves creating a composite dataset that combines these two sources of input only if `use_features_in_secondary` is `True`, ensuring that the default behavior remains unchanged when this parameter is `False`.\n\nThe modification must ensure:\n- Compatibility with the existing API (e.g., handling of sample weights, if applicable).\n- Preservation of the current behavior when `use_features_in_secondary` is not enabled, to ensure backward compatibility.\n- Efficient handling of the combined dataset to avoid unnecessary performance overhead.\n\nThis approach aligns with the issue request for enhanced flexibility in training the `final_estimator`, potentially leveraging rich original features alongside learned predictions for better model performance."
