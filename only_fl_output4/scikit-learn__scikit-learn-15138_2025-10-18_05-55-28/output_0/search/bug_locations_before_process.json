This involves creating a composite dataset that combines these two sources of input only if 'use_features_in_secondary' is 'True', ensuring that the default behavior remains unchanged when this parameter is 'False'. The modification must ensure: Compatibility with the existing API (e.g., handling of sample weights, if applicable), Preservation of the current behavior when 'use_features_in_secondary' is not enabled, to ensure backward compatibility, Efficient handling of the combined dataset to avoid unnecessary performance overhead."
