Given the feedback and the requirements, let's make an adjustment to the initial `reproducer.py` script. This version will ensure that Sphinx is installed and called properly within the environment, aiming to capture the specific issue reported:

```python
# reproducer.py
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_env():
    try:
        # Check Sphinx version
        cp = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, check=True)
        version_info = cp.stdout.strip()
        print(f"Sphinx version: {version_info}")  # Just for verification

        # Setup minimal Sphinx project
        from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
        with TemporaryDirectory() as tempdir:
            with open(f"{tempdir}/conf.py", "w") as f:
                f.write("""
project = 'Test Project'
master_doc = 'index'
""")
            with open(f"{tempdir}/index.rst", "w") as f:
                f.write("""
.. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)
.. py:method:: g(a=2**4)
""")
            # Run Sphinx build
            cmd = ['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', tempdir, f"{tempdir}/_build"]
            cp = subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
            if "could not parse arglist" in cp.stderr:
                raise AssertionError("Issue with 'could not parse arglist' detected")
            elif cp.returncode != 0:
                print("Sphinx did not execute successfully. Review the configuration.")
                print(cp.stderr)
            else:
                print("No issue detected with Sphinx arglist parsing.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_sphinx_env()
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Explanation

This script does a few important things:

1. **Check Sphinx version**: It first verifies that Sphinx is correctly installed and captures its version. This is crucial because the issue might depend on the specific version of Sphinx.

2. **Set up a minimal Sphinx project**: It creates a temporary directory with a minimal `conf.py` and an `index.rst` containing the problematic code. This setup tries to mimic a real Sphinx project environment as closely as possible with the snippets provided in the issue.

3. **Run Sphinx build**: It then runs `sphinx-build` to generate the documentation. Any Sphinx-related errors or warnings during the build should surface here.

4. **Error Handling**: The script captures two main scenarios:
   - The presence of the specific warning message "could not parse arglist", which is directly related to the reported issue. An `AssertionError` is raised if this situation is detected.
   - Any other error related to Sphinx running process (for example, an incorrect Sphinx installation or environment setup), which might not trigger the specific issue but indicates a failure.

5. **Exit codes**: The script exits with code 1 if an issue is detected, allowing this behavior to be captured by automated testing environments. Otherwise, it exits with code 0, indicating success.

Please make sure that Sphinx is installed in your environment where you're running this script for accurate testing. If necessary, install Sphinx using pip:

```sh
pip install sphinx
```

Before running the script, ensure your Python and Sphinx environments are correctly set up to match the reported issue's context.
