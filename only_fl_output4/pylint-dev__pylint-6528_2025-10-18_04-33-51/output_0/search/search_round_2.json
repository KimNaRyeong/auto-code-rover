This could mean that the recursive behavior is either a default setting, implemented with a different naming convention, or controlled by a more general mechanism within the Pylint codebase that isn't directly tied to the exact string argument `--recursive=y`.\n\nThe result from searching for `--ignore` returning matches within `pylint/checkers/similar.py` is intriguing. This indicates that there's specific logic related to ignore functionality within a part of Pylint focused on checking for similarities, which might not be directly responsible for the file traversal and ignore logic in a broader sense. However, it's a starting point to understand how ignore patterns are implemented and could provide insight into how these patterns are being applied or perhaps missed during recursive directory traversal.\n\n### Next Steps for API Calls\nGiven the initial results and considering the necessary analysis, we should:\n\n1. Investigate how Pylint initializes its scanning process, especially how it decides which files or directories to include or exclude as this will give us insight into where the bug might lie in regards to not respecting ignore settings in recursive mode.\n\n2. Because the `--ignore-patterns` and `--ignore-paths` searches returned no results, it's possible these are handled differently than expected or are part of a larger configuration parsing mechanism. Understanding Pylint's configuration loading and parsing process could reveal how these arguments should be processed.\n\n3. The absence of direct hits for the recursive option hints that we should explore the codebase for file traversal or directory scanning logic, which may not necessarily explicitly reference the `--recursive` option.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the next API calls:\n\n- Search for general configuration loading or parsing logic which might involve all command-line arguments, including those for ignoring files.\n- Investigate how file or directory inclusion/exclusion is determined during the linting process to understand where the breakdown regarding ignored paths might occur.\n\nThus, the next API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_configuration\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`\n- `search_code(\"file_traversal\")`\n- `search_code(\"directory_scan\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify relevant parts of the code that are likely involved in processing the problematic behavior, even though the specific arguments returned no direct results."

Therefore, the following API calls are essential:\n\n1. `search_method(\"load_configuration\")`\n2. `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`\n3. `search_code(\"file_traversal\")`\n4. `search_code(\"directory_scan\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at uncovering parts of the code where the logic for handling recursive operations and applying ignore filters may reside.

Specifically, when Pylint runs in recursive mode, it must effectively filter out the files and directories specified by the ignore options before linting begins.\n\n### 2. Search Misses for `parse_arguments`, `file_traversal`, and `directory_scan`\nThe absence of results for `parse_arguments`, `file_traversal`, and `directory_scan` suggests that these operations might be named differently or structured in a manner that doesn't directly match these search terms.\n\n#### Next Steps for API Calls\nGiven these observations, we should refine our approach to get more context:\n\n- **For parsing arguments and configuring lint runs:** Since `parse_arguments` was not found, it's possible the argument parsing logic is integrated with the configuration loading process or labeled differently. Further exploration into how `load_configuration` interfaces with command-line arguments is needed.\n- **For file selection/exclusion logic:** The failure to find matches for `file_traversal` and `directory_scan` implies that Pylint might employ a different terminology or structure for its file handling logic. It would be beneficial to look for more general terms related to file handling, such as \"file selection,\" \"file processing,\" or even broader searches around configuration application or project scanning.\n\nBased on these insights, additional context could be gathered with the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"command-line\", \"pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"command-line\", \"pylint/config/arguments_manager.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"file selection\")`\n- `search_code(\"project scanning\")`\n\nThese refined searches are aimed at uncovering the underlying mechanisms for command-line parsing, configuration application, and the logic used to determine which files and directories are included or excluded during a recursive linting operation."
