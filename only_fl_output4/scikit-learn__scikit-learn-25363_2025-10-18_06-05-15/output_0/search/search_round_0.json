It makes sure that it will turn into an error if we forget to pass the config to `delayed`. The code will still be working if `joblib` decides to provide a way to provide a `context` and a `config`.\n</issue>"

Since the issue mentions a problem with passing explicit configuration to `delayed` and concerns about thread importing `scikit-learn` differently, it is important to look into the implementation of `Parallel` and `delayed`.\n\n   - `search_class(\"Parallel\")`\n   - `search_method(\"delayed\")`\n\n2. Given the mention of working on an alternative solution to an existing problem tagged as #25242, and the necessity to raise a warning, investigating how warnings are raised in the related context is critical.\n\n   - `search_code(\"raise warning\")`\n\n3. The issue also mentions a potential future compatibility with `joblib` regarding providing a `context` and a `config`. It will be beneficial to understand how configuration is currently being passed or handled within the contexts of `Parallel` and `delayed`.\n\n   - `search_code(\"Parallel config\")`\n   - `search_code(\"delayed config\")`\n\nThese API calls will help in gathering the necessary code context to address the issue effectively."
