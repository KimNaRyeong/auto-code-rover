        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `delayed` function to support passing and handling explicit configuration details relevant to parallel execution contexts. This involves potentially adding parameters or a mechanism to `delayed` and `_FuncWrapper` that allows for the encapsulation of configuration data obtained at the time of the `delayed` call. The functionality should ensure that if specific configurations are necessary for the execution in different threading contexts, these can be passed through and utilized effectively, without altering the existing functionality for users who do not need this feature. This could also involve adding checks to ensure configurations are passed when needed and raising warnings if they are omitted in scenarios where they are expected. The update must preserve the current behavior for cases where explicit configuration is not necessary, ensuring backward compatibility."
