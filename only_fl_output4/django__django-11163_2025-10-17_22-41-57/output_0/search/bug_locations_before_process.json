        "intended_behavior": "The check `if fields and f.name not in fields:` currently fails to properly account for when `fields` is an empty list, which should lead to returning an empty dictionary (no fields are intended for inclusion). The correct behavior would involve modifying this check to `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:` ensuring that an empty dictionary is returned when `fields=[]` is explicitly passed to `model_to_dict`. This modification preserves the original functionality while fixing the bug related to handling empty lists for `fields`."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the first location, the condition `if fields and f.name not in fields:` in `_save_m2m` method is likely to cause an analogous issue if `_save_m2m` is somehow reliant on the same logic for field inclusion based on the `fields` parameter. To maintain consistency and prevent potential bugs, this condition should also be evaluated as `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:`. Although the issue did not explicitly mention problems with `_save_m2m`, aligning its behavior with `model_to_dict` regarding handling of empty `fields` will ensure consistent and expected behavior across the framework when dealing with field inclusion logic."
