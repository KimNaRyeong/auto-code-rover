When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to whitespace in `CREATE INDEX` statements in Django, we can analyze the problem and select the most appropriate API calls based on the information provided. Here's a breakdown of what we need to find:\n\n1. **Location and Content of Partial Fix for Indexes Using Opclasses:** To understand the current implementation and the introduced bug, we should first look into the partial fix mentioned in the issue, which is linked to a ticket (#30903). This fix involves modifications to whitespace handling around index creation, particularly when opclasses are used.\n\n2. **`Columns` class and its `col_suffixes` Usage:** The issue mentions a specific behavior related to the `Columns` class and the use of `col_suffixes`. Understanding how `col_suffixes` is used will help in identifying the root cause and where the logic might be failing for ascending order vs. descending order, as well as handling opclasses correctly without introducing unwanted whitespace.\n\nGiven these points, the following API calls are necessary to gather more context and understand how the system currently handles these cases:\n\n1. **Review the Partial Fix and Code Related to the `Index` Class:**\n   - Since the `Index` class is central to the issue, examining how it's implemented will be crucial. This class might be modified by the commit linked to ticket #30903.\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`: To get an overview of where the `Index` class is defined and its implementation details.\n\n2. **Examine the `ddl_references.py` file for `Columns` class and `col_suffixes`:**\n   - The issue directly references `ddl_references.py` and mentions behavior around `col_suffixes`. Exploring this file and the `Columns` class will provide insight into how column suffixes (which seem to affect the whitespace in the SQL statement generation) are handled.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Columns\", \"ddl_references.py\")`: To find the `Columns` class within the specified file.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"ddl_references.py\", 87, 10)`: Since the issue points to a specific line in `ddl_references.py`, retrieving the code around this line will help understand the handling of `col_suffixes`.\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context to start working on identifying the root cause of the whitespace management issue in `CREATE INDEX` statements and how it relates to the use of opclasses and the handling of `col_suffixes`."
