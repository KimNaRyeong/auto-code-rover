        "intended_behavior": "The `scatter` method should be modified to detect when both singular (`linewidth`, `edgecolor`) and plural (`linewidths`, `edgecolors`) forms of the attributes are provided by the user. If both forms are detected for either attribute, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that providing both singular and plural forms is ambiguous and not allowed. This behavior will preserve the existing functionality by still supporting both singular and plural forms, but not simultaneously, which aligns with the goal of reducing confusion and potential errors from ambiguous argument specification. This error-raising check should occur before any processing of these attributes to ensure that the user is immediately made aware of the incorrect usage. The exact placement of this logic will depend on the current structure of the method, ideally at the beginning where argument validation is typically performed."
