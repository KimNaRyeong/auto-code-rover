The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To adequately address the issue, we need to understand how `plt.scatter` (which is likely a method within a class in the Matplotlib library) handles the specified attributes `linewidths`, `linewidth`, `edgecolors`, and `edgecolor`. Consequently, we should start by locating the definition of `plt.scatter` and examining its implementation to see how these attributes are parsed and prioritized. Based on the description of the issue, relevant Matplotlib source files or classes might directly handle these parameters. Let's proceed with the API calls:\n\n1. **Find the scatter method in the codebase**: The first step is to locate the `scatter` method. Since `plt.scatter` is commonly referred to in a context that suggests it is a high-level function, it might actually be part of a class that deals with plotting. The naming convention (`plt`) hints at Matplotlib's pyplot interface, so we are looking for a method within that context or something similar.\n\n2. **Search for code handling `linewidths`, `linewidth`, `edgecolors`, and `edgecolor`**: After finding where `scatter` is defined, the next step is to see how it deals with the mentioned attributes. This involves looking for these specific attribute names in the context of the `scatter` method to understand their handling and precedence logic.\n\nHence, the necessary API calls would be:\n- `search_method(\"scatter\")`\n- `search_code(\"linewidths\")`\n- `search_code(\"linewidth\")`\n- `search_code(\"edgecolors\")`\n- `search_code(\"edgecolor\")`\n\nThese calls aim to gather comprehensive context on how `scatter` is implemented and how it processes the single and plural forms of these attributes."
