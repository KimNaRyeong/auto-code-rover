While `sympify` seems to handle this parameter, the downstream effects post-parsing (especially when passed to simplify) need to preserve the non-evaluation intent. If necessary, additional flags or metadata could be attached to the parsed expression, indicating that it should resist simplification evaluations that would otherwise alter its structure."

The simplification process should identify parts of an expression where evaluation was supposed to be deferred and handle them accordingly, potentially bypassing certain simplifications that would alter the expression's intended form."
