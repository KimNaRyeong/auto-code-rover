        "intended_behavior": "The `ccode` function should be enhanced to handle the `sinc` function specifically since it is a common mathematical function not directly supported by C's `math.h`. This enhancement involves detecting `sinc` function calls in the expression to be converted and either implementing a direct translation to a `Piecewise` C code equivalent that manually expresses the `sinc` function as `sin(x)/x` when `x != 0` and `1` when `x == 0`, or providing an option in the `user_functions` argument where users can specify how to handle `sinc` transforms, predefining a template for `sinc` handling within `ccode`'s existing mechanisms. The solution should maintain the ability to handle all other expressions as currently implemented, adding support for `sinc` without affecting the conversion of other functions and expressions to C code."
