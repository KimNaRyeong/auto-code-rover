Given the clarification and the need to accurately reproduce an issue that was incorrectly approached in the previous script, we will create a new `reproducer.py` script. This script will better align with the provided description and focus on the aggregation issue specified.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count, Sum, Case, When, FloatField, F, OuterRef, Subquery
from django.db.models.functions import Round

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django configuration
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
    DATABASES={"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3", "NAME": ":memory:"}},
)

django.setup()

# Model definitions
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)

# Main logic to reproduce the issue
def reproduce_issue():
    # Example data setup
    a1 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 1")
    a2 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 2")
    a3 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 3")
    
    b1 = Book.objects.create(title="Book 1")
    b1.authors.add(a1, a2, a3)
    
    b2 = Book.objects.create(title="Book 2")
    b2.authors.add(a1, a2)
    
    b3 = Book.objects.create(title="Book 3")
    b3.authors.add(a1)

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue
    try:
        # This is simplified from the provided example to highlight the aggregation issue over annotated fields
        author_books = Author.objects.annotate(
            total_books=Subquery(
                Book.objects.filter(authors=OuterRef("pk")).annotate(
                    count=Count("pk")
                ).values("count")[:1],
                output_field=models.IntegerField()
            )
        )

        result = author_books.aggregate(
            total=Sum("total_books"),
            average_books=Case(
                When(
                    total=0,
                    then=0
                ),
                default=Round(Sum(F("total_books")) / Count("pk"), 2),
                output_field=FloatField()
            )
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    try:
        assert result['total'] is not None, "Aggregation failed, 'total' is None"
        assert result['average_books'] is not None, "Aggregation failed, 'average_books' is None"
        print("Success, the issue did not occur.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

### Key Points:

- This `reproduce.py` script defines a very basic Django setup with two models, `Author` and `Book`, closely related to your original description.
- The script attempts a slightly modified aggregation that should highlight the problem with aggregating over annotated fields and using those in a further calculation.
- The setup uses an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity and to ensure no external database setup is required.
- It should run standalone, provided Django is installed in the environment (`pip install Django`).
- If the Django 4.2x version indeed has the problem as described, this script will trigger an `AssertionError` or another form of exception during execution.
- If the issue has been fixed in a later version or the script is not replicating the issue accurately, it will print "Success, the issue did not occur."
