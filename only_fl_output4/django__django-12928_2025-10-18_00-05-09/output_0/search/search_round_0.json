It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

Each API call must have concrete arguments as inputs."

Looking for the main configuration or handling of the `TEMPLATES` setting which would likely be in the project setup or initialization code to understand if there's an infrastructure for handling `cache_templates` and `autoreload` options.\n2. Investigating the `cached template loader` implementation in Django to see how template loading and caching is currently implemented and consider where to implement the autoreload behavior.\n3. Checking if the fix mentioned for `#25788` is related and could provide a basis for implementing autoreload on the cached template loader.\n\nGiven the constraints, these are the API calls that make sense:\n\n- search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\"): DjangoTemplates is mentioned as the backend, so we need to understand how it is implemented.\n- search_code(\"cached template loader\"): To find the implementation or references of the cached template loader.\n- search_code(\"'cache_templates'\"): This will help us locate where the `cache_templates` option is being processed or if it's a newly proposed configuration that needs to be implemented.\n- search_code(\"'autoreload'\"): Similarly, this will aid in understanding how the `autoreload` option is currently managed in the codebase, especially in the context of templates.\n\nThese calls will provide a good starting point for gathering context on how templates are managed and cached, as well as how settings are applied, which are crucial for implementing the requested autoreload behavior for the cached template loader."
