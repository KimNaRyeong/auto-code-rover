        "intended_behavior": "The lambda function within the `where` function in `computation.py` file needs to be modified to prevent the `IndexError` by ensuring it only attempts to access the second item in `attrs` if it's guaranteed to exist. This can be achieved by checking the length of `attrs` before accessing its elements or by adapting the logic to handle single-item or empty `attrs` gracefully. A more robust handling might look like:\n\n```python\nif keep_attrs is True:\n    # Adjust the lambda to handle attrs with fewer than two items\n    keep_attrs = lambda attrs, context: attrs[1] if len(attrs) > 1 else attrs[0] if attrs else None\n```\n\nThis modification preserves the existing functionality of keeping attributes from the second parameter when they exist, while also safely handling cases where the assumption of having at least two attributes fails. The use of conditional expressions ensures backward compatibility and maintains the code's intent to preserve attributes according to the user's request with `keep_attrs=True`."
