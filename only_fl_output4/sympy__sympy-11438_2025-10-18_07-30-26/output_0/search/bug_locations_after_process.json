        "intended_behavior": "The function should include additional logic to verify if all even powers in the equation are equal. This update involves refining the logic around line 407, where it currently categorizes any equation with terms that have even powers and are greater than 3 into 'general_sum_of_even_powers'. The intended behavior should ensure that this classification only happens if all even-powered terms have the same power. If the powers are even but not the same, it should classify them differently or indicate that the current system cannot handle such cases, to avoid misdirecting the solving logic in `diophantine`. This refinement preserves the function's role in accurately classifying Diophantine equations, which is crucial for routing them to the appropriate solver."

However, if a new classification type for equations with variables raised to different even powers is introduced, `diophantine` may need to account for this new type and possibly handle it specifically, or at least fail gracefully by informing the user that such equations cannot be solved yet. The intended behavior here ensures that `diophantine` can either properly solve or accurately report the inability to solve equations based on their updated classification from `classify_diop`. This adjustment ensures the solver's response is both accurate and informative, aligning with the classifications provided by `classify_diop`."
