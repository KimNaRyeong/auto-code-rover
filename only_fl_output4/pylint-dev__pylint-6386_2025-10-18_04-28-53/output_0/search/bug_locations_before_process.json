The existing code likely needs to be adjusted to correctly register `-v` as a boolean flag or to handle it in a way that does not expect an additional value. This change preserves the behavior of enabling verbose output without altering the structural integrity or expected functionalities of the existing command-line option handling process."

        "intended_behavior": "Within this file, particularly around the `parse_args` method or where command-line arguments are defined, the code needs to be updated to ensure that `-v` or `--verbose` does not erroneously require an argument. The change should involve setting up the `-v` option correctly in the argument parsing setup so that it acts as a switch (on/off) instead of expecting a value. This update would align the short option's behavior with that of the long `--verbose` option, ensuring consistency and correcting the reported issue."
