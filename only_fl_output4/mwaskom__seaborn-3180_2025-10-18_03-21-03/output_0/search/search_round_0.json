        "content": "Based on the issue description, we need to gather more context from the `seaborn` codebase about how `relplot` and its related classes handle plotting, especially how it sets titles and formats for tick labels, and how it deals with axis sharing across facets, as the issue is related to overlapping labels when upgrading to seaborn version 0.12. The specific parts of interest from the issue include:\n\n1. The `relplot` function: to get an overview of how it's implemented and see if there were any changes in the latest version that could cause the issue.\n2. The configurations related to `facet_kws`, especially `sharex` and `sharey`, as they seem to be relevant to the problem.\n3. How titles are set in subplots (`set_titles` method) to investigate if any modifications lead to the positioning issues seen with the labels.\n4. How tick labels formatting (`ticklabel_format`) is applied across different versions.\n\nGiven this, our API calls would target these areas:\n\n1. **Search for the `relplot` function**: It's not necessarily a class, so we should start by searching where and how it's defined.\n2. **Search for code related to `facet_kws`**: Since `facet_kws` is not a method or class by itself but likely a parameter passed to some functions or classes, searching for code snippets that handle this parameter would be beneficial.\n3. **Search for the `set_titles` method**: This directly handles how titles are set on plots and could reveal changes affecting the layout.\n4. **Search for `ticklabel_format` usage**: Since overlapping labels could be related to how tick labels are formatted, seeing how this method is applied could provide insights.\n\nTherefore, the API calls for gathering this context would be:\n- `search_method(\"relplot\")`\n- `search_code(\"facet_kws\")`\n- `search_method(\"set_titles\")`\n- `search_code(\"ticklabel_format\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed to collect sufficient background to understand the cause of the issue."
