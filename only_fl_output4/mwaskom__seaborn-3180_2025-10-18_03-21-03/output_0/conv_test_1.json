First, it generates plots that should reveal the issue under certain conditions (specifically, when `sharex` and `sharey` are set to `False`). It utilizes an assumption-based approach to simulate detecting the issue by raising an `AssertionError` under those conditions. Due to the inherent complexity of automatically detecting visual issues like label overlaps in a static plot image, this script instead proposes manual inspection or suggests the possibility of implementing a more advanced image processing technique to automatically detect such visual discrepancies.\n\nUpon encountering an exception, which is presumed to represent the reproduction of the issue, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exits with status code 1, signaling the detection of the issue. Conversely, if no exceptions are raised (indicating the issue could not be reproduced under the tested conditions), it exits with status code 0, signaling that the issue was not detected. This behavior aligns with the task requirements to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed."
