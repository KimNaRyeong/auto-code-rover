        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we should focus on how grouping by a column with quantities is implemented in the `QTable` class of Astropy. Specifically, we need to understand how group keys are constructed and ensure they retain their quantity (i.e., value with units) instead of being reduced to mere floats. Relevant parts of the codebase would include the `QTable` class itself, any method responsible for grouping operations, and potentially, methods that handle extraction or representation of group keys. \n\nLet's proceed by searching for the relevant classes and methods:\n\n1. Search for the `QTable` class to understand its structure and related methods for grouping.\n2. Locate the method involved in grouping within the `QTable` class, which might be directly implemented or inherited from its parent classes.\n3. Investigate how keys are determined or extracted during the grouping process.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"QTable\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"group_by\", \"QTable\")\nsearch_method(\"group_keys\")\n```"
