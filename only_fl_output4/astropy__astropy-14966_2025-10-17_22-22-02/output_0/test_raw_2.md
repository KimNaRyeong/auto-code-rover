Understanding the need to correct and refine the reproduction of the issue as described, let's implement a version of `reproducer.py` that follows your instructions more closely. This script will focus on reproducing the issue where grouping keys in an `astropy.table.QTable` do not retain their unit information.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from astropy.table import QTable
        import astropy.units as u

        tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.,] * u.m})
        gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')
        
        for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
            key = dict(cols)
            if 'length' not in key or not isinstance(key['length'], u.Quantity):
                raise AssertionError("Group key 'length' is either missing or not a Quantity.")
            print(f"Checked key: {cols}, everything looks fine on the surface.")

        print("All keys checked. No issue detected with the visibility of units in the group keys.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is designed to:
- Reproduce the described issue by grouping a `QTable` on a column that has units, thus expecting the keys to retain units.
- Specifically check if the group keys (`gtbl.groups.keys`) retain their quantity nature (both value and unit) as they should.
- If the group keys do not retain the unit, an `AssertionError` is raised indicating the failure to maintain the expected behavior.
- Utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to provide detailed traceback information if exceptions occur during execution, aiding in debugging.
- It aims to exit with code `0` when no issue is detected (all assertions pass without raising an error), indicating that the behavior is as expected. Conversely, it exits with code `1` upon encountering an exception, providing a clear indication of failure to reproduce the intended behavior correctly.
