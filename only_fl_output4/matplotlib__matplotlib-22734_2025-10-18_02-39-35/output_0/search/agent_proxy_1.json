This method currently parses and uses these parameters to scale the color normalization through the `_scale_norm` method. The bug fix should ensure that the values provided by `vmin` and `vmax` (if specified by the user) are properly used to adjust the color scale to accurately reflect this range in the plot. This entails double-checking the logic that leads to the call of `_scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)` to make sure it doesn't ignore or misinterpret `vmin` and `vmax` parameters. The expected behavior here is that when `vmin` and `vmax` are provided (either directly or as part of `clim`), these values should explicitly limit the color range of the plot as specified, preserving all other functionalities of the method.\n\nThis resolution aims at making `tripcolor` respect the input `clim` parameters, adjusting the plot's color scaling accordingly without altering any unrelated functionality of the method or affecting how other parameters are handled."
