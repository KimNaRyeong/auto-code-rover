        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to the `quantile` method and its handling of percentiles in xarray, we should focus on finding where the `quantile` method is implemented within the xarray library. Since the issue mentions that xarray wraps `np.nanpercentile` and expects quantiles in the range `[0, 1]` but throws an error message indicating a range of `[0, 100]`, we need to locate the implementation of the `quantile` function that generates this incorrect error message. It seems pertinent to search for the `quantile` method in xarray's source code, as well as the places where `np.nanpercentile` is being used within that context.\n\nHence, the appropriate API calls to make in this situation would likely include:\n\n1. Searching for the `quantile` method across the entire codebase to find its definition(s).\n2. Searching for the code snippets that mention or utilize `np.nanpercentile` to understand how it is integrated within the `quantile` implementation.\n\nThus, the calls would be:\n\n- `search_method(\"quantile\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.nanpercentile\")`"
