Given the context and the need for a revised approach to better align with the original intent and conditions, here is an adjusted `reproducer.py` Python script. This script is designed to specifically address the reported issue within the xarray library regarding quantile percentile input validation and error messaging. 

This script will attempt to replicate the issue described, checking if an appropriate exception with the correct error message is raised when a percentile value outside of the expected range `[0, 1]` is input. The error message reported in the issue (`"ValueError: Percentiles must be in the range [0, 100]"`) is incorrect based on xarray's expected quantile value range, and thus we're aiming to trigger and catch the correct ValueError, validating its message against the expected `"Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]"`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_xarray_quantile_error_message():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])
        # Attempting to trigger the error with an incorrect quantile value
        da.quantile(q=1.5)  # Should raise ValueError due to input value being outside [0, 1] range
    except ValueError as e:
        assert "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]" in str(e), "Incorrect error message"
        print("Test passed: Correct exception message received.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 for passing the test
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for an unexpected error

    print("Test failed: No exception was raised by xarray.DataArray.quantile with incorrect quantile value.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for failing the test due to not raising the expected error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_xarray_quantile_error_message()
```

This script ensures a clear structure for validating the specific issue presence or absence by executing a piece of code that should provoke the expected `ValueError`. It checks the error message for compliance with expectations based on the reported xarray behavior, using an assertion to confirm the message accuracy. If the issue persists (i.e., a different error message is shown or no error is triggered when it should be), this script will help in catching that and exiting with an appropriate status code to indicate failure. On the flip side, if the expected error message is correctly displayed, the script exits with code 0, indicating the absence of the reported issue or that the issue has been fixed.
