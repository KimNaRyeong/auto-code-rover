It should ensure that when considering what the next migration number should be, it fully accounts for all existing migrations, including those that may have been squashed into a single file. The enhancement would likely involve adjusting the logic that tracks and identifies the highest current migration number, ensuring that it does not simply increment from the highest standalone migration but also considers the endpoint of squashed migrations."

        "intended_behavior": "The adjustments needed aren't tied to a specific method discovered in our searches, suggesting the logic that determines new migration numbers is distributed or abstracted away from a single point in the code. Ideally, the process leading up to invoking `MigrationWriter` to create a new migration file should be scrutinized to ensure it accurately considers the entirety of migration history, including squashed migrations. This might involve augmenting the methodology to assess current migrations, possibly involving adjustments or enhancements in several areas including the initial gathering of migration states, processing of the migration graph to consider squashed migrations, and the final decision logic for numbering new migrations."
