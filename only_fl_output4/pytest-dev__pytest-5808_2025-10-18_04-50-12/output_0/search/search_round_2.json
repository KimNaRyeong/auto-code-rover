The code structure or file names have changed, introducing different locations or mechanisms for the `--pastebin` feature.  \n2. The issue description might contain outdated links or file paths, making it necessary to search more broadly.  \n3. The feature's implementation could have been refactored or renamed, requiring a broader scope of search.  \n\n### New Approach  \n\nGiven this situation, a revised strategy involves conducting a broader search to locate where the `--pastebin` feature is implemented or any associated mechanics like sending HTTP requests are handled. Here are the next steps:\n\n1. **Search for mentions of the `--pastebin` feature:** This might uncover command line argument parsing or the feature's triggering logic, not just the submission logic.\n   - `search_code(\"--pastebin\")`\n\n2. **Broaden the search for the HTTP request submission logic:** Given that the issue involves an HTTP request to `bpaste.net`, searching for the host or submission logic might capture relevant code segments.\n   - `search_code(\"bpaste.net\")`\n   - `search_code(\"urlopen\")`\n\n3. **Investigate related functions or classes:** If `Pastebin` isn't found, there might be related classes or functions managing the pastebin functionality or external submissions.\n   - `search_method(\"create_new_paste\")`\n   - `search_method(\"submit_to_pastebin\")`\n\n### Intended Outcomes  \n\n- **Identification of the `--pastebin` implementation:** To see how pytest processes this option and initiates an HTTP request.\n- **Locating the HTTP request logic:** Understanding how data is prepared and submitted to `bpaste.net`, including the choice of `lexer`.\n- **Finding alternatives to `lexer=python3`:** With the direct reference missing, any related logic might reveal how and where to change `lexer=python3` to `lexer=text`. \n\n### Necessary API Calls  \n1. `search_code(\"--pastebin\")`\n2. `search_code(\"bpaste.net\")`\n3. `search_code(\"urlopen\")`\n4. `search_method(\"create_new_paste\")`\n5. `search_method(\"submit_to_pastebin\")`\n\nThis revised approach aims to gather contextual information surrounding the issue for a more informed resolution path."
