The results indicate that both `testing/test_pastebin.py` and `src/_pytest/pastebin.py` are crucial files in understanding and addressing the issue at hand.\n\n### Analyzing Collected Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `testing/test_pastebin.py` likely contains tests for the `--pastebin` feature, verifying its functionality and possibly the interaction with `bpaste.net`.\n   - `src/_pytest/pastebin.py` is expected to contain the implementation of the `--pastebin` feature, including constructing and sending requests to `bpaste.net`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue is specifically related to how pytest uses the `--pastebin` feature to submit output to `bpaste.net`, where using `lexer=python3` causes HTTP 400 errors for certain contents. Since `src/_pytest/pastebin.py` includes the implementation, this file is likely where the problematic parameter setting occurs. Tests in `testing/test_pastebin.py` might be reflecting either the testing of this functionality or the assumptions about how the output should be submitted.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to modify the `--pastebin` feature's implementation in `src/_pytest/pastebin.py` so that it uses `lexer=text` instead of `lexer=python3` when constructing the request to `bpaste.net`. This adjustment will allow for the correct handling of the pytest output as arbitrary text rather than Python code, which aligns with the suggestion from the issue description. This change aims to ensure that all content submitted through this feature is accepted by `bpaste.net` without resulting in HTTP 400 errors.\n\nGiven the collected context and analysis, the next steps will involve directly examining the code within `src/_pytest/pastebin.py` to locate the exact lines where the `lexer=python3` parameter is set for the `--pastebin` functionality and to prepare a patch that changes this parameter to `lexer=text`. This modification will need to preserve the rest of the pastebin functionality as it currently exists, ensuring that the only change is related to the handling of this specific parameter."

The correct course of action is to find the portion of code that specifies `lexer=python3` for these requests and change it to `lexer=text`. This update should ensure that pytest's output is interpreted by `bpaste.net` as plain text, which should, in turn, eliminate the \"HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\" issues. The intended behavior is to preserve the overall functionality of submitting test output to `bpaste.net`, with the only modification being the type of content (`lexer`) that is being submitted. This adjustment should not affect any other aspects of the feature, ensuring that users can still use the `--pastebin` option without encountering HTTP errors for certain contents.\n\nGiven the targeted nature of this fix, no other files or methods should need modifications to address the reported issue directly.
