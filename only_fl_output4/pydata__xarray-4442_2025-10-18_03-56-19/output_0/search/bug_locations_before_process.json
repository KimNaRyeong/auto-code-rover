        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to properly handle the conversion of a DataArray with both a MultiIndex and other separate dimensions into a pandas.Series. When encountering a DataArray with a mixed index (MultiIndex and regular dimensions), the method should generate a combined MultiIndex that accurately represents the hierarchy and structure of all dimensions in the resulting pandas.Series. This entails ensuring that all dimensions, whether part of the MultiIndex or not, are reflected in the index of the series, possibly by extending the MultiIndex or by better handling the reshaping and indexing logic to account for the complexity of the data structure."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to to_series, to_dataframe needs adjustment to adeptly transform a DataArray with a combination of a MultiIndex and other dimensions into a pandas.DataFrame. This includes ensuring that the DataFrame correctly reflects all dimensions present in the DataArray, represented either through a MultiIndex for rows or through separate columns, as appropriate. This might require modifying the logic that translates the DataArray structure into the DataFrame to ensure that additional dimensions beyond those in the MultiIndex are handled correctly, ensuring that the structure of the data is maintained in tabular form."
