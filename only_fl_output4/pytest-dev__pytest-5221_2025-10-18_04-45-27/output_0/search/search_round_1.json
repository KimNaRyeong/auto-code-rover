        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have several pieces of information related to how pytest handles fixtures, especially regarding the `--fixtures` option and the infrastructure around reporting and displaying fixtures.\n\n### Analysis of `pytest_addoption`\n\nThe `pytest_addoption` method is found in many files within pytest's codebase. This method is typically used to add command-line options to the pytest configuration. Given the widespread presence of this method, it's clear that pytest utilizes a decentralized approach to defining command-line options, enabling plugins and different components to independently introduce their settings. \n\nFor the issue at hand, the `pytest_addoption` method likely introduces or deals with the `--fixtures` command-line option in one of the relevant files, probably `src/_pytest/python.py` or `src/_pytest/terminal.py`, as these files are more directly related to pytest's fixtures and terminal output, respectively.\n\n### Analysis of `show_fixtures_per_test` and `showfixtures`\n\nThe `show_fixtures_per_test` and `showfixtures` methods are both located in `src/_pytest/python.py`, which suggests this file plays a significant role in managing fixtures, including gathering and displaying them. The presence of these methods indicates that pytest has a mechanism for showing fixtures, possibly tied to the `--fixtures` option or similar functionality. The specific method `showfixtures` seems directly related to displaying fixtures, which is the primary concern of the issue at hand. Understanding how these methods work\u2014and how they produce output\u2014would be crucial in addressing the issue.\n\n### Missing `report_header` Method\n\nThe fact that no method named `report_header` was found implies either a misunderstanding of the codebase's structure or that such functionality is integrated within other methods or under a different name. The search for `def pytest_report_header` yielded results, indicating that reporting headers, including possibly fixtures information, is an extendable part of pytest functionality, likely customizable via hooks or similar mechanisms.\n\n### `def pytest_report_header`\n\nThe findings related to `def pytest_report_header` in various files suggest that pytest allows custom headers to be defined for the test reports. This mechanism could potentially be used or extended to include fixture scope information as part of the output when the `--fixtures` option is used. It demonstrates the extensibility of pytest's reporting features, which might be leveraged to solve the issue.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- The functionality related to displaying fixtures is centralized in `src/_pytest/python.py`, making it a key target for modification to include fixture scope in the output.\n- The absence of direct hits for `report_header` suggests that output related to fixtures is handled through other mechanisms or specific methods like `showfixtures`.\n- The `pytest_report_header` functionality shows that pytest's reporting mechanisms are extensible, which could be useful in including additional information about fixtures.\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would involve modifying either the `showfixtures` method or how pytest handles option reporting to include the scope of fixtures in the output.\n\nTo further this analysis and move towards a solution, examining the codes of `showfixtures`, `show_fixtures_per_test`, and where `pytest_addoption` in `src/_pytest/python.py` or `src/_pytest/terminal.py` handles the `--fixtures` option would be the next logical steps. Understanding how these components currently work will provide insight into how to seamlessly integrate fixture scope information into the output."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Currently, this method likely gathers and displays the available fixtures without scope information. The modification should ensure that for each fixture displayed, its scope (function, class, module, package, or session) is also listed next to it. This change should augment the existing functionality without altering the original purpose of the method, ensuring it continues to display all available fixtures accurately but with the added context of their scope.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - File: src/_pytest/python.py\n   - Method: show_fixtures_per_test\n   - Intended Behavior: While `show_fixtures_per_test` might not directly contribute to the listing of fixtures invoked by the `--fixtures` command, ensuring consistency in fixture-related outputs across pytest might be beneficial. If this method is involved in displaying fixtures in any context (e.g., when showing fixtures per test), it should also be updated to include fixture scope information. This would ensure a uniform experience and understanding of fixture scope across different usages within pytest.\n\nBy addressing these locations, the enhancement requested in the issue can be implemented, providing users with the ability to see fixture scopes directly through the pytest CLI when using the `--fixtures` option, thereby improving developer experience and debugging efficiency."
