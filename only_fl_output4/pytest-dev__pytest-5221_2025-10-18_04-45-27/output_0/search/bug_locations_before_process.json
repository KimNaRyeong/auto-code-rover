Currently, this method likely gathers and displays the available fixtures without scope information. The modification should ensure that for each fixture displayed, its scope (function, class, module, package, or session) is also listed next to it. This change should augment the existing functionality without altering the original purpose of the method, ensuring it continues to display all available fixtures accurately but with the added context of their scope."

        "intended_behavior": "While `show_fixtures_per_test` might not directly contribute to the listing of fixtures invoked by the `--fixtures` command, ensuring consistency in fixture-related outputs across pytest might be beneficial. If this method is involved in displaying fixtures in any context (e.g., when showing fixtures per test), it should also be updated to include fixture scope information. This would ensure a uniform experience and understanding of fixture scope across different usages within pytest."
