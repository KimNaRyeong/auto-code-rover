Given the issue's mention of an empirical cdf not being the method of mapping to a uniform distribution, it would also be useful to look into the method by which the transformation is actually accomplished.\n\nTherefore, I will execute the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"QuantileTransformer\")` - This call is aimed at locating the file or files where the `QuantileTransformer` class is defined. This will give a starting point to look into the implementation details.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"QuantileTransformer\")` - Since the fitting process might involve the computation that transforms the data distribution, searching for the `fit` method in the `QuantileTransformer` class could provide insights into the implementation details.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"QuantileTransformer\")` - Similar to the `fit` method, the `transform` method is likely where the actual data transformation happens, which might reveal the technique used to map data to a uniform distribution or any other distribution.\n\n4. `search_code(\"empirical cdf\")` - Because the issue mentions an expectation around computing the empirical cumulative distribution function (cdf), searching for this term might help find related discussions or implementations, even if they are not directly used by the `QuantileTransformer`. This would give context on alternatives considered or why a different approach was chosen."
