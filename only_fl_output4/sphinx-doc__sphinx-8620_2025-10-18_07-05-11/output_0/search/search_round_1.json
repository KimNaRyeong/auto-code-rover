If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

The comment indicates that this class is responsible for transforming the `:kbd:` role into a more detailed form.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nBased on its placement within `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py`, the `KeyboardTransform` class seems to handle the transformation of textual representations of keyboard keys (specified with the `:kbd:` role in reStructuredText documents) into their HTML representation. The class name and its description suggest it is a post-transform process that takes place during the generation of HTML output from the source documents.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThis class is likely where the HTML for the `:kbd:` role is generated. Given the issue's description, the current implementation does not differentiate between standalone key presentations and compound keys in terms of CSS classes. Hence, this class or its methods are direct contributors to the behavior described as problematic in the bug report.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior we'd like to achieve is for the `KeyboardTransform` class to insert an additional CSS class into the `<kbd>` elements acting as containers for compound keystrokes. This modification will allow for differential styling between single keystrokes and compound keystrokes, addressing the issue raised.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven this analysis, we need to examine the `KeyboardTransform` class more closely to understand its implementation specifics. It's crucial to identify how it currently processes the `:kbd:` role and generates HTML elements, and how we might modify this process to include the desired CSS class on compound keystrokes.\n\nThe following API calls seem appropriate to gather the necessary details for implementing a patch:\n\n- `search_class(\"KeyboardTransform\")`: This will provide an overview of the class and help in understanding its structure and any potentially relevant methods that handle the transformation.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py\", 22, 10)`: Since we know the class starts at line 22, getting the code around this line will give us a headstart on understanding the implementation specifics of the `KeyboardTransform` class.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a detailed look into the `KeyboardTransform` class to facilitate the creation of a patch for the issue."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Location:**\n   - **File:** `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py`\n   - **Class:** `KeyboardTransform`\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThe behavior of the `KeyboardTransform` class needs to be modified to distinguish between single keystroke `<kbd>` elements and container `<kbd>` elements for compound keystrokes. This can be achieved by implementing the following logic within the class's methods responsible for generating `<kbd>` HTML elements:\n\n- **For single keystrokes** (currently represented correctly): No change is needed. The existing functionality, which assigns the class `kbd docutils literal notranslate` to `<kbd>` elements should be preserved.\n  \n- **For compound keystrokes**: Modify the generation of the container `<kbd>` element to include an additional CSS class, such as `compound`. The resulting HTML should look like this for compound keystrokes:\n  ```html\n  <kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n  </kbd>\n  ```\n  This distinguishes the container `<kbd>` elements from their child keystroke `<kbd>` elements, thus allowing for differential styling via CSS. The existing functionality for the child elements remains unchanged.\n\nThe **modification** requires examining and adjusting the method(s) within `KeyboardTransform` class that are responsible for generating the `<kbd>` HTML elements. The goal is to implement a conditional logic where, if a `<kbd>` element represents a compound keystroke (i.e., it wraps other `<kbd>` elements), an additional CSS class (`compound`) is added to it. This change ensures the structure and styling potential described in the issue is achieved without affecting the current presentation for single keystrokes."
