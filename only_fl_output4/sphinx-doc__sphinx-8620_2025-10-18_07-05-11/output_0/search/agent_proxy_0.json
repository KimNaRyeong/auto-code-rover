The goal is to add a distinct CSS class to the container `<kbd>` elements for compound keystrokes. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the role handler**: Since the issue is with the `:kbd:` role, it's likely handled by a specific Sphinx domain or a general role processing mechanism in Sphinx. We can start by searching for the method or code snippet related to processing this role. \n   - `search_code(\":kbd:\")`\n\n2. **Search for HTML generation**: The generation of HTML from roles likely happens in a method dedicated to rendering or transforming the roles into HTML. \n   - `search_code(\"<kbd\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to find where the `:kbd:` role is defined and handled, and where the HTML output for roles is generated, which will give us the necessary context to plan a patch."
