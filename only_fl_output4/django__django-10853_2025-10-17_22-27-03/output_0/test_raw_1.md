Based on your instructions, here's an adjusted script for `reproducer.py` which aims to accurately reflect the original error and align with your requirements. The error in understanding seems to be regarding the outcome when the issue is encountered. This script will specifically check for the presence of the SQLite version and attempt to use window functions. If window functions raise an OperationalError due to being unsupported in the SQLite version in use, the script will catch this and behave as specified. 

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_sqlite_version():
    import sqlite3
    # Extract the SQLite version
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute('select sqlite_version();')
    version_tuple = tuple(int(x) for x in cur.fetchone()[0].split('.'))
    conn.close()
    return version_tuple

def test_sqlite_window_function():
    import sqlite3
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
        c = conn.cursor()
        c.execute("CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)")
        c.execute("INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')")
        # This statement is expected to raise an OperationalError if window functions are not supported
        c.execute("SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x")
        # If no error was raised until now, it means window functions are supported
    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sqlite_version = check_sqlite_version()
        if sqlite_version < (3, 25, 0):
            # Raises an AssertionError if the SQLite version is older than 3.25.0 and window function issues are detected
            raise AssertionError("SQLite version does not support window functions. Detected version: " + '.'.join(map(str, sqlite_version)))
        else:
            # If the error is not related to window function support due to SQLite version, re-raise the original error
            raise
    finally:
        conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sqlite_window_function()
        print("No issue detected. Window functions are supported in this version of SQLite.")
    except AssertionError as error_message:
        print(error_message)
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 when the expected AssertionError is caught indicating the issue is correctly reproduced.
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle other unexpected exceptions
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate an unexpected failure scenario.
```

This version of the script starts by checking the SQLite version it is running with to determine if the version supports window functions or not. If the test for window functions raises an `OperationalError`, and the SQLite version is lower than 3.25.0, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating that window functions are not supported by the current SQLite version. This matches your requirement of raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and also exits with code 0 when the specific case of missing window function support due to an older SQLite version is detected.
