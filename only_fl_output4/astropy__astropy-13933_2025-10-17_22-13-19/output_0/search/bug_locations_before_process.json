        "intended_behavior": "The `to_string` method should correctly interpret and convert the unit of an `Angle` object into a string representation, regardless of the object being pickled and unpickled. To resolve the issue, the method must ensure that the unit (whether `hourangle`, `degree`, or any other angular unit) retains its full functionality and identification for sexagesimal notation conversion post-deserialization. This might involve either fixing how units are restored during the unpickling process or adding a verification step within `to_string` to correctly re-interpret or set the unit based on the angle's value if it's found to be compromised after unpickling. This fix should preserve the existing functionality, allowing for both decimal and sexagesimal representations with various formatting options, without introducing regressions for non-pickled `Angle` objects."
