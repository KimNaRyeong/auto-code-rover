This is where the error is presumably arising after pickling and unpickling the object.\n\n3. `search_code(\"pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(\")`: Although this is a generic Python operation, finding how and where it's used in the context of the `Angle` object or similar objects might highlight serialization or deserialization patterns that could be affecting this specific case."
