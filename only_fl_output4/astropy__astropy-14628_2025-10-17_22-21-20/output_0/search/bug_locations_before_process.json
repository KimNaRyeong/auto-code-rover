        "intended_behavior": "The `get_itrs` method should be enhanced to accept an additional optional parameter named `location` that defaults to `None`. If `location` is provided, the method computes the ITRS position relative to this `location` instead of the default geocentric position. This `location` should be another `EarthLocation` instance, allowing the computation of a topocentric position relative to it. When `location` is `None`, the method should retain its current behavior for backward compatibility. This implies:\n- Adding logic to handle the subtraction of the `location` coordinates from the instance's coordinates when `location` is not `None`, before creating the `ITRS` object.\n- The method's documentation should be updated to describe the new `location` parameter and its usage.\n- Incorporating checks and potential coordinate transformations if needed to ensure the `location` argument is correctly used for the calculation.\n- Defaulting to `EARTH_CENTER` if `location` is not provided requires understanding `EARTH_CENTER`'s current usage within the project and ensuring the proposed functionality aligns with these conventions."
