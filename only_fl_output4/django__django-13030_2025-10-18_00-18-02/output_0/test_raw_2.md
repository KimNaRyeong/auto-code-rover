To create a standalone Python script that can reproduce the initially described issue, we need to ensure that the script does not attempt operations that may lead to foreign key constraint violations and correctly captures the intent of detecting `NULL` values passed to `IN` lookup in a Django ORM query. The objective here is to check the SQL query generated by `prefetch_related` for the presence of `IN (NULL,..)` or similar, which indicates the issue persists if found.

This script executes within a minimal Django environment. It sets up a basic testing scenario by defining two models and executing queries that should lead to the reproduction of the issue if it exists. The script specifically looks for generated SQL queries that include `IN (NULL,...)` after executing a `prefetch_related` call, which is where the issue was described to manifest. If the undesired behavior is detected, the script raises an `AssertionError` and provides a stack trace for debugging. Conversely, if no issue is detected (i.e., no `IN (NULL,...)` is found in the queries), the script exits normally and indicates no issue was found, aligning with the specified requirements.
