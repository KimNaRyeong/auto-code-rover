Given the updated directive and to directly address the specified desire for triggering an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, let's construct an improved version of the `reproducer.py`. This version will more explicitly check for the undesired behavior and assert conditions that indicate the issue's presence. Given the nature of the problem around Django's handling of `NULL` values in `IN` clauses, the script will directly check for the presence of a `NULL` in the generated SQL query of a `prefetch_related` operation, and ensure the environment is isolated for the test.

            raise AssertionError("The issue is present: NULL found in IN clause.")

```

This script, when run, should accurately catch and assert the issue with `NULL` being passed to an `IN` lookup within Django's ORM operations related to `prefetch_related` queries. If the undesired behavior is found, it will print a detailed stack trace, helping in the isolation and description of the problem. Conversely, if the behavior is not observed (implying a potential fix or nonoccurrence of the issue), it confirms the lack of detected issues and exits gracefully with code 0.
