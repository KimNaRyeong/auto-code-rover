Given the context shared and your request to replicate the previously attempted test script, it seems you're asking for a refined approach that directly targets the issue described without running into the setup problem indicated by the error logs. The ImportError related to `sklearn.__check_build._check_build` suggests a problem with the sklearn installation rather than the script itself. However, I'll provide an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py` script to specifically focus on reproducing the given sklearn issue.

Please ensure that your sklearn installation is correct and complete before running the script. If you're working with a source installation, follow the advice given in the error message to build sklearn properly. For a standard installation, using pip (`pip install scikit-learn`) or conda (`conda install scikit-learn`) should avoid such issues.

Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue described. Note that this script is structured to emphasize the problem outlined regarding `_BaseComposition._set_params` with no estimators:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_set_params_with_no_estimators():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # This line is expected to raise a ValueError due to the issue being present
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert str(e) == "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)", "Unexpected error message"
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected exception type was raised"
    else:
        # If no error, the issue might have been fixed.
        print("No exception was raised. The issue might have been fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_set_params_with_no_estimators()
    print("Test executed successfully.")
```

This script now includes a more detailed catch for `ValueError` specific to the issue at hand and will assert an unexpected error if another type of exception is caught. It also resolves directly after the test case without explicitly setting an exit code unless an AssertionError is raised, which simplifies the script's flow.

Please ensure your sklearn library is correctly installed and operational before running this script. If you encounter any installation-related errors, it would be advisable to resolve those first by either reinstalling sklearn or ensuring your development environment is correctly set up.
