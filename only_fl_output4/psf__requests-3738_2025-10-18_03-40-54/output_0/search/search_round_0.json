This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to explore the places in the codebase where URLs are processed, especially with regard to different schemes and the addition of parameters. Since the issue mentions problems with handling parameters for URLs with unrecognized schemes and has a hint towards a potential solution involving session objects, let's focus on the following areas:\n\n1. Look for the `Session` class, as it might be involved in handling URLs or might need modifications to introduce a registry for URL preparation based on scheme.\n2. Search for methods related to URL preparation or parameter handling within or related to the `Session` class or elsewhere if applicable.\n3. Since the issue mentions a change that occurred in version 2.12.2 that caused the bug, finding methods that have changed around parameter handling for URLs with non-standard schemes since that version could be beneficial.\n4. Find where in the code URLs are being parsed or prepared, especially looking for methods that might explicitly ignore non-`http` schemes.\n\nTo this end, I will start with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Session\")` - To find the file and location of the Session class.\n2. `search_method(\"prepare_request\")` - This method sounds like it could be involved in preparing requests, which may include handling URL parameters.\n3. `search_code(\"parse_url\")` - Assuming there might be a method or function involved in parsing URLs that could be handling or mishandling non-`http` schemes."
