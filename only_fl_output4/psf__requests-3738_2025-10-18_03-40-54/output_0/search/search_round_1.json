This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme.

Look for the `Session` class, as it might be involved in handling URLs or might need modifications to introduce a registry for URL preparation based on scheme.\n2. Search for methods related to URL preparation or parameter handling within or related to the `Session` class or elsewhere if applicable.\n3.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into how the `requests` library handles URL preparation and parameter merging, which are central to the reported issue. Let\u2019s break down the analysis based on the results:\n\n### 1. `Session` Class in `requests/sessions.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `Session` class manages the state across multiple requests\u2014headers, cookies, proxies, and more. Within this class, `prepare_request` is notably responsible for constructing a `PreparedRequest` object, which aggregates the settings and parameters from both the individual request and the session context itself.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe issue arises from the handling of URLs with schemes that the `requests` library does not recognize. Given that `prepare_request` is the method where URLs, alongside other parameters, are prepared for transmission, it's plausible that this method indirectly contributes to the bug. Parameters should be appended to URLs regardless of the scheme, but apparently, this does not happen for unfamiliar schemes.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, the `prepare_request` method should allow parameters to be added to URLs with non-standard schemes, assuming they follow a similar syntactic pattern to standard HTTP/HTTPS schemes. This could involve adjusting how URL schemes are validated or handled within the session's request preparation process.\n\n### 2. `prepare_request` Method in `requests/sessions.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis method performs the actual construction of the `PreparedRequest` object, incorporating cookies, headers, parameters, and authentication credentials. It ensures that the outgoing request integrates both specific request-level options and those set at the session level, enabling consistent request behavior.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nSince this method prepares the request, including URL parameters merging (`params=merge_setting(request.params, self.params)`), its functioning is directly related to the issue. If the method or its helpers exclude non-HTTP schemes from parameter addition or treat them differently, it could lead to the described bug.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n`prepare_request` should treat URLs with unrecognized schemes similarly to recognized ones, in terms of parameter addition. If there's any filtering or exclusion logic based on URL schemes, it might need revisiting to accommodate or specially handle non-standard, yet HTTP-like, schemes (`http+unix`, etc.).\n\n### 3. Usage of `parse_url` in the Codebase\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThough not directly inspected in detail, the presence of `parse_url` across multiple files (especially in `models.py` and utilities within `urllib3`) suggests it's used for URL parsing and preparation. Functions and methods that parse URLs are critical for dissecting the URL into its components, including the scheme, which is at the heart of the issue.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nWhile the exact behavior of `parse_url` was not detailed, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that how URLs are parsed\u2014including how schemes are recognized and handled\u2014would impact whether parameters get properly appended to URLs. Incorrect parsing or handling might lead to parameters being dropped for schemes not recognized as HTTP-compatible.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe parsing function should accurately break down URLs of varying schemes without prejudice, ensuring that subsequent steps which depend on parsed URL components (like parameter merging) can operate without issue, even for non-standard but legitimate schemes.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, it would be pertinent to delve further into:\n- How `prepare_request` and related utilities treat URL schemes during the request preparation phase.\n- Specific logic within `parse_url` functions related to scheme handling, to ensure non-standard schemes are not inadvertently discarded or mishandled during the URL preparation process.\n\nThis detailed analysis lays the groundwork for identifying where adjustments are necessary to resolve the issue while maintaining the intended security posture and functionality of the `requests` library."

This involves ensuring that the method (and any utility function it calls for URL manipulation) does not exclude non-HTTP schemes from processing. Specifically, the merging of parameters (`params=merge_setting(request.params, self.params)`) should apply uniformly across all URL schemes. The method should either include a check to allow certain non-standard, yet HTTP-like schemes, or implement a more robust scheme recognition process that can be customized or extended through a registry mechanism as suggested in the issue. This approach allows `http+unix` and similar schemes to be treated with HTTP-like parameter processing, without compromising the security considerations of excluding unknown schemes by default.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `requests/models.py` and potentially `requests/packages/urllib3/util/url.py`\n  \n  **Intended Behavior**: While exact methods within these files were not pinpointed from the context gathered, modifications in these files should aim to ensure the parsing of URLs (`parse_url` or related methods) accurately retains and processes the query parameters even for non-standard schemes. This might involve refining how URL components are extracted and how schemes influence the handling of the rest of the URL. For `parse_url` and any method that plays a role in identifying and working with URL schemes, ensure they facilitate appending parameters to or retaining them for unfamiliar schemes. If `parse_url` is found to improperly handle or recognize non-standard schemes, its logic should be adjusted to parse such URLs accurately, enabling downstream processing (such as parameter merging) to function correctly.\n\nBy addressing these locations and ensuring the intended behavior is met, the issue with parameters not being added to URLs with unrecognized schemes will be resolved, thus supporting a wider range of URL schemes while maintaining the intended functionality of the existing code."
