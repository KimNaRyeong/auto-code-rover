        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the `where` keyword argument not being supported for `astropy.units.Quantity` instances when using `np.mean`, we need to look into several parts of both the Astropy and NumPy projects. Specifically, we need to understand how `astropy.units.Quantity` integrates with NumPy functions, including any special handling or overrides for NumPy operations. Here are the relevant API calls to make:\n\n1. To understand any existing integration or overrides that `astropy.units.Quantity` may have with NumPy functions, we should first locate the `Quantity` class in the Astropy codebase.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Quantity\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the `where` keyword not being supported by `np.mean` when used with `astropy.units.Quantity`, it's also relevant to check if `Quantity` has any custom implementation or overrides for mean or any NumPy aggregating functions that might be affecting this.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"mean\", \"Quantity\")\n   ```\n\n3. To see if there's any handling or compatibility layer specifically for dealing with NumPy's `where` argument in any part of the Astropy codebase, we should look for any code snippets that reference this keyword.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"where\")\n   ```\n\n4. Given that the issue may stem from how `astropy.units.Quantity` instances are processed by NumPy functions like `np.mean`, it might be useful to check if there are any utility functions or methods in Astropy that deal with making `Quantity` instances compatible with NumPy operations.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"quantity_to_numpy\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to locate relevant parts of the Astropy codebase where modifications could be implemented to add support for the `where` keyword in NumPy functions when used with `astropy.units.Quantity`."
