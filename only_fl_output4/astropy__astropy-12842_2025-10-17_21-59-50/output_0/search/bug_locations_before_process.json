        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location should allow for a more flexible handling of datatypes not originally included in ECSV_DATATYPES, specifically datetime64. Instead of outright raising a ValueError when encountering an unsupported datatype, the method should better accommodate such scenarios. One approach could be to formally include datetime64 in the list of supported ECSV_DATATYPES. Alternatively, if extending the standard is not desirable, the method could be adjusted to convert datetime64 data into a supported format internally, ensuring compatibility while also issuing a warning that transformation has occurred to maintain data integrity. This would prevent the ValueError and allow users to read ECSV files created with older versions of Astropy without manual data manipulation, thus preserving the functionality of reading and processing ECSV files seamlessly across different Astropy versions."
