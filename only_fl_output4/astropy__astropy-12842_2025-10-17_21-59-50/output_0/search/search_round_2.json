        "content": "<issue>No longer able to read BinnedTimeSeries with datetime column saved as ECSV after upgrading from 4.2.1 -> 5.0+\n### Description\nHi, [This commit](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/e807dbff9a5c72bdc42d18c7d6712aae69a0bddc) merged in PR #11569 breaks my ability to read an ECSV file created using Astropy v 4.2.1, BinnedTimeSeries class's write method, which has a datetime64 column. Downgrading astropy back to 4.2.1 fixes the issue because the strict type checking in line 177 of ecsv.py is not there.\nIs there a reason why this strict type checking was added to ECSV? Is there a way to preserve reading and writing of ECSV files created with BinnedTimeSeries across versions? I am happy to make a PR on this if the strict type checking is allowed to be scaled back or we can add datetime64 as an allowed type.\n### Expected behavior\nThe file is read into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object from ecsv file without error.\n### Actual behavior\nValueError is produced and the file is not read because ECSV.py does not accept the datetime64 column.\n`ValueError: datatype 'datetime64' of column 'time_bin_start' is not in allowed values ('bool', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64', 'float128', 'string')`\n### Steps to Reproduce\nThe file is read using:\n`BinnedTimeSeries.read('<file_path>', format='ascii.ecsv')`\nwhich gives a long error.\nThe file in question is a binned time series created by  `astropy.timeseries.aggregate_downsample`. which itself is a binned version of an `astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries` instance with some TESS data. (loaded via TimeSeries.from_pandas(Tess.set_index('datetime')). I.e., it has a datetime64 index.  The file was written using the classes own .write method in Astropy V4.2.1 from an instance of said class:\n`myBinnedTimeSeries.write('<file_path>',format='ascii.ecsv',overwrite=True)`\nI'll attach a concatenated version of the file (as it contains private data). However, the relevant part from the header is on line 4:\n```\n# %ECSV 0.9\n# ---\n# datatype:\n# - {name: time_bin_start, datatype: datetime64}\n```\nas you can see, the datatype is datetime64. This works fine with ECSV V0.9 but not V1.0 as some sort of strict type checking was added.\n###\nFull error log:\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [3], in <module>\n---> 49 tsrbin = BinnedTimeSeries.read('../Photometry/tsr_bin.dat', format='ascii.ecsv')\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/timeseries/binned.py:285, in BinnedTimeSeries.read(self, filename, time_bin_start_column, time_bin_end_column, time_bin_size_column, time_bin_size_unit, time_format, time_scale, format, *args, **kwargs)\n230 \"\"\"\n231 Read and parse a file and returns a `astropy.timeseries.BinnedTimeSeries`.\n232\n(...)\n279\n280 \"\"\"\n282 try:\n283\n284     # First we try the readers defined for the BinnedTimeSeries class\n--> 285     return super().read(filename, format=format, *args, **kwargs)\n287 except TypeError:\n288\n289     # Otherwise we fall back to the default Table readers\n291     if time_bin_start_column is None:\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/table/connect.py:62, in TableRead.__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n59 units = kwargs.pop('units', None)\n60 descriptions = kwargs.pop('descriptions', None)\n---> 62 out = self.registry.read(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n64 # For some readers (e.g., ascii.ecsv), the returned `out` class is not\n65 # guaranteed to be the same as the desired output `cls`.

        "content": "To better understand and address the issue, we need to gather information about how the `ECSV` format and the `BinnedTimeSeries` class handle reading and writing files, especially in relation to `datetime64` data types. The specific sections of code mentioned in the issue, along with relevant classes and methods, will provide valuable context. Here are the API calls that will help us get this context:\n\n1. Search for the `BinnedTimeSeries` class to understand how it's structured and possibly how it reads from the ECSV format.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"BinnedTimeSeries\")\n    ```\n   \n2. Since the issue specifically mentions a problem with a commit affecting `ecsv.py`, it's important to look at the context around the line mentioned in the error message for any clues or related functionality.\n    ```python\n    get_code_around_line(\"ecsv.py\", 177, 10)\n    ```\n   \n3.

The issue describes a change in type checking that affects the ability to read files with `datetime64` columns. Therefore, examining the implementation of type checking in the ECSV functionality might provide insights. Since the exact location or method name for type checking is not given, we should search for code snippets that mention allowed data type values, as described in the ValueError.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"is not in allowed values ('bool', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64', 'float128', 'string')\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a comprehensive view of the relevant portions of code affecting this issue, enabling a more targeted approach to devising a solution."

The constructor accepts various parameters including start and end times of bins, the size of bins, and allows for the inclusion of additional data.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The `read` method in this class is directly related to the issue since the bug occurs when attempting to read an ECSV file into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object. This method is the entry point for dealing with files and therefore is likely where any adjustments need to be made to handle `datetime64` data.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior would ideally accommodate reading ECSV files with `datetime64` columns smoothly, allowing for seamless data interchange between different Astropy versions, specifically before and after the cited commit.\n\n#### 2. get_code_around_line for ecsv.py around line 177\n\n- **What it does**: The provided code snippet is from the `get_cols` method of the `EcsvHeader` class, within the context of processing columns specified in an ECSV file. It includes transferring attributes from the YAML metadata of the file's header to the columns of the table and checks if the data types of the columns are allowed in ECSV.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This section of code is responsible for the error encountered. The strict type checking here does not allow for `datetime64` types, which causes the `ValueError` when attempting to read an ECSV file holding such data types. The comment on lines 181-183 hints at a warning mechanism for unexpected data types instead of forbidding them outright, which might be a part of a solution or mitigation for the issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Though the strict type checking aims to ensure only valid ECSV datatypes are used, the intended behavior (in the context of the issue) would be more flexible, allowing `datetime64` types either by including them in allowed datatypes or through a compatibility layer that handles such types gracefully.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, there's an apparent need for further inspection into how datatypes are defined and validated within the ECSV handling portion of the codebase, specifically regarding `datetime64`. A closer look at the `ECSV_DATATYPES` constant or variable where allowed data types are defined might offer insights. Also, understanding how warnings for unexpected data types are implemented could give clues on how to adapt the current mechanism to offer backward compatibility or more flexible type handling.\n\nThe fact that the specific search for the code snippet raising the ValueError did not return results in the codebase suggests we might need to redefine the search with adjustable parameters or seek out related areas in the codebase dealing with datatype validation or the ECSV standard's implementation in Astropy.\n\n#### Additional API Calls for Further Context\n\nGiven this understanding, the following API calls could provide the needed contextual insights:\n\n1. **Search for ECSV datatype definitions**: We know that `ECSV_DATATYPES` plays a crucial role in determining allowed data types. Finding where `ECSV_DATATYPES` is defined and used could give us direct insight into how data types are handled and potentially how the code could be adjusted to account for `datetime64`.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ECSV_DATATYPES\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Examine warnings for unrecognized data types**: Since the code snippet mentioned implementing a warning for unexpected datatypes rather than outright blocking them, understanding how this warning mechanism is implemented and triggered could offer a pathway to handling `datetime64` data more effectively.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"unexpected datatype\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to explore both the structure that enforces datatype restrictions and the mechanisms that could allow for more flexibility, thus directly addressing the core of the issue described."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### ECSV_DATATYPES Definition\n\n- **What it does**: Defines the allowed datatypes for ECSV files as standard datatypes including various integer, floating-point, and string types. This serves as a validation checklist against which column datatypes are checked to ensure they comply with the ECSV standard.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue arises because `datetime64` is not included in `ECSV_DATATYPES`, leading to a `ValueError` when attempting to read an ECSV file with a `datetime64` column. The strict validation against `ECSV_DATATYPES` prevents backward compatibility with older files that may use datatypes not listed here.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: To resolve the issue while preserving the integrity and functionality of ECSV handling, the code should either include `datetime64` in the list of allowed `ECSV_DATATYPES` or implement a way to handle unsupported datatypes gracefully, ensuring that they don't cause a read failure. Since the addition of `datetime64` to `ECSV_DATATYPES` would expand the standard, the more immediate and less intrusive solution might be to enhance the mechanism that issues warnings for non-standard datatypes but still permits the reading of such data.\n\n#### Warnings for Unrecognized Data Types\n\n- **What it does**: This part of the code emits a warning when a column datatype is not included in `ECSV_DATATYPES`, indicating that while the datatype is used anyway, unexpected results may occur. This allows for some level of backward compatibility with older ECSV files that use non-standard datatypes such as `datetime64`.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This is the mechanism that potentially allows for handling of `datetime64` and other non-standard datatypes in a more user-friendly manner than outright failure. However, the warning can also signal that the code is on the cusp of being able to handle such cases more effectively, suggesting a workaround rather than a solution.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, this mechanism should be updated to not only warn but also to guide the handling process for unsupported datatypes in a way that minimizes user impact and retains data integrity. For `datetime64`, this could mean implementing specific handling instructions that convert or wrap these datatypes into a supported format for internal processing, while still maintaining the original data's fidelity when read.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo address the issue, the focus should be on enhancing the flexibility and robustness of datatype handling in ECSV files, particularly for `datetime64`. This could be done by adjusting the validation and warning mechanisms to either:\n\n1. Accept `datetime64` as a valid datatype by adding it to `ECSV_DATATYPES`; or\n2. More sophisticatedly handle non-standard datatypes to ensure backward compatibility without broadening the ECSV standard unnecessarily.\n\nConsidering the specific requirements of backward compatibility and minimal user impact, augmenting the existing warning mechanism to allow `datetime64` while ensuring that the data is correctly handled seems to be the most pragmatic immediate approach. This would involve detailed implementation strategies for converting or wrapping `datetime64` data upon reading, ensuring that both new and legacy ECSV files are supported equally well."

Instead of outright raising a `ValueError` when encountering an unsupported datatype, the method should better accommodate such scenarios. One approach could be to formally include `datetime64` in the list of supported `ECSV_DATATYPES`. Alternatively, if extending the standard is not desirable, the method could be adjusted to convert `datetime64` data into a supported format internally, ensuring compatibility while also issuing a warning that transformation has occurred to maintain data integrity. This would prevent the `ValueError` and allow users to read ECSV files created with older versions of Astropy without manual data manipulation, thus preserving the functionality of reading and processing ECSV files seamlessly across different Astropy versions."
