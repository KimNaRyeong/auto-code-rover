It will be colored based on xtick.color / ytick.color.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams.update({'ytick.labelcolor': 'red'})\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot([1.01e9,1.02e9,1.03e9])\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![wrong_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083612-dddf85ba-ebfa-4bf0-8ae0-3dce36c17198.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![correct_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083512-34b3b32f-5d3a-4242-8742-2269bb09c20c.png)\n### Additional information\nThe following patch seems to fix it for my simple usecases:\n```\ndiff --git a/axis.py b/axis.py\n--- a/axis.py\n+++ b/axis.py\t(date 1675716341305)\n@@ -2203,7 +2203,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'bottom'\n@@ -2456,7 +2456,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'left'\n```\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.3\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\nNone\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, I will invoke the following search API calls based on the details provided in the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the class where the bug is likely located:**\n   Since the issue revolves around the behavior of axis labeling, specifically the part where the color of the exponent label is not following `ytick.labelcolor` or `xtick.labelcolor`, and the provided patch mentions modifications in what seems to be `axis.py`, it's reasonable to start by identifying the relevant class or classes in this file.\n\n   However, the exact class names are not mentioned directly within the issue. Given the nature of the changes (modifying label color), we're likely dealing with classes that are responsible for axis rendering\u2014possibly something like `Axis`, `XAxis`, or `YAxis`.\n\n   Thus, the first step should involve searching for these class names within `axis.py`, as they are common class names used in matplotlib for handling axis properties:\n\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Axis\", \"axis.py\")`\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"XAxis\", \"axis.py\")`\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"YAxis\", \"axis.py\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods that could be related to the issue within the identified classes or file:**\n   Given the nature of the fix proposed in the issue, it\u2019s likely affecting methods that deal with the appearance of axis text\u2014specifically, methods that set or manipulate the offset text (the exponent label). The proposed patch changes how the color of this text is set, based on `xtick.labelcolor` and `ytick.labelcolor`.\n\n   It appears these changes occur within a method that might be responsible for rendering or updating the axis, though the method names are not mentioned. Based on common naming conventions and the functionality described, methods like `set_label`, `draw`, or something related to \"offset text\" could be relevant. We can initially search for method names that might apply to this scenario to narrow down where the proposed changes might fit:\n\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"set_label\", \"axis.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"draw\", \"axis.py\")`\n\n   In addition, because the patch directly mentions lines with modifications, looking around these modifications in the actual file could provide further context. While the exact line numbers of those changes are not directly known from the patch, searching for the specific code that's mentioned in the patch might help locate these areas in the file:\n\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']\", \"axis.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color']\", \"axis.py\")`\n\nThe goal of these API calls is to pinpoint the locations in the code that are directly related to the issue and to understand how the proposed changes integrate with the existing implementation. This approach should help in gathering all necessary context before proceeding with drafting a patch."
