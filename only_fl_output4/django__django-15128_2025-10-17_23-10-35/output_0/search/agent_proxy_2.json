The assertion that checks for overlap between `change_map` keys and values indicates a scenario where alias changes could introduce logical inconsistencies in the query structure. The intended behavior here would involve implementing a more sophisticated mechanism for generating new aliases that accounts for the current alias mappings in both the LHS and RHS of a combined query. This mechanism should ensure that new aliases are not only non-conflicting but also respect the logical structure and relationship between combined queries.\n\n#### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n- **Class:** `Query`\n- **Method:** `combine`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `combine` method's handling of aliases needs to be refined to ensure that when queries are merged, especially with the OR connector, it does not lead to situations that would violate the assertion in `change_aliases`. This may involve a pre-combination analysis of alias mappings from both queries to identify potential conflicts and an adjustment of the `change_map` logic to preemptively resolve these conflicts. Furthermore, the method could benefit from a more dynamic alias reuse strategy that considers the specifics of alias usage within the RHS query, ensuring that aliases are merged in a way that prevents conflicts and respects the semantics of the original queries.\n\nThese adjustments would address the root cause of the issue by ensuring that the alias mappings generated during query combinations are consistent and conflict-free, thereby avoiding the `AssertionError` and preserving the expected functionality of combined querysets."
