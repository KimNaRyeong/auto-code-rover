As the issue mentions moving messages to `default_error_messages`, it will be useful to search where `default_error_messages` might be defined or used within the `FormSet` class.

It is possible that:\n\n1. `FormSet` might exist under a different namespace or module that wasn't directly searched, or its definition could be dynamic or not straightforward, making direct class name searches ineffective.\n2. The usage and instantiation of `FormSet`, along with `default_error_messages`, are likely more abstracted or implemented differently than anticipated.\n\nConsidering these points and aiming to gather relevant context, the following revised approach should be taken:\n\n1. Since `FormSet` is closely related to Django's form handling, it's plausible that it may not be a standalone class but rather part of a larger module or system that wasn't directly searched initially. Hence, searching within files that are likely to contain form handling logic could be beneficial.\n\n2. Given that overriding error messages is a common feature in Django, searching for keywords related to form error handling, such as `add_error`, `clean`, or `non_form_errors`, and seeing where these connect back to form set logic could provide useful insights.\n\n3. Considering `inlineformset_factory` was mentioned as a related but separate matter, investigating its context might offer clues about how `FormSet` is instantiated or used, thereby providing indirect insight into where `FormSet`'s behavior can be modified.\n\nBased on the updated strategy, the following API calls are proposed:\n\n- Search for code snippets or classes related to form handling that might hint at `FormSet`'s existence or its error handling. This includes looking for file names or modules that are typically associated with forms in Django, such as anything containing `forms`, `fields`, or similar terms.\n  \n- Specifically look for `inlineformset_factory` usage and definitions since this could lead us to how `FormSet` is instantiated and may indirectly reveal where the error messages can be overridden.\n\nAPI calls to invoke:\n\n- `search_code(\"inlineformset_factory\")`\n- `search_code(\"non_form_errors\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"forms.py\", \"add_error\")` \n\nThese calls are made with the intention of finding indirect references or implementations related to `FormSet` and its error handling mechanism."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Therefore, I won't specify bug locations and intended behavior without the necessary underlying detail to do so accurately. \n\nHowever, since I mistakenly instructed to leave sections empty without following the protocol for gathering more context, here's an approached answer assuming we had gathered the necessary details or in a hypothetical scenario where we understand what needs to be done based on common Django patterns:\n\n1. **More Context Needed**: \n   \n   Since we do not have the actual search results due to the protocol of this task, an incorrect directive was given previously. However, in a real scenario, we would need to make sure we understand exactly how `FormSet` and `inlineformset_factory` are implemented and how they handle error messages.\n\n2. **Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behavior**:\n\n   - **Bug Location 1**: \n     - **File**: (hypothetical) `django/forms/formsets.py`\n     - **Class**: FormSet\n     - **Method**: N/A (This would involve modifying or adding to the class attributes, specifically the handling of `default_error_messages`.)\n\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure the `FormSet` class contains a `default_error_messages` attribute that aggregates error messages, including those for too few and too many forms. Modify the `__init__` method or relevant method handling instantiation to allow passing of `error_messages` as an argument which would override the default ones. This could involve merging passed `error_messages` with `default_error_messages` at the `FormSet` instantiation time, taking precedence when specific error message keys are provided.\n\n   - **Bug Location 2**: \n     - **File**: (possibly) in the same file as `FormSet`\n     - **Usage Context**: `inlineformset_factory`\n     \n     - **Intended Behavior**: While directly modifying `inlineformset_factory()` might not be required for the issue described, ensuring it or related factory functions can pass `error_messages` down to `FormSet` instances they create is crucial. This might involve checking `inlineformset_factory`'s signature and logic in a file like `django/forms/models.py` to ensure it accepts `error_messages` and correctly forwards them to the `FormSet` constructor.\n\nThese hypothetical solutions aim to provide a more flexible and customizable error handling mechanism within Django's `FormSet` class, aligning with the issue's intent without affecting the existing functionality for users not utilizing the new override capabilities."
