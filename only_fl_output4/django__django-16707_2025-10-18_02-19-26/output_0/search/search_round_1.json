        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides significant insights into the issue and helps outline potential approaches to resolving it.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n1. **`DateField` class in `django/forms/fields.py`**:\n   - This class inherits from `BaseTemporalField` and specifies `input_formats` as a lazy-loaded value fetched using `formats.get_format_lazy(\"DATE_INPUT_FORMATS\")`.\n   - There is no custom `__str__` method defined within `DateField`, which suggests that the class inherits the default `__str__` behavior from its parent class or `object`. The default behavior may not be equipped to handle the list type of `input_formats` properly when attempting to print it directly.\n\n2. **Absence of a custom `__str__` method in `DateField`**:\n   - The fact that a `__str__` method was not found indicates that the error occurs due to Python's default string representation of objects not handling lists as expected when printed directly. Since `input_formats` is a list, attempting to print it without conversion results in a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Presence of `input_formats` in `django/forms/fields.py`**:\n   - The `input_formats` attribute is directly associated with how date input formats are specified and used within the `DateField` class. Its implementation as a lazy-loaded list is essential for flexibility and customization of date formats.\n\n### Relationship Between Code and Bug\n\nThe bug arises because there is no specific handling for converting the `input_formats` list into a string representation when the `DateField().input_formats` is printed. Python's default `__str__` method, which `DateField` relies on (due to the absence of a custom implementation), doesn't automatically convert lists to string representations suitable for printing.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for `print(DateField().input_formats)` to output a human-readable string representation of the `input_formats` list, without raising a `TypeError`. This could be achieved by implementing a custom `__str__` method (or possibly modifying how `input_formats` is represented or accessed) to ensure that lists are converted to strings in a way that is meaningful and readable.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Implement or recommend a custom `__str__` method within `DateField` or a higher-level prototype from which `DateField` inherits, that properly handles the conversion of `input_formats` to a string.\n- Alternatively, a utility function or method could be added or utilized, specifically for converting lists like `input_formats` to a string when printing or logging is needed.\n- It may also be worthwhile to check how the parent class `BaseTemporalField` handles `__str__`, as any changes or implementations there might inherit down to `DateField`.\n\nGiven the above analysis, a more targeted search might involve looking into how the parent classes of `DateField` implement `__str__` or handle attribute printing, suggesting a need to further explore the code base, specifically around `BaseTemporalField` and its `__str__` method, if any."

This method should check if the attribute being printed is a list and, if so, convert it to a string in a readable format before returning it.\n\nFor the `DateField` class specifically, since no custom `__str__` method is present, and the base class does not have an adequate handler, the solution could be as follows:\n\n- Introduce a `__str__` method within `DateField` that specifically checks for attributes of type list (such as `input_formats`) when attempting to print them. This method would implement logic to convert list attributes to a readable string representation.\n- Example method definition:\n```python\ndef __str__(self):\n    if isinstance(self.input_formats, list):\n        return \"Input Formats: \" + ', '.join(self.input_formats)\n    else:\n        return super(DateField, self).__str__()\n```\n\nThis addition would ensure that trying to print `DateField().input_formats` directly would result in a user-friendly string output, addressing the issue with minimal changes to the existing codebase."
