Based on the updated requirements and conditions, I've revised the Python script below. We must ensure that the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed or not present, and prints a detailed stack trace of the issue when it's present. The script uses the `print_stacktrace` function for a clear and standardized display of errors.

This script will attempt to replicate the issue with the NDCG score computation using binary relevance and a list containing a single element. It should raise an `AssertionError` if the expected issue is identified (i.e., the computation is unsuccessfully due to the format of input data), otherwise, it will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_ndcg_with_binary_relevance_and_single_element():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]
    
    try:
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        # If the score is successfully computed, the expected issue is not present
        print("Success: Computation of NDCG score did not raise any errors.")
        exit(0)  # Exit successfully indicating the issue is fixed or not present
    except ValueError as e:
        # Check if the error message matches the expected issue
        expected_error_msg = "Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported. Got binary instead"
        if expected_error_msg in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # Exiting with code 1 indicates the issue is present as described
            exit(1)
        else:
            # If the error message does not match the expected issue, it's an unexpected error
            print("An unexpected error occurred, not matching the expected issue description.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other unexpected exceptions and print the stack trace
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_ndcg_with_binary_relevance_and_single_element()
```

This Python script, `reproducer.py`, should reproduce the specific issue as described when run in the root directory of the affected project. If the computation of the NDCG score fails due to the expected ValueError (i.e., the conditions that trigger the reported bug), the script correctly captures this as the issue being present, exiting with code 1 and printing the relevant stack trace. Conversely, if the computation succeeds or fails for reasons other than the expected ValueError, it will either exit cleanly with code 0 (indicating no problem or a fixed issue) or with code 1 for other unexpected errors, respectively.
