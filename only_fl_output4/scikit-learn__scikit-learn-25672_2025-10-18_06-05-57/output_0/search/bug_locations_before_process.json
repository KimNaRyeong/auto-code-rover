        "intended_behavior": "Amend the method to handle the case of binary relevance with a single-element list gracefully. Before calling _check_dcg_target_type, introduce a condition to check if y_true consists of a single binary element and manage the scoring for this specific case appropriately, potentially bypassing the call to _check_dcg_target_type if that resolution is chosen. This adjustment should ensure that for cases of binary relevance with a single element, ndcg_score computes the score correctly or provides a clear, user-friendly explanation of why such an input is not supported, ensuring the clarity of the error messaging. This preserves the integrity and functionality of ndcg_score while resolving the inability to process single-element binary relevance lists."
