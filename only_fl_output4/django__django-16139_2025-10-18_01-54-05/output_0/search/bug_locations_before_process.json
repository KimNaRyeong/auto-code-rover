        "intended_behavior": "The code within the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm` class needs to be adjusted to dynamically generate the URL for the password change link based on the user\u2019s primary key instead of using a static relative path. The current implementation uses `\"../password/\"` as the relative path, which causes issues when accessing the UserAdmin interface in a non-standard way, such as through a `to_field` reference with a UUID. The proposed change involves replacing `password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")` with a more dynamic approach that considers the actual path needed to reach the password change form for the specific user instance being modified: `password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")`"
