Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue efficiently, we need to gather specific details regarding the implementation of the `convert_to` function as well as any closely related classes or functions that involve units, like joules or seconds. Given the behavior described in the issue, it seems there might be a problem with how the function handles the conversion logic or interprets unit expressions.\n\nHere are the necessary API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"convert_to\")`: This call is essential to locate the `convert_to` function within the project and understand its implementation details.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Quantity\")`: Since the issue involves unit conversion, it's likely that a class dealing with quantities or units (like \"Quantity\") might have a significant role. This call helps to find such a class if it exists.\n\n3. `search_code(\"joule*second,joule\")`: This call aims to find how the specific example given in the issue is handled or if any similar conversion examples are specifically addressed in the codebase.\n\n4. `search_code(\"kg*m**2/s**2\")`: Since the fundamental issue seems to relate to how unit expressions are parsed or converted, finding code related to the definition or manipulation of units like `kg*m**2/s**2` might provide additional insights.\n\nThese API calls should furnish the necessary context around the issue's description, the implementation of the `convert_to` function, and the handling of unit expressions within the project."
