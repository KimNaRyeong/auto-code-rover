Given your revised requirements, here's an updated `reproducer.py` script that more accurately encompasses the conditions to raise an `AssertionError` when the described issue is present, based on your detailed issue report. This script specifically targets the problem of a hardcoded `Accept` header causing a `406 Not Acceptable` response:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_custom_http_headers_support():
    """
    Tests the ability to set custom HTTP headers in requests, specifically targeting
    the scenario described in the issue.
    """
    # URL and headers as per the GitHub Actions badge scenario described in the issue.
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4',
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9'
    }

    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)
    
    # Expecting a 20x status code implies success, which signifies the absence of the issue.
    if response.status_code // 100 != 2:
        raise AssertionError(f"Unexpected status code {response.status_code}, indicating potential issue with custom HTTP headers support.")

try:
    test_custom_http_headers_support()
    print("The HTTP headers issue is not present, test passed successfully.")
except AssertionError as error:
    print_stacktrace(error)
    exit(1)
except Exception as error:
    print_stacktrace(error)
    exit(1)
```

In this script, `test_custom_http_headers_support` checks if making a `HEAD` request to the specified GitHub Actions badge URL with a custom `Accept` header different from the one hardcoded into Sphinx's `linkcheck.py` results in a successful (200 OK or similar) response. If the request returns a non-20x response (indicating the server did not accept the custom `Accept` header, reproducing the issue of a `406 Not Acceptable` response), an `AssertionError` is raised.

The expectation with this script is straightforward. If the underlying issue (inability to use custom `Accept` headers leading to a `406` error) is present, the script raises an `AssertionError`. When the necessary functionality for custom HTTP headers support is correctly implemented, the script should conclude successfully, indicating the issue is resolved.
