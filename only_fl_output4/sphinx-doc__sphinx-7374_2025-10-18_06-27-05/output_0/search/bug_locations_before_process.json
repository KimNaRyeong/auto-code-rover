        "intended_behavior": "The `PythonDomain` class should ensure that when Python function names are translated to fragment identifiers, they retain their original character format, including underscores, to maintain backward compatibility with existing external and internal links. If this class or its methods directly or indirectly influence how fragment identifiers are generated (especially in converting identifiers to a web-friendly format), it should either avoid changing underscores to dashes for Python functions or provide a configurable option to dictate this behavior. This preserves the functionality of accurately referencing Python functions in the documentation while preventing the breaking of links due to identifier format changes."
