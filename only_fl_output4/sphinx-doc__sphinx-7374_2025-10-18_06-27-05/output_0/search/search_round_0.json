        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to locate where and how the fragment identifiers for Python functions are generated and handled within the project codebase. Since the issue points towards a change in the behavior of generating anchors from underscores to dashes, and mentions its impact on `nbsphinx` and external links, we should start by investigating relevant parts of the code that handle these fragment identifications. Based on the provided descriptions, the following API calls will be helpful:\n\n1. **Search for the code responsible for generating fragment identifiers**: Since the issue mentions a change in anchor generation for Python functions documented in Sphinx, we need to locate the piece of code responsible for this transformation.\n\n   `search_code(\"anchors for Python functions\")` or `search_code(\"fragment identifier\")`\n\n2. **Locate where the IDs are being modified or generated**: We need to find where in the code the transition from underscores to dashes for Python function names occurs, as this is the crux of the issue.\n\n   `search_code(\"_.replace('-', '_')\")` and `search_code(\"_.replace('_', '-')\")`\n\n3. **Examine integration with `nbsphinx`**: Given that `nbsphinx` is mentioned as being directly affected, it might be beneficial to examine how Sphinx extensions or configurations integrate with `nbsphinx`, even though the issue might be more broadly within Sphinx itself rather than `nbsphinx` specifically.\n\n   `search_code(\"nbsphinx\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a broad starting point to identify relevant portions of the code involved in generating, modifying, or using the fragment identifiers for Python functions in documentation. Once we locate these areas, we can further refine our search or directly inspect the code to understand the cause and develop a patch."
