        "intended_behavior": "The method `subfigures` should ensure that the values provided to `wspace` and `hspace` parameters effectively adjust the spacing between subfigures within a figure. This method constructs a `GridSpec` with `wspace` and `hspace` parameters, which are intended to set the fraction of the average subfigure width/height to be reserved for space between subfigures. To resolve the issue, the method should be reviewed and possibly adjusted to guarantee that these parameters are correctly utilized within the layout engine, especially when layout adjustments or constraints (like `tight_layout` or `constrained_layout`) are applied to the figure. This might involve ensuring that `GridSpec` settings are not being overridden or ignored in subsequent layout calculations and rendering steps, preserving the intended functionality of customizable subfigure spacing."
