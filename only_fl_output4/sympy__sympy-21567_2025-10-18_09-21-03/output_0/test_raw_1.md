This adjusted script includes the missing import for `tanh` which caused the previous NameError, ensuring all the functions used are defined. It follows the instructions to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, printing a detailed stack trace for the error. The script will exit with code 0 if any of the assertions fail due to the issue not being fixed, or it will print a success message indicating the issue does not exist if all assertions pass.
