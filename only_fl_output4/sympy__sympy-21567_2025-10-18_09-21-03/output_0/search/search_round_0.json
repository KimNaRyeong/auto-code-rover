        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how the `expand_trig` function currently processes trigonometric functions, particularly focusing on how it deals with `csch` and `sech`. Given the examples provided in the issue, it's also necessary to see the implementation for `csc` and `sec` to understand the intended expansion behavior. Therefore, I'm selecting the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"expand_trig\")`: To find where the `expand_trig` method is defined and used in the codebase. This will give us an entry point to understand how expansion rules are applied to different trigonometric functions.\n\n2. `search_code(\"expand_trig(csch\")`: We'll look for any occurrence of `csch` being used with `expand_trig` in the codebase. This could help understand if there's an existing partial implementation or call that we might need to extend or modify.\n\n3. `search_code(\"expand_trig(sech\")`: Similarly, this will help us find if `sech` is handled or mentioned somewhere in context with `expand_trig`, indicating if we have a specific logic that needs to be updated or expanded.\n\n4. `search_code(\"expand_trig(csc\")`: Given the issue's hint towards the expansion behavior of `csc`, we'll look for its implementation details to possibly replicate or adapt its logic for `csch`.\n\n5. `search_code(\"expand_trig(sec\")`: This will help us understand the expansion behavior for `sec`, which might give clues on how to implement similar behavior for `sech`."
