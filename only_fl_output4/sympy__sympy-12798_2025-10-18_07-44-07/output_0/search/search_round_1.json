Given that `ff` and `rf` are likely methods or functions in SymPy, we should start by searching for these methods to understand their current implementation. Then, we might need to look at the specific commit or file that was modified in the pull request to understand what changed. Since the pull request URL was mentioned but not direct file paths or commit hashes, we'll focus on finding the methods first.\n\nLet's use the following API calls:\n- `search_method(\"ff\")`: This will help us identify where the `ff` method is defined in the SymPy codebase.\n- `search_method(\"rf\")`: Similarly, this call will help us locate the `rf` method in the SymPy project. \n\nThese initial steps are crucial for understanding the scope of the changes made and formulating a strategy for reverting them."

We could search for them as part of code snippets instead, which might be more successful if these are referenced within other methods or classes.\n- Another approach could be looking for more context around these functions by searching for code snippets or comments that reference `ff` and `rf`. This can highlight where and how they are used or defined.\n- Since the names `ff` and `rf` are relatively short and could potentially be part of larger names or have been refactored, it's essential to consider broader terms possibly related to their full names or functionalities.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls might offer more insights:\n\n- `search_code(\"ff\")`: This should help us find references to `ff` in the code, which might include definitions, usage in functions, or discussions in comments.\n- `search_code(\"rf\")`: Similar to the above, this call will help us identify areas in the code where `rf` is mentioned or used.\n\nThese searches will hopefully provide more context on how `ff` and `rf` are incorporated into the SymPy codebase, leading to insight into the relevant pull request's changes and how to approach reverting them."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
