        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `ff` and `rf` definitions change in SymPy 1.0, and considering the description and the need to revert changes made in a specific pull request, it's essential to first find where these definitions are in the codebase. Given that `ff` and `rf` are likely methods or functions in SymPy, we should start by searching for these methods to understand their current implementation. Then, we might need to look at the specific commit or file that was modified in the pull request to understand what changed. Since the pull request URL was mentioned but not direct file paths or commit hashes, we'll focus on finding the methods first.\n\nLet's use the following API calls:\n- `search_method(\"ff\")`: This will help us identify where the `ff` method is defined in the SymPy codebase.\n- `search_method(\"rf\")`: Similarly, this call will help us locate the `rf` method in the SymPy project. \n\nThese initial steps are crucial for understanding the scope of the changes made and formulating a strategy for reverting them."
