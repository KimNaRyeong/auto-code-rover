To address the need for a correct script that reproduces the issue described, we'll create `reproducer.py` that explicitly checks for the unexpected alteration of the contour levels when specified outside the data range. This time, the focus will be on ensuring the condition for raising an `AssertionError` aligns with the described issue if Matplotlib overrides the user-defined `levels`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_contour_level_override():
    # Prepare a simple data set with values clearly below the level of interest
    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 4)
    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 4)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    data = np.sin(X) * np.cos(Y)  # This will produce values in the range [-1, 1]

    # Attempt to contour with a level that's outside the data range
    try:
        # Plotting with a level outside the data range.
        plt.figure()
        myplot = plt.contour(X, Y, data, levels=[100])
        plt.close()

        # Checking if levels have been overridden
        levels = myplot.levels
        assert len(levels) == 1 and levels[0] == 100, "Contour levels have been incorrectly overridden."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_contour_level_override()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exiting with non-zero to indicate failure to replicate the issue correctly
    else:
        print("Test passed: Contour levels were not overridden as initially described.")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with zero when the test passes engagement criteria
```

This script addresses the intended behavior based on the description provided for the Matplotlib issue. It uses a simple test case where contour levels specified by the user are clearly outside the range of the generated data. The script then checks whether these levels are unexpectedly altered by Matplotlib to something other than what was specified (in the example case, `[100]`). 

The `assert` statement is specifically designed to fail if Matplotlib changes the specified contour level to anything other than `[100]`, as was mentioned in the issue description. Therefore, the script should raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, providing a clear indication through the `print_stacktrace` function before exiting with code `1`. Conversely, when the issue is fixed, and Matplotlib respects the user-specified levels, the script will report that the test has passed and exit with code `0`.
