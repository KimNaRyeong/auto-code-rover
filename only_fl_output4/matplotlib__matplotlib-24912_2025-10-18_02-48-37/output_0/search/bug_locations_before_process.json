        "intended_behavior": "In order to resolve the issue, the method `_process_contour_level_args` within the `ContourSet` class must be modified to accommodate a new keyword argument that allows users to override the automatic adjustment of contour levels (`self.levels`) when the specified levels fall outside the dataset's z-range. This keyword argument (`override_autoscale`) should be checked within the conditional statement that currently sets `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]` if all requested levels are outside the data range. If `override_autoscale` is true, this adjustment should be bypassed, thereby preserving the user-specified levels regardless of whether they fall within the data range. This implementation should ensure:\n\n- Existing functionality remains unchanged by default (i.e., without specifying the new argument), maintaining backward compatibility.\n- When the override is active, user-defined contour levels are retained as specified, even if they do not align with the data range.\n\nThe addition of this new keyword argument would likely also necessitate updates elsewhere in the code where `ContourSet` or the `contour/contourf` functions are invoked or defined, ensuring the new argument is properly passed through. However, based on the current context, the primary modification to fix the bug is located in the mentioned method."
