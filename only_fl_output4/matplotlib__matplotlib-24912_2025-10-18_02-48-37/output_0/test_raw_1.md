Given the clarification needed to create a script that raises an `AssertionError` as specified when the issue is present, and reflects the behavior described in the reported Matplotlib issue, let's reformulate the `reproducer.py` script. The goal here is to ensure that the assertion fails if the `levels` attribute is changed unexpectedly by Matplotlib, reproducing the described issue where user-specified contour levels outside the data range are inappropriately altered by the library.

Let's implement the adjustments considering the provided function to print a stack trace more accurately.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_plot_with_levels_outside_range():
    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)
    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    data = np.sin(X) * np.cos(Y) * 10  # Multiply by 10 to ensure data range falls below the level 100

    try:
        # Note: the reported behavior differs from Matplotlib's documentation and expectations.
        # To reproduce the specific issue, we check if Matplotlib inappropriately modifies the specified levels.
        myplot = plt.contour(X, Y, data, levels=[100])
        levels = myplot.levels
        assert np.array_equal(levels, [100]), f"Incorrect contour levels: Expected [100], got {levels}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_plot_with_levels_outside_range()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script specifically addresses the reported issue by ensuring `data` produces a range that does not include the specific contour level of `100`, thus correctly setting up the test scenario as per the issue description. The script checks if the result of the `levels` attribute strictly equals `[100]`, as it should be when Matplotlib respects the explicitly given contour levels, despite them being outside the actual data range.

If Matplotlib's behavior has changed or if there was a mistake in expecting an error or change in behavior when executing the test, the script's behavior might differ (e.g., exiting with code `0` if the issue is fixed or not present). However, based on the issue's description, this script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the problem occurs, printing a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.
