This argument should influence the `write` method to output header rows based on the content of `header_rows`, similar to how it is handled in the `fixedwidth.py` implementation. The `write` method should be updated or extended to use the `header_rows` content to generate the appropriate header lines in the resulting RestructuredText table, prioritizing this functionality while maintaining existing features for RST output."

        "intended_behavior": "Extend the `write` method to dynamically handle `header_rows`, such that if `header_rows` is provided, the method utilizes this for generating the table header in the RestructuredText output. This involves adapting or revising the logic to insert names and units (if provided in `header_rows`) above the standard column headers, ensuring the output aligns with the RestructuredText table standards. The method should gracefully handle cases where `header_rows` are not provided, defaulting to the current behavior."
