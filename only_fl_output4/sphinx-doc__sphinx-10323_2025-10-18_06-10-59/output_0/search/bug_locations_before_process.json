        "intended_behavior": "The method handling the `literalinclude` directive options should preserve the indentation of the text provided through the `prepend` option when it is being added to the beginning of the included code block. Additionally, it should ensure that the `dedent` operation only applies to the code content from the included file itself, not affecting the indentation level of the `prepend` or `append` text. This would require adding logic to separately manage the indentation for `prepend`/`append` content and the included content, allowing `dedent` to only impact the latter. A possible implementation may involve calculating the indentation level of the included content after `dedent` is applied and then applying the necessary indentation to `prepend` or `append` text so it matches the document's intended layout. This ensures that the `prepend` and `append` functionalities can be used flexibly without unintended effects on text indentation, preserving or enhancing the directive's usability for documentation authors."
