        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `Post` class definition in the codebase. This will help us understand any custom methods or overrides that could be affecting the deletion process:**\n   - `search_class(\"Post\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `User` class definition in the codebase. Since the issue involves a ManyToMany relation to `User`, it's important to understand any specifics about the `User` model that might be relevant:**\n   - `search_class(\"User\")`\n\n3. **Search within the `admin.py` file for the `PostAdmin` class, because the issue seems to be related to how the `PostAdmin` is handling search fields that include a ManyToMany field:**\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"PostAdmin\", \"admin.py\")`\n\n4. **The error mentions an issue with `delete_queryset` within the `django.contrib.admin.options.py` file, so it would be useful to get the implementation of this method in the `PostAdmin` class if it's overridden or check its usage:**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"delete_queryset\", \"PostAdmin\")`\n\n5. **The error traceback also points towards a problem occurring during the `delete()` call on a queryset. It might be beneficial to locate where `queryset.delete()` is explicitly called within the `PostAdmin` class, as this could be an area where the fix needs to be applied. If `delete_queryset` isn\u2019t overridden in `PostAdmin`, getting the usage context directly from the Django source might be necessary, but since we can't search external libraries, focusing on our codebase usage is our aim:**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"queryset.delete()\", \"admin.py\")`\n\nGiven the traceback and mention of a regression potentially introduced by changes in preserving filters upon deletion and the involvement of `.distinct()`, these API calls should help us locate the relevant sections of our codebase to further investigate and come up with a suitable patch."
