        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals pivotal insights into the Django migrations system, particularly regarding how migrations are recorded, applied, and potentially, how they could be managed to address the stated issue. Let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. MigrationRecorder Class (from `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`)\n- **What it does:** This class handles the recording of migrations in the `django_migrations` table, tracking which migrations have been applied or unapplied to a database. It offers methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` for managing these records, and `applied_migrations` to retrieve a set of migrations that have been marked as applied.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue arises when the `django_migrations` table maintains records of migrations that no longer exist due to squashing. This class is directly involved in adding, removing, and querying those records, making it a crucial point for implementing a solution.\n- **Intended behavior:** The class should be extended or modified to include a mechanism for validating migration records against the actual, existing migration files before considering a migration as applied. Essentially, it should ensure the integrity of the record keeping with the current state of migration files.\n\n### 2. apply_migration Method (from `django/db/migrations/executor.py`)\n- **What it does:** This method is responsible for applying a migration to the database, either as a normal or \"fake\" application, and recording that application if it successfully alters the database schema without any deferred SQL commands that need to be executed later.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** When new migrations resemble the names of previously squashed and deleted migrations, there's a risk that Django won't apply them due to false positives in the `django_migrations` record. This method's handling of the migration application and its recording process is central to avoiding such conflicts.\n- **Intended behavior:** Modifications could involve adding checks before recording a migration as applied, ensuring that the migration file exists, and potentially, is not flagged as replaced by a squashed migration that's already been applied.\n\n### 3. django_migrations Code References\n- **What it does:** The references to `django_migrations` in both the `MigrationRecorder` and `executor.py` indicate places where migrations are registered as applied or are checked against for deciding on application.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** These references are where the code interacts with the database table that's central to the issue. Ensuring that only migrations corresponding to existing files are recorded here is a fundamental part of addressing the problem.\n- **Intended behavior:** The interaction with the `django_migrations` table should be closely tied to the actual, filesystem-based state of migrations, requiring a more dynamic validation against the migrations present in the codebase.\n\n### Additional Considerations and Next Steps:\n- The attempt to find \"MigrateCommand\" and \"squashmigrations\" might have failed due to them not being defined in the expected places or manner. Adjusting search terms or looking for alternative entry points to these functionalities might be necessary. For example, since \"MigrateCommand\" wasn't found, searching for where and how Django's `migrate` command is implemented might uncover relevant code (e.g., searching for files related to command handling or management commands in general).\n- The issue might benefit from exploring how Django manages its migrations metadata more broadly, including looking into how squashed migrations are treated by the system and exploring further the lifecycle of a migration from creation, through application, to being possibly squashed or deleted.\n\nThis analysis indicates potential areas of the Django codebase that may require modification or extension to address the issue while maintaining the integrity and historical value of migration records. A more thorough understanding of the migration lifecycle and system's internal validation mechanisms will be paramount in developing a comprehensive solution."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This method, potentially named `validate_migration_files`, should compare the list of migrations recorded in the database with those available on the filesystem. If a recorded migration does not have a corresponding file, it should be marked for potential removal, considering the nuances discussed in the issue (e.g., handling squashed migrations and ensuring that migrations mentioned in the `replaces` list of other migrations are not prematurely removed).\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/db/migrations/executor.py`\n     - **Class:** `MigrationExecutor`\n     - **Method:** `record_migration`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `record_migration` method to include a call to the new `validate_migration_files` method from the `MigrationRecorder` class before actually recording a new migration. This ensures that the `django_migrations` table does not contain records of migrations that are no longer present in the file system. It's crucial that this adjustment is made carefully to preserve the integrity of the migrations process, especially in environments with multiple databases or complex migration histories.\n\nThese adjustments aim to address the core of the issue by ensuring that the database's migration records accurately reflect the state of the migration files present in the project. This careful management of migration records will prevent the problems described in the issue while maintaining the existing functionality and reliability of the Django migrations system."
