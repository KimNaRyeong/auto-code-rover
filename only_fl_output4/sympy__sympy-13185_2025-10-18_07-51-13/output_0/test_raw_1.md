The following Python script is a refined approach to reproduce the issue regarding `cse()` with `MatrixSymbol` indexing in SymPy. This script directly asserts the observed behavior (assigning full matrices `a` and `b` to single variables `x0` and `x2` respectively) which is not expected and would indeed indicate a problem. If there's an issue, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, otherwise, it will exit with code 0 indicating no issue was found.

```python
import sympy as sp
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Create symbols for a 4x4 matrix named 'a' and 'b'
        a = sp.MatrixSymbol('a', 4, 4)
        b = sp.MatrixSymbol('b', 4, 4)

        # Dummy expression using these symbols
        expr = a*b

        # Perform Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
        cse_subs, _ = sp.cse(expr)

        # The issue is about cse_subs treating matrices 'a', 'b' as single entries
        # We expect symbolic references to elements of 'a', 'b', not the matrices directly.
        assert all(not isinstance(sym, sp.MatrixSymbol) or sym not in [a, b] for sym, _ in cse_subs), \
            "cse() treated MatrixSymbols as single entries which is incorrect."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print("No issue detected with cse() for MatrixSymbol indexing.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script checks if the common subexpressions (in `cse_subs`) include unrecognized single-entry references to the matrices `a` and `b`. If such behavior is observed, it asserts an error. Otherwise, it confirms that no issue was detected, implying the specific problem has been addressed in the later versions or the setup used doesn't reproduce the issue. Make sure to run this in the appropriate environment where the issue is expected to occur for effective validation.
