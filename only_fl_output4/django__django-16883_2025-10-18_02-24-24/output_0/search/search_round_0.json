Here are the API calls I would make to gather the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the `inspectdb.Command` class to understand its current structure and implementation**: This will help in identifying where and how the table name to model conversion logic is currently implemented.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Command\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search within a specific file for the `inspectdb.Command` class**: Since the issue mentions a specific file where the column names method already exists, it's useful to look at the class definition in that context to see if any related methods or properties are nearby.\n   ```python\n   search_class_in_file(\"Command\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the `table2model` method or any similar method mentioned as a proposal**: Given the issue's description about the proposed override mechanism, checking if there's an existing `table2model` or similar function is the next step. Since the exact name isn't mentioned, the initial search is broader.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"table2model\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the existing method for column name conversion**: This is directly referenced in the issue, and understanding its implementation will provide insights into how to best implement a similar feature for table name conversion.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_field_type\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Get code around the existing column name method**: To understand how the current column name logic is integrated, looking at the surrounding code could give clues on where to place the new table name logic.\n   ```python\n   get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\", 265, 10)\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing code structure related to the issue, how the `inspectdb` command works, its method of converting database table names to model names, and where the proposed changes could be integrated into the Django project."
