        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of `FilteredRelation` should be enhanced to properly handle conditions that include nested relations. Currently, it simply accepts a `condition=Q()` argument without validating or parsing nested relations. The intended behavior is to implement logic within this method (or supporting methods called within it) that can interpret nested `Q` conditions, translating them into viable SQL constructs without raising errors. This implementation should preserve the class's ability to handle simple conditions (non-nested), ensuring backward compatibility. Additionally, detailed error messages or documentation should guide developers on how to correctly specify conditions with nested relations, improving the developer experience."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `annotate` method itself might not be directly modified to address this bug, ensuring that it can seamlessly work with the updated `FilteredRelation` is crucial. After enhancing `FilteredRelation` to support nested conditions, appropriate tests in connection with `annotate` should be conducted to confirm that nested relations passed via `FilteredRelation` in `annotate` calls are correctly interpreted and executed. It's essential to verify that these enhancements do not disrupt the existing functionalities of `annotate`, such as handling simple annotations, aggregations, and conditions without nested relations."
