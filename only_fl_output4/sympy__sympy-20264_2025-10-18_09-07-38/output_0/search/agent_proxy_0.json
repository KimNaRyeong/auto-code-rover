Searching for this class will help us find its definition and implementation details.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"doprint\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: Since the `doprint` method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is a likely starting point for debugging, getting its implementation in the `LatexPrinter` class is crucial.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Pow\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: The `_print_Pow` method is implicated in the recursion issue specifically for handling instances of `Pow`, making its examination important.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Mul\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: Like `_print_Pow`, this method is referenced in the context of the error and could be intimately involved in how expressions are being recursively processed."
