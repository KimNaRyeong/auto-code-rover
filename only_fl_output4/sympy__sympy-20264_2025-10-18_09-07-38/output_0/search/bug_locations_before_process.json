        "intended_behavior": "This method should specifically handle cases where `Pow` objects have negative or fractional exponents that do not evaluate to simpler forms, potentially causing recursion. It should ensure that expressions like `Pow(Rational(1, n), -1, evaluate=False)` are processed into a non-recursive LaTeX form, possibly by preemptively evaluating them to a different structure that LaTeXPrinter can handle without entering a recursion. This might involve checking for conditions that are known to lead to recursion and applying alternative processing strategies for these cases, preserving the method's ability to accurately translate `Pow` expressions into LaTeX format."

        "intended_behavior": "This method aims to handle the printer's approach to multiplication, but requires adjustments to prevent infinite recursion when dealing with certain forms of expressions (such as those involving negative or rational powers). The method should guarantee that multiplications involving expressions that can lead to recursion errors are detected early and handled in a manner that either simplifies the expression before printing or breaks down the process into simpler, non-recursive steps. This may include better handling or rearranging of `Pow` objects within `Mul` expressions to avoid the recursive loop created by back-and-forth calls between `_print_Mul` and other methods like `_print_Pow`."
