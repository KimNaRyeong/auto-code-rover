I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

        "content": "The search results provide both direct feedback on the queries made and indirect insights into how to proceed further. Let's analyze the outcomes step by step and plan our next steps accordingly.\n\n### Analysis of the Outcomes\n\n1. **Search for Specific Code Snippets:**\n    - Both `selector.rect.set_color` and `selector.rectprops.update` do not appear in the codebase. Similarly, `selector.artists[0].set_color` wasn't found.\n    - **Insight:** These snippets might come from a higher abstraction or a specific pattern not directly labeled as such in the code. The `selector` might be a part of a complex feature not directly exposed by a class or method named \"Selector\" or it might be managed under different names or patterns.\n\n2. **Search for Class Selector:**\n    - The class `Selector` was not found.\n    - **Insight:** The issue might not be with a `Selector` class per se but could involve a more dynamically defined feature or a component of another class. It suggests we should look into how selectors are implemented or handled more broadly in the codebase, such as through mixins or utility functions rather than through a standalone class.\n\n3. **Search for `set_color` Method:**\n    - The method `set_color` was found in various files, indicating it's a commonly used method across different elements (patches, lines, texts, etc.).\n    - **Insight:** Since setting color is a common action across various components, the bug might be related to a change in how color properties are propagated or stored within these components. Reviewing how `set_color` is implemented or called in relation to selector-like features could uncover the needed migration path.\n\n4. **Search for `update_props` Method:**\n    - This method was not found, suggesting no direct method named `update_props` exists for managing properties in a generic or unified way.\n    - **Insight:** This implies that property updates might follow a different naming convention, or the updating mechanism might be embedded within other method functionalities.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Investigation\n\nGiven these insights, a few additional API calls could provide more context and potentially guide us toward a solution:\n\n1. **Explore Common Patterns or Classes Involved in Color Management:**\n    - This would involve looking at the implementation details of `set_color` in files where selectors or similar functionalities might be expected. We need to understand the context in which `set_color` is used and how it interacts with other parts of the code.\n    - Investigate more broadly for a class or a utility that handles properties related to graphics or UI elements, such as a Properties or Config class that isn't directly named \"Selector.\"\n\n2. **Dive into How Selectors or Similar Features Are Implemented:**\n    - Given the deprecation notices come from actions related to selectors, there might be a general migration path for handling UI element properties that hasn't been directly identified.\n    - **API Calls to Consider:**\n        - Given the wide usage of `set_color`, looking into one or two specific implementations might give clues. For example:\n            - `search_method_in_file(\"set_color\", \"lib/matplotlib/patches.py\")` or in any other file where selectors might be relevant.\n        - Search for usage or definitions related to properties management, which might not be as direct as `update` but could follow a similar function:\n            - `search_method(\"update\")` or\n            - `search_code(\"properties\")` to see how properties might generally be managed or updated.\n\nThese steps should help in understanding both the implementation details relevant to the reported issue and the proper way to handle the deprecation warning - either by identifying the right method to use or understanding how properties should now be managed within the project's architecture after the deprecation."

This approach preserves the ability to customize the appearance of selectors while respecting any new architectural or design changes introduced in Matplotlib or a related project like MNE. It's vital to ensure that the method not only sets the color but also updates any related properties or configurations in a way that's consistent with the updated design philosophy or API guidelines.\n\n     **Hypothetical Bug Location 2:** \n     - **File:** Since other related files host similar methods (`set_color`), a universal approach or utility function might be needed across multiple files.\n     - **Class & Method:** A universal or common utility class or function could be introduced or modified to handle the color setting for selectors across different components, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Introduce or update a method or utility function that acts as a central point for handling the color properties updates of selectors across all relevant classes. This method would encapsulate the new way of handling these color updates, possibly by internally managing property updates or by serving as a bridge to new APIs designed to handle such cases. This ensures that all parts of the project which need to update selector colors do so in a manner that's consistent and aligned with the latest project guidelines, thereby resolving the issue of deprecation warnings without losing functionality.\n"
