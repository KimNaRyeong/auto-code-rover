        "intended_behavior": "The method set_color in the Patch class should continue to work as it currently does, offering a way to simultaneously set the edge and face colors of the patch. To address the issue described, where there might be confusion or lack of direction due to deprecation warnings, the intended behavior extends beyond code modification. It should involve ensuring that any deprecations related to color setting on graphical selectors are clearly documented with pointed directions towards utilizing this set_color method as the preferred mechanism. If necessary, additional helper methods or clearer migration paths should be developed to facilitate easy transition and usage for users updating selector colors, without encountering deprecation warnings. This could include examples or utility functions that abstract the direct interactions with patch properties for more complex objects or selectors that are built on top of these patches, ensuring users understand how to adapt their code to the updated practices."
