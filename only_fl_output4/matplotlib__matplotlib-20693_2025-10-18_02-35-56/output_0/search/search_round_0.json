I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the information from the issue description, we will need to focus on retrieving more context about how selectors and their properties, specifically the color attribute, are handled within the MNE (assumedly related to Matplotlib based on the context). The issue mentions a deprecation warning without clear migration paths related to manipulating `selector` colors.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for the specific method or property updates mentioned in the issue. This will give us an idea of where and how such properties are generally handled or modified, especially in relation to selectors.\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")`\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rectprops.update\")`\n\n2. The user mentions a deprecation warning linked to some changes but doesn't specify which class or part of the project the `selector` is related to. Given that this seems like a significant functionality, we should look for mentions of selector-related classes to understand better where this functionality might be getting used or defined.\n   - `search_class(\"Selector\")`\n\n3. To address the potential workaround mentioned by the user (`selector.artists[0].set_color(color)`), we should look for any documentation or usage patterns related to this approach to see if it's supported or recommended.\n   - `search_code(\"selector.artists[0].set_color\")`\n\n4. Lastly, to understand any new or recommended methods for updating selector properties post the deprecation, we should look for any methods that might be used for setting properties or handling deprecations.\n   - `search_method(\"set_color\")`\n   - `search_method(\"update_props\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context on how selectors and their properties are manipulated within the project, which is crucial for drafting a proper patch."
