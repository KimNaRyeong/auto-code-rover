        "intended_behavior": "The `slugify` method should include an additional step for special handling of Unicode characters that change form in unexpected ways upon lowercasing (e.g., \"\u0130\" to \"i\u0307\") when `allow_unicode=True`. Before applying the existing transformations (normalization, regex substitutions, lowercasing), there should be a pre-processing step to explicitly map such special cases to their correct lowercase equivalents that do not introduce non-alphanumeric characters unrecognized by the `SlugField` validation. This ensures that for specific Unicode characters like the Turkish \"\u0130,\" their lowercase forms are directly converted to \"i\" (without the combining dot above), maintaining the original method's functionality while fixing the issue for Turkish and similar languages. This adjustment allows `SlugField` to validate slugs containing such characters without raising a `ValidationError`."
