I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\ntitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n# EUREKA!!\n('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong.\nThe \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\nU+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Page Class (`django/core/paginator.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Page` class from `django/core/paginator.py` is part of Django's pagination system, helping to manage splitting lists of items into individual pages. This class isn't directly related to the Page model in the issue, which describes a model used presumably for a website structure, indicating a potential misunderstanding or a need for further specification in the search criteria.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug?**\n  There's no direct relationship since the `Page` class found is for pagination and not for the web page modeling and slug generation issue described.\n\n- **Intended behavior?**\n  This part isn't relevant to the bug; therefore, the intended behavior analysis doesn't apply here.\n\n#### 2. Slugify Methods (`django/template/defaultfilters.py` & `django/utils/text.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `slugify` function converts strings into slugs, which are simplified versions of the strings that are web URL-friendly. Notably, there are two implementations; the second one in `django/utils/text.py` includes the `allow_unicode=True` parameter that directly pertains to the reported issue\u2014it converts characters to ASCII unless `allow_unicode` is set to `True`, after which it performs a series of normalizations, regex substitutions to eliminate non-alphanumeric characters, and a conversion to lowercase.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug?**\n  The described issue is directly related to the `slugify` function's inability to appropriately handle the Turkish \"\u0130\" when `allow_unicode=True`, leading to validation errors for slugs derived from strings containing this character. The cause is identified in the `slugify` method's handling of this character in lowercase conversion, which introduces a non-alphanumeric character ('COMBINING DOT ABOVE') that fails validation.\n\n- **Intended behavior?**\n  The intended behavior would ensure that strings containing \"\u0130\" are transformed into proper slugs that pass the `SlugField` validation even when `allow_unicode=True`. This implies a need to adjust the `slugify` method to handle such special cases correctly, potentially pre-processing characters like \"\u0130\" before the standard `slugify` logic or tweaking the lowercasing logic to anticipate and correct for the specific issue described.\n\n#### 3. SlugField Classes (`django/forms/fields.py` & `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `SlugField` class defines a model field type for storing slugs, supporting both unicode and ASCII characters based on the `allow_unicode` parameter. It applies slug validation through its default validators.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug?**\n  The class is relevant because the issue arises during its validation step, which fails for slugs generated from titles containing the Turkish \"\u0130.\" The bug originates from how slugs are produced (and thus inadvertently includes characters not recognized as valid by `SlugField`'s validators) rather than an issue within the `SlugField` itself.\n\n- **Intended behavior?**\n  The intended behavior of `SlugField` would allow it to store slugs derived from international characters, including the Turkish \"\u0130,\" when `allow_unicode` is enabled. This requires that the input slugs are properly sanitized and normalized, ensuring they meet the validation criteria.\n\n#### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe core of the issue lies in how `slugify` with `allow_unicode=True` handles specific Unicode characters such as \"\u0130,\" which when converted to lowercase, results in additional characters that fail `SlugField` validation checks. The problem isn't with Python's handling of `.lower()` itself but rather with the assumptions made in `slugify` about the outcomes of such conversions.\n\nA potential solution might involve enhancing the `slugify` method to specifically address the handling of Unicode characters that, when transformed to lowercase, result in additional characters not compatible with the expected slug format. This could be achieved by adjusting the order of operations or applying special case handling for known problematic characters.\n\nGiven the collected context, we might need further investigation or adjustments in the `slugify` method implementation in `django/utils/text.py`, ensuring that the transformation of international characters to slugs is both Unicode compliant and adherent to slug validation rules."

Before applying the existing transformations (normalization, regex substitutions, lowercasing), there should be a pre-processing step to explicitly map such special cases to their correct lowercase equivalents that do not introduce non-alphanumeric characters unrecognized by the `SlugField` validation. This ensures that for specific Unicode characters like the Turkish \"\u0130,\" their lowercase forms are directly converted to \"i\" (without the combining dot above), maintaining the original method's functionality while fixing the issue for Turkish and similar languages. This adjustment allows `SlugField` to validate slugs containing such characters without raising a `ValidationError`."
