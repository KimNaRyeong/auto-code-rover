This means that the user's umask doesn't work, e.g.:\n$ umask 077\n$ touch foo\n$ ls -l foo\n-rw------- 1 talex talex 0 2007-05-12 13:27 foo\n$ PYTHONPATH=trunk ./trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py startproject mysite\n$ ls -l mysite/settings.py \n-rw-r--r-- 1 talex talex 2804 2007-05-12 13:28 mysite/settings.py\nI discovered this whilst trying to make a Zero Install package for Django. Everything in the Zero Install cache is read-only, so startproject fails with:\n File \"/var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=262c95b5a7cc34f525408b675106e4e4ae3494cc/django/core/management.py\", line 799, in startproject\n\tfp = open(main_settings_file, 'w')\nIOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../site/settings.py'\nThanks,\n"

        "content": "To create a reproducer script for the described issue, consider the following steps in the script `reproducer.py`:\n\n1. Set the current umask to `077` to ensure newly created files are not readable, writable, or executable by group or others.\n2. Use Python's subprocess module to replicate the commands executed in the issue: First, using `touch` to create a file and check its permissions, and then simulating the Django `startproject` command to create a new project and observe the permissions of `settings.py`.\n3. Since the script is meant to simulate the issue related to the `django-admin.py startproject` command, it's important to take into account that setting up a full Django environment within the script might not be straightforward. This script instead focuses on the essence of the issue: file permissions against the user's umask settings.\n4. Capture if the permissions of the `settings.py` file (or any file created in a similar manner) respect the umask or if they are set to a more permissive setting, which should not happen according to the umask.\n\nThis script assumes:\n\n- You have a Django project or at least Django installed in your environment.\n- Python 3 is being used.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport stat\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef set_umask_and_check_file():\n    original_umask = os.umask(0o077)\n    try:\n        test_dir = \"testsite\"\n        test_file = os.path.join(test_dir, \"settings.py\")\n\n        # Ensuring the directory is removed before the test begins\n        if os.path.exists(test_dir):\n            subprocess.check_call(['rm', '-rf', test_dir])\n        \n        # Attempt to create a new Django project, which should include settings.py\n        subprocess.check_call(['django-admin', 'startproject', test_dir])\n        \n        if not os.path.exists(test_file):\n            raise AssertionError(\"Settings file was not created.\")\n\n        # Check file permissions\n        stat_result = os.stat(test_file)\n        file_permissions = stat.S_IMODE(stat_result.st_mode)\n        expected_permissions = 0o700  # Expected due to umask 077\n\n        if file_permissions & expected_permissions != expected_permissions:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"File permissions for {test_file} do not respect umask.

Ensure to run this in a suitable environment where this operation is safe.\n- It attempts to capture and assert the core issue: whether the file permissions of newly created files by Django's `startproject` ignore the current umask settings.\n- The script exits with code 0 if the issue is not present, indicating that the `settings.py` file's permissions align with the expected umask-applied permissions, and exits with code 1 if the issue is detected or if an unexpected error occurs."
