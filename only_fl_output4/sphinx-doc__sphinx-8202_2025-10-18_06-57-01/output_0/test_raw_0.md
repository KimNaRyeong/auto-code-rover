Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`, designed to replicate the described issue. This script attempts to recreate the specific scenario involving the inheritance of a generic class with doc comments, which is causing Sphinx documentation generation to fail. The script uses assertion to determine if the issue exists, printing a detailed stack trace if an error related to the issue is encountered. This script simplifies the reproduction of the issue outside of the full project and Sphinx documentation generation context.

Please note, the described issue is specific to Sphinx documentation generation and involves a warning produced during that process. Since this standalone script does not involve Sphinx directly, it simulates the scenario which could potentially cause Sphinx to emit the warning if it were processing this code's documentation. Thus, directly raising an `AssertionError` from within this script's context may not accurately reflect the reproduction of the issue as it does not interact with Sphinx. However, it creates a similar environment where the issue could be investigated further in relation to Sphinx documentation generation.
