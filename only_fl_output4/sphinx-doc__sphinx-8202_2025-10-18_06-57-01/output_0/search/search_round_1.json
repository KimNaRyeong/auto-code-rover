This could indicate a few possibilities:\n- The issue description might have presented a simplified or hypothetical example to illustrate the problem, rather than using the actual class names from the project.\n- The classes or code snippet may be dynamically generated or not directly defined in a way that the search API could locate them.\n\nTo proceed and gather more context, we need to adjust our strategy. Since direct searches didn't yield results, we might need to search more broadly. Potential steps could include:\n1. **Searching for files related to Sphinx documentation setup** in the project, as the problem occurs during Sphinx's HTML documentation generation process. Understanding how Sphinx is configured might shed light on why this warning is triggered.\n2. **Looking for any custom Sphinx extensions or configurations** used by the project that might influence how documentation is generated, specifically related to handling of generics or class attributes.\n\nGiven the above considerations, here are the next steps in API calls that could help us gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx configuration files or scripts within the project:** These files typically include `conf.py` for Sphinx or custom scripts used to generate documentation.\n   - `search_code(\"conf.py\")`\n   - `search_code(\"sphinx\")` to catch any custom Sphinx-related configurations or extensions possibly discussed in Python scripts or mentioned in documentation files.\n\n2. **Since the project might use custom naming or structures not directly mentioned in the provided issue,** searching for Sphinx extension usages or configuration snippets specifically mentioned in the issue can help identify relevant parts of the project.\n   - `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\")`\n   - `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autosummary\")`\n\nThese steps aim to locate the configuration and extension setup for Sphinx within the project, potentially leading to insights into the root cause of the documentation warning issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Given the lack of specific details found through the search API calls and the nature of the issue being about a Sphinx documentation generation warning related to generics and extending classes, it's not possible to precisely locate the bug without additional context or a broader understanding of the project's documentation setup. However, the issue seems to be more related to the Sphinx documentation configuration or how docstrings are handled rather than a specific location within the code.\n\nThe intended behavior at the location(s) that need to be fixed should ensure that:\n- Sphinx is able to properly parse and render documentation for generic classes and their subclasses.\n- Class attributes, especially those involving generics, are documented in a way that doesn't cause Sphinx to emit a warning about unexpected unindents or field list parsing issues. This might involve conforming to specific Sphinx syntax expectations or ensuring that any dynamic assignment of class attributes is clearly documented or annotated.\n\nWithout direct bug locations or more in-depth context from the project's source code, these intended behaviors are speculative and aimed at addressing the symptoms described in the issue (Sphinx warning about documentation formatting). Specific modifications might include adjusting the docstring format, reviewing the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`) for how autodoc settings are applied, or even providing additional directives or roles within the RST files that might circumvent the warning issue.\n\nTo proceed effectively, additional context would be required, either by broadening the search within the project to include documentation-related configurations and custom extensions or by directly inspecting the source to understand how generics are used and documented project-wide."
