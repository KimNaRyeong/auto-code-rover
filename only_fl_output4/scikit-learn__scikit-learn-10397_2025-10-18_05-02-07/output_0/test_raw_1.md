It appears that the error message you've encountered (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn.__check_build._check_build'`) indicates an issue with the scikit-learn installation rather than with the code provided earlier. This error typically occurs when the scikit-learn library is not installed properly.

However, assuming you want to proceed by checking the originally reported issue about integers in `RidgeCV` alphas causing a `ValueError`, here's how the script would look like. This script will execute correctly only if scikit-learn is properly installed:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    try:
        from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
        from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

        X, y = make_regression()
        # Attempt to fit RidgeCV with integer alphas
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        print("Success: No error was raised.")
    except Exception as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed." in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
        else:
            print("An unexpected error occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_issue()
```

This script will check whether the specific issue with RidgeCV's alphas being integers leads to a `ValueError`. It tries to fit a `RidgeCV` model with integer alpha values, which is expected to trigger the reported error. If the error occurs, it will print the stack trace, and if the issue has been fixed and no error occurs, it will simply print a success message.

Please ensure that scikit-learn is properly installed and built in your environment before running this script. If you continue to encounter installation-related issues, you might need to reinstall scikit-learn, potentially using a different installation method (e.g., using `pip` instead of a direct source installation or vice versa).
