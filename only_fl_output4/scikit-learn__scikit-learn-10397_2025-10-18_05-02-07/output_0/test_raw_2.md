Based on the directions provided, here is a `reproducer.py` Python script tailored to reproduce the issue described. This script will attempt to perform the operation that led to the ValueError, and it's structured to output a stack trace if the problem is present or exit successfully if the issue has been resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
        from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

        X, y = make_regression()
        # This line is expected to potentially raise the ValueError as described
        RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        # If the process gets here without an error, the issue is considered resolved
        print("No issue detected.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed." in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
        else:
            # If some other ValueError happens, it is unexpected
            print("An unexpected ValueError occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other unexpected exceptions
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To execute the script as specified, save it to the root directory of your project and run `python3 reproducer.py` from your command line. According to the instructions, the script should:
- Print a stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` if the specific issue (about handling integer alphas in `RidgeCV`) is detected.
- Exit with code 0 (indicating success) with a message saying "No issue detected." if the problem described does not occur, which means the issue has been fixed and no error is raised during the execution.

This script directly addresses the error handling and results expectations as you have outlined.
