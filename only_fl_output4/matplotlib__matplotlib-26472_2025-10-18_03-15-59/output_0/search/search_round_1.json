        "content": "<issue>Switching to inline backend closes GUI windows\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nWhen a plot is made with the `qt5` backend on and then the backend is changed to `inline`, the active plot window(s) are closed. This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\n- always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\n- use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure.\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\n```python\n# Paste your code here\n@contextmanager\ndef window(block=False):\n%matplotlib qt5\nplt.ioff()\nyield\nplt.show()\n# The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\nplt.ion()\n%matplotlib inline\nwith window():\nplt.plot([1, 3, 2])\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\n**Expected outcome**\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system:\n* Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\n* Python version: 3.7.3\n* Jupyter version (if applicable):\n```\njupyter                           1.0.0\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the results of the API calls provides us with a broad view across several aspects of the Matplotlib library, specifically focusing on its backend integration, the usage of context managers, and how figures are displayed. Let's dissect these findings in light of the provided issue.\n\n### `%matplotlib` Magic Command\n- **Location and Function**: The `%matplotlib` references are found in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`, and other instructional or example files. The presence in `pyplot.py` is particularly notable as this module is central to Matplotlib's plotting capabilities and likely where the magic is interpreted or has its effects proxied.\n- **Relation to Bug**: Since the issue involves switching backends with `%matplotlib` magic commands within a Jupyter Notebook, the findings in `pyplot.py` could lead us directly to where the backend switch happens and how it's handled.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, when switching backends using `%matplotlib`, the library should seamlessly transition from one backend to another without undesirably closing figure windows that were opened by the previous backend. There needs to be a mechanism that checks for and maintains opened GUI windows or provides a way to restore them.\n\n### Context Managers in Matplotlib\n- **Location and Function**: Context managers are found across various modules, including `backend_bases.py`, `animation.py`, and backend-specific modules like `_backend_tk.py` and `backend_webagg.py`. The presence in `backend_bases.py` suggests a generalized approach to handling resources or states that are common across backends.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The issue's desire is for a context manager that allows temporary switching to a GUI backend from an inline backend within a Notebook. The existing examples of context managers could provide insights into how Matplotlib handles resource and state management and how it could be leveraged or extended to accommodate the issue's requirements.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Within the context of the desired fix, a context manager should enable preserving the GUI window state or delaying the closure of GUI windows until the context is exited, even if the backend is switched back to `inline`.\n\n### `show` Method Implementations\n- **Location and Function**: The `show` method appears in various backend-related files, indicating its role in rendering or displaying figures. Each backend may have a tailored implementation, affecting how and when figures are displayed and managed.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The issue describes a GUI window that \"flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed\" upon switching back to the `inline` backend. This suggests that the `show` method or a related mechanism might be prematurely terminating the GUI window when the backend switches.\n- **Intended Behavior**: When `show` is called from a GUI backend context (e.g., `qt5`), the displayed GUI window should persist beyond the scope of the context manager or until explicitly closed, regardless of a backend switch to `inline`.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, the next logical steps could include:\n- **Deeper Dive into `pyplot.py`**: Look specifically at how `%matplotlib` is interpreted and actioned within `pyplot.py` to understand backend switching better.\n- **Explore Context Manager Implementations**: Specifically, those within `backend_bases.py` could offer clues on how backend states are managed and how extra functionality could be injected to preserve GUI windows.\n- **Review `show` Across Backends**: This involves particularly looking into `backend_qt.py` and comparing it to what happens in the inline or notebook backends like `backend_nbagg.py` to find discrepancies in figure management upon backend switching.\n\nThis multi-faceted approach, blending insights from backend management, context-specific handling, and figure display mechanisms, would ideally form a comprehensive understanding to guide the development of a solution to the reported issue."

This would likely involve adding a mechanism to \u201cremember\u201d or manage GUI backend state that can live alongside `inline` plotting without prematurely disposing of GUI windows.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`\n  - **Classes/Methods:** Context manager usage related to backend management. Specifically, any methods or constructor/destructors that manage the lifecycle of figures and backend states.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Introduce or adjust the existing context manager to allow for a temporary backend switch that does not close GUI windows upon exiting the context. This could include implementing a preservation state for GUI windows or delaying any `close` calls on figures created within a GUI context until the notebook session ends or the user explicitly closes them.\n\nThe intended behavior across these locations is designed to preserve current functionality (ensuring that backend switching remains seamless and non-disruptive) while introducing the flexibility to keep GUI windows open and interactive outside of the immediate scope in which they were created. This would effectively resolve the issue by allowing users to switch between `inline` and GUI backends without losing their work or being forced into less ideal workarounds."
