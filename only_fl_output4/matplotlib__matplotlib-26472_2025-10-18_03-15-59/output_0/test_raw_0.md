Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script designed to reproduce the issue described. The script utilizes a context manager to switch between `qt5` and `inline` matplotlib backends within a Jupyter-compatible environment. It attempts to create a plot window using the `qt5` backend and then switch back to the `inline` backend, expecting the `qt5` plot window to remain open. If the window closes as a result of switching back to `inline`, this script will raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from contextlib import contextmanager
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

@contextmanager
def window(block=False):
    plt.ion()  # Ensure interactive mode is on
    plt.clf()  # Clear the current figure
    try:
        plt.switch_backend('Qt5Agg')  # Switch to Qt5 backend
        yield
        plt.show(block=block)
        # Ensure the plot window has been created and is visible
        assert len(plt.get_fignums()) > 0, "Plot window should be open"

    finally:
        # Attempt to switch back to inline, expecting the Qt5 window to stay open
        plt.switch_backend('module://ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline')
        # Check if the Qt5 window remained open
        try:
            assert len(plt.get_fignums()) > 0, "Plot window closed unexpectedly"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)
        else:
            print("Test passed: Qt5 window remained open.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with window(block=True):
        plt.plot([1, 3, 2])
    # Exiting with code 0 indicates that we expect the issue to be resolved
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script assumes a Jupyter or IPython environment where `%matplotlib` magic functions are being used for backend switching. Since this script uses `plt.switch_backend` directly for a standalone Python environment, it may behave differently outside of Jupyter. Note that the original issue involves `%matplotlib inline` magic, which implicitly relies on Jupyter's handling of matplotlib backends. The assertion checks in this script are tailored to raise an error when the backend switch behaves unexpectedly, following the description of the reported issue.
