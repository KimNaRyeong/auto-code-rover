Here are the API calls I would make to gather this context:\n\n1. **Search for a class or method related to printing**: Since the issue mentions the need for printer support for matrices and arrays, there must be existing printing functionalities or classes that handle printing. I would search for classes or methods that indicate they are related to the printing process.\n\n   - `search_method(\"print\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Printer\")`\n   - `search_method(\"display\")`\n\n2. **Identify how data types are currently handled in printing**: Understanding how current data types are supported will provide a blueprint for adding matrices and arrays. This could involve searching for code related to data handling in printing classes or methods.\n\n   - `search_code(\"data type handling\")`\n\n3. **Look for any Mathematica-specific code handling**: Since Wolfram Mathematica has a unique way of dealing with data structures, it's important to identify any existing integration points or interfaces that handle Mathematica code or data structures.\n\n   - `search_code(\"Mathematica integration\")`\n   - `search_code(\"handle Mathematica data\")`\n\nThese searches should help in identifying existing structures, functionalities, and perhaps limitations or patterns in the codebase that would be relevant for implementing the requested support for matrices and arrays in Mathematica code."
