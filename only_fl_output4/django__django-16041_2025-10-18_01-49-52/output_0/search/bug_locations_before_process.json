        "intended_behavior": "Currently, the `empty_form` method explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True` for the form it returns. The issue arises when `form_kwargs` with `empty_permitted` specified are passed to formsets, impacting the `empty_form`. The intended behavior should ensure that `empty_form` behaves independently of `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` provided by users. This means adjusting the internal handling to either ignore `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` when creating `empty_form` or implementing logic to ensure that the explicit setting of `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs` does not affect or break the rendering of `empty_form`. This could involve modifying the way `empty_form` is instantiated to filter out `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` or setting it after instantiating the form with user-provided `form_kwargs`, ensuring it always remains `True` for `empty_form`."
