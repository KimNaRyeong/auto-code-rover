The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

Failed Searches\nThe search attempts for `sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py` and specifically for the `write_mo` method within that file didn't return results, indicating that either the file path provided in the issue is incorrect or the development environment's state at the time of the search doesn't include this file. This requires us to rethink our search strategy, possibly by looking for the `write_mo` function or its usage elsewhere in the codebase, or by checking other filenames or locations for i18n utilities in Sphinx.\n\n### Analysis of Configuration Parameter Addition Code\n\nThe snippets showing how configuration parameters are added within Sphinx extensions offer a good starting point for implementing a new configuration parameter such as `use_fuzzy_translations`. \n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThese snippets show how the `config.add` method is used to register new configuration parameters within Sphinx. Parameters like `'autosummary_context'` and `'autosummary_filename_map'` are added with their default values and additional attributes specifying whether they are rebuild triggers.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nThe issue requests the addition of a new `use_fuzzy_translations` configuration parameter. The examples provide a model for how to declare and initialize a new configuration setting in Sphinx, following established practices seen with other parameters. \n\n#### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior for the code involving the new configuration parameter is to conditionally include fuzzy translations in the generated `mo` files based on the value of this new parameter. This suggests that wherever the `write_mo` function is called, it needs to be adapted to consider this configurable setting.\n\n### Revised API Calls\nGiven the failed attempts to directly access the relevant file and method, and the insight gained from the configuration examples, there's a clear next step: to explore other locations or names for internationalization utilities and validate our understanding of where and how configuration parameters are applied in Sphinx. Here are some revised or additional API calls we could make:\n\n1. Since the direct path didn't work, try finding where the `write_mo` functionality could be defined or referenced, without relying on the specified file path:\n   - `search_method(\"write_mo\")`\n\n2. Understanding that configuration parameters are managed through `config.add` calls, we might also look into how these configurations are retrieved or checked at runtime, which could be relevant for implementing the usage of `use_fuzzy_translations`:\n   - `search_code(\"config.get_val\")`\n   - `search_code(\"config.values.get\")`\n\nThese steps are directed towards understanding the broader system of configuration management in Sphinx and locating the `write_mo` function, which is central to the issue at hand."

Since the exact file and method could not be located due to the provided filepath being incorrect or outdated, and without direct information on the `write_mo` method's current implementation, a precise bug location can't be concretely identified. However, based on the issue description, the intended behavior can be inferred:\n\n### Generalized Bug Location and Intended Behavior:\n\n- **File**: Given the issue description, it's clear that the modification should be in the file responsible for managing internationalization (i18n) utilities within Sphinx. A likely candidate would be within the `sphinx/util/i18n.py` or a similar file dedicated to i18n processes, based on Sphinx's standard file structuring. Since the precise file could not be found, the actual file needs identification.\n\n- **Class & Method**: The `write_mo` function is at the center of the issue. This function should have an additional parameter implemented to handle the conditional inclusion of fuzzy translations based on the new configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\nThe `write_mo` function, which is responsible for generating `mo` files from `po` files, should be modified to accept a new boolean parameter named `use_fuzzy_translations`. This parameter will determine whether entries marked as \"fuzzy\" in the `po` files should be included in the generated `mo` files. The default behavior (if the parameter is not provided or set to `False`) should be to exclude fuzzy translations, preserving backward compatibility and existing functionality. When `use_fuzzy_translations` is set to `True`, it should include the fuzzy translations in the output, catering to the new requirement.\n\nAdditionally, a new configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations` needs to be defined (presumably in a configuration management file or class within Sphinx where other such configurations are set up) which would be checked at the time of calling `write_mo` to decide whether to pass `True` or `False` based on the user's settings.\n\n**Note**: The information provided assumes familiarity with Sphinx's configuration system and internationalization process. To implement these changes accurately, locating the exact files and understanding the current implementation of the `write_mo` method and Sphinx's configuration handling is crucial."
