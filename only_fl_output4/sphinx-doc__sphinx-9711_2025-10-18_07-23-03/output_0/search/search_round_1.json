This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Since the issue revolves around Sphinx and its extension version check mechanism, we will look for relevant parts of the code where versions are compared. Specifically, we need to find where `needs_extensions` is handled or where extension versions are checked.\n\nLet's initiate the following API calls for gathering sufficient context:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that checks extension versions, as this is directly related to the issue. It's likely to be a method that handles the `needs_extensions` functionality or something similar.\n   \n   `search_method(\"needs_extensions\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions Sphinx version error, it's probable that the Sphinx configuration or initialization code might contain references to extension checks. Let's look for code that might explicitly mention version checking.\n\n   `search_code(\"sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery\")`\n\n3. Given that extension version checking is a common feature, there might be utility functions or methods designed to compare versions. Let's search for a generic version comparison function if it exists, as fixing the issue might require ensuring it's used correctly.\n\n   `search_method(\"compare_versions\")`\n\nThese calls should provide an overview of where the version comparison logic is applied and how extensions are checked against their required versions, pointing us towards the code segments that need adjustments to handle version comparisons properly."

Let's consider alternative approaches to locate where Sphinx handles extension version requirements and comparisons. Since the specific queries did not yield results, we should aim for broader terms and concepts related to the issue at hand.\n\n1. **Adjusting the search for `needs_extensions` method:** Since a direct method search for `needs_extensions` yielded no results, it's possible that the functionality related to checking extension versions doesn't reside in a method with that exact name. There might be a broader mechanism for handling extensions or their requirements.\n\n2. **Looking for Sphinx configuration handlers:** The issue involves Sphinx's initialization or setup process where it checks for extension versions. We should search for methods or code related to Sphinx configuration, setup, or bootstrapping, as these areas are likely to handle extension requirements.\n\n3. **General version comparison logic:** Our initial attempt to find a `compare_versions` method was unsuccessful. However, Sphinx must compare versions somehow, even if not through a method with that name. It might be helpful to search for version comparison logic embedded within methods related to extension handling.\n\nConsidering these adjustments, let's initiate a new set of API calls:\n- Search for code related to Sphinx's setup or initialization process that might interact with extensions.\n  `search_code(\"setup_extension\")`\n\n- Since the issue is with how versions are checked as strings, let's look for any code that explicitly mentions version checking in a broader sense.\n  `search_code(\"version\")`\n\n- Investigate the mechanism for registering or evaluating extensions, as this could lead us to the point where versions are compared.\n  `search_method(\"setup\")`\n  \n- Lastly, it might be useful to search for anything related to Sphinx's extension management to get closer to the source of the issue.\n  `search_code(\"extensions\")`\n\nThese adjusted searches aim to cast a wider net to capture the underlying mechanism that could be responsible for the described issue."
