This validation step should check if each email address is in a proper format. If any address is not valid, the function should raise a meaningful exception detailing the invalid format. This early validation should prevent runtime errors during email sending and make configuration errors more apparent to developers."

This validation should ensure that all addresses are correctly formatted, raising an exception if any are not. This addition aims to identify misconfigurations early and reduce runtime issues related to email delivery."
