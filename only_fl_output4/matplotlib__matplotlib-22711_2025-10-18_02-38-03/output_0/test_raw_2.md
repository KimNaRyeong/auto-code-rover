Given the requirements, I've prepared a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the reported issue in a structured way. This script includes the function `print_stacktrace` for outputting exceptions in a detailed format and attempts to create a RangeSlider widget with initial values, expecting to trigger an `IndexError` if the bug is present.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # Use TkAgg to ensure GUI elements work correctly in standalone scripts

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_range_slider_initialization():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.widgets import RangeSlider

    # Setting up a simple plot
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
    ax = plt.subplot()
    plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.25)

    # Defining the slider's position on the plot
    axcolor = 'lightgoldenrodyellow'
    axpos = plt.axes([0.25, 0.1, 0.65, 0.03], facecolor=axcolor)

    # Attempt to initialize the RangeSlider with specific initial values
    try:
        slider = RangeSlider(axpos, 'Test Slider', 0.1, 0.9, valinit=(0.3, 0.6))
        print("Initialization passed without raising an IndexError.")
    except IndexError as ie:
        print_stacktrace(ie)
        raise AssertionError("RangeSlider initialization raised an IndexError as reported.")

def main():
    try:
        test_range_slider_initialization()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("Test failed:", ae)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script targets the behavior reported as problematic by creating a `RangeSlider` with initialization parameters `valinit` set to a specific range. Here's how it works:

1. **Preparation and Setup:** The beginning part of the script imports necessary modules and sets up the Matplotlib backend. This is crucial for GUI elements like `RangeSlider` to work in a standalone script.

2. **The `print_stacktrace` Function:** Incorporated verbatim as requested, this function is designed to be called upon catching an exception. It iteratively prints a detailed traceback, helping diagnose the specific location and context of an error.

3. **The `test_range_slider_initialization` Function:** This portion sets up a minimal Matplotlib plot and attempts to instantiate a `RangeSlider` with specific `valinit` values. The goal is to recreate conditions under which the alleged bug occurs.

4. **Exception Handling:** If an `IndexError` is thrown during slider initialization, the script catches this, prints a detailed stack trace, and raises an AssertionError to indicate that the bug was successfully reproduced.

5. **Main Execution Logic:** The `main` function orchestrates the execution flow, calling `test_range_slider_initialization` and handling any AssertionError that arises. The script's exit code indicates the test outcome (0 for success, implying the issue could not be reproduced under the given conditions or has been resolved; 1 for failure, indicating the bug was reproduced). 

This script is laser-focused on reproducing the specific error reported with the RangeSlider. If the conditions under which the IndexError is raised have been accurately replicated in this script, and if the Matplotlib version used indeed contains the bug as reported, executing this script with Python 3 should unequivocally confirm the presence of the bug by raising an AssertionError. Conversely, successful execution without errors suggests either the absence of the bug under test conditions or its resolution in the utilized version of Matplotlib.
