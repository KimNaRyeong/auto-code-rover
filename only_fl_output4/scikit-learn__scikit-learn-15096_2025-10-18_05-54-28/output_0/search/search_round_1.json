I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

This finding narrows down where we should look into the source code to understand how it operates, especially in relation to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **Absence of the `fit` Method in `GridSearchCV`**:\n   - The inability to find the `fit` method directly within `GridSearchCV` suggests that this functionality might be inherited from a base class (`BaseSearchCV`) or the method's implementation does not directly match the search string due to dynamic or abstracted behavior. Given the nature of `GridSearchCV`, the `fit` method is crucial as it orchestrates the fitting of models across the provided parameter grid. Hence, not finding it directly means we may need to explore the base class or related classes/methods that contribute to this functionality.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `cv_results_['params']`**:\n   - The code snippets containing `cv_results_['params']` are spread across documentation and examples, including a couple of instances in the same file where `GridSearchCV` is defined. This code plays a central role in storing the parameters that were used for each iteration of model training within a grid search. Since the issue highlights that `cv_results_['params']` unexpectedly includes fitted estimators, leading to excessive memory use, we need to understand how and where this array is populated. The relationship to the bug is direct: if these entries erroneously hold references to fitted model instances, they would naturally inflate the memory footprint significantly.\n\nGiven the issue description and intended behavior, parts of the code that manipulate `cv_results_`\u2014especially those that assign values to `cv_results_['params']`\u2014should be scrutinizing estimators' parameters without retaining fitted models themselves. Ideally, parameters defining a model configuration should be saved in a manner that does not include large, fitted model objects unless explicitly intended.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context**:\n- Investigate the base class `BaseSearchCV` to find the `fit` method or any methods that lead to the population of `cv_results_['params']`.\n- Specifically, examine how `_search.py` handles the creation and updating of `cv_results_`, focusing on the process that could inadvertently store fitted models.\n\nAccordingly, we should perform the following API calls for more context:\n- search_class_in_file(\"BaseSearchCV\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"_run_search\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"cv_results_['params']\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")"
