I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

Since the issue revolves around `GridSearchCV`, we need to find where this class is defined in the codebase.\n2. Look into the implementation of how `cv_results_` array, specifically the `params` key within this array, is populated to understand why it saves fitted estimators.\n3. Inspect the cloning behavior of estimators during the grid search, possibly in the method that handles the fitting of these estimators, to see if estimators are properly cloned before being used.\n\nGiven this plan, let's start with the following API calls:\n\n1. search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n3. search_code(\"cv_results_['params']\")"
