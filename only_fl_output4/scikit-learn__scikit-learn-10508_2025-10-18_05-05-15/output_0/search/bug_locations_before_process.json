        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `transform` method to efficiently handle empty input arrays. Before executing its main logic (including type checking and `np.searchsorted`), the method should check if `y` is empty. If so, it should immediately return an empty array that matches the dtype found in `self.classes_`, ensuring consistency with the expected output format for different types of inputs. This adjustment should allow the `transform` method to handle empty lists gracefully, returning an empty array of the correct dtype without raising exceptions, thus preserving the existing functionality while resolving the reported issue."
