For an attribute or parameter initially set to `None` but annotated with a type hint (e.g., `a: str = None`), the UML diagram must display this as having the hinted type (e.g., `a : String`). This enhancement should preserve the ability to generate diagrams as currently done, adding the functionality to display type hints."
