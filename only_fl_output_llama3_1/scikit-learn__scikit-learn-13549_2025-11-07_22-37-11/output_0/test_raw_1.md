The issue is not with the code you provided, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. It seems that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce this issue, we can create a new Python script that tries to import scikit-learn and then fails because it's not installed correctly:

```py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue not fixed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script will fail to import scikit-learn and then print the stack trace.
