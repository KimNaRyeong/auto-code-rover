As the regression is mentioned to have occurred due to changes in a specific commit (0c0b87725bbcffca3bc3a7a2c649995695a5ae3b), we should first identify where and how the view name is determined and displayed in the debug pages. This involves looking into how the framework handles exceptions and generates debug information for 404 errors, particularly for CBVs.\n\nGiven the details, here's how we can structure our search:\n\n1. **Search for the CBV causing the issue**: Since the issue specifically mentions `view_tests.views.Http404View`, we can start by searching for this class to understand its implementation and any related exception handling.\n\n2. **Identify how the view name is captured and displayed**: We need to find where in the code the view name for the debug page is captured and formatted. This could involve looking into exception handling mechanisms or debug utilities that process and display error information in Django.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Http404View\")`: To find the definition of `Http404View` class.\n- `search_code(\"technical 404 debug page\")`: To find relevant code that handles the rendering or logic behind the technical 404 debug page, which might give us insights into where the view name is processed for display.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue's context and for further investigation."

Django typically uses reflection or meta-programming techniques for such tasks, which could involve getting the class name from class objects in a more general sense.\n\nLet's pivot our search strategy to focus on:\n1. How Django handles and formats class names for logging or debug purposes, particularly for CBVs.\n2.

        "content": "Given the unsuccessful attempts to directly find functions or snippets related to `format_exception`, `convert_class_name_to_view_name`, and generalized `exception handling` in the Django codebase, the results pointing towards `debug` in various files suggest a different approach for gathering context. Specifically, the mention of files relating to debugging and exception handling such as `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` indicates these could be key areas where the issue's root cause lies. \n\n### Analyzing the `debug` Search Results:\n\n**What these parts of the code do:**\n- Files under `django/template/...` are likely involved in rendering templates, which might include the rendering of debug information. However, these are less likely to directly affect the issue.\n- `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` are of particular interest. The former is probably directly involved in generating the debug pages (including the technical 404 debug page), while the latter might handle exceptions at a level that includes determining what information gets displayed on such debug pages.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n- The bug involves an incorrect display of class names on a technical 404 debug page. Therefore, any code responsible for capturing, formatting, or displaying information about views on debug pages could be relevant. Specifically, this includes how the fully qualified class names are converted into a more human-readable format without the explicit class syntax (`<class '...'>`).\n- `django/views/debug.py` could contain logic that formats the class representation for display, which might have regressed or been altered in the mentioned commit.\n- `django/core/handlers/exception.py` might be where exceptions are caught and processed for debug output, including determining which view or class name gets displayed.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Ideally, both `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` should handle class names in such a way that they are displayed in a human-readable format without the class syntax on debug pages. This would entail properly handling or parsing the class object's string representation to extract just the class name and possibly its module path without the extraneous symbols.\n- Adjustments or fixes in these areas should respect existing functionality, ensuring that any change made to improve the class name display for CBVs does not negatively impact other debug information displays.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the potential relevance of `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, more detailed examination of these files is warranted. Specifically, looking at where the debug information is formatted and where exception information is processed and displayed could yield insights into where the regression was introduced.\n\nRequired API Calls for Further Context:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"debug\", \"django/views/debug.py\")`: To closely inspect how debug information is formatted and displayed.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"exception\", \"django/core/handlers/exception.py\")`: To understand how exceptions are handled and how view or class names are prepared for display on debug pages.\n\nThese steps aim to narrow down the exact location in the code where the reported issue may be addressed by correcting how class names of CBVs are formatted on the technical 404 debug page."

Since I have not conducted the additional searches mentioned above due to the constraints of our interaction model, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis based on common practices and the details available from the initial issue description and the search results provided:\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors\n\n**Location 1:**\n- **File:** `django/views/debug.py`\n- **Class and Method:** This needs more specific identification through further search, but it is likely to be in a method that formats the view or class names for display. Ideally, a method that takes the class reference and prepares it for presentation in the debug output.\n- **Intended Behavior:** The correction here should ensure that when the debug page displays the name of a class-based view that has caused a 404, it should show the simplified class name (e.g., `view_tests.views.Http404View`) instead of the Python representation of the class object (`<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`). This likely involves parsing the class object's representation to extract or simplify the name in a more readable format. The modification should preserve all other debug information formatting functionalities.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- **File:** `django/core/handlers/exception.py`\n- **Class and Method:** Similar to `django/views/debug.py`, this requires specific identification. Look for methods involved in handling exceptions raised during the request-response cycle, especially those that might catch view-related exceptions for rendering on debug pages.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that during the exception handling process, when the responsible view (especially CBVs) is identified, its class name is properly formatted without the explicit Python class syntax. The code change should ensure that any logging or debug information retains full detail but improves readability regarding the naming of class-based views involved in exceptions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe intention behind the specified behaviors for both locations is to make debug outputs more intuitive and readable by presenting class-based view names in a conventional format, without the clutter of Python's class object syntax. These changes should not alter the fundamental way exceptions are logged or debug information is presented beyond improving the accuracy and readability of class-based view names."
