To resolve the issue, the code that triggers the `PytestDeprecationWarning` for old-style `hookimpl` usage within this file (or within the system that processes these hookspecs) should be enhanced. It should not only check for and warn about deprecated usage but also include information about the source of the deprecation (i.e., the plugin or file defining the deprecated hook). This enhancement might involve capturing the `__file__` attribute of the function or module when the `hookimpl` is registered and including that information in the warning message. Preserving Existing Functionality: The update should maintain all existing functionality surrounding hook registration and warning issuance. The primary change is to augment the warning message with location information, without affecting the registration or execution of hooks themselves."

Specifically, during the process where plugins are scanned for hook implementations, the system could be enhanced to record more detailed location information. When a deprecated `hookimpl` is found, the system should emit a `PytestDeprecationWarning` that includes this detailed location information, making it easier for users to identify and correct the source of the deprecation. Preserving Existing Functionality: The mechanism for loading, registering, and managing plugins and their hook implementations should remain untouched in terms of functionality. The enhancement should only extend the information provided in warnings related to deprecated hook usage."
