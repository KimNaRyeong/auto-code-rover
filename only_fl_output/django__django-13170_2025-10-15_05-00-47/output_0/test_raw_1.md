Based on your request and the need to correctly reproduce the issue with handling nested relations in `FilteredRelation`s condition, the following `reproducer.py` script is crafted to try and follow your guidelines more accurately, focusing on creating an assertion failure if the issue exists. It looks like there was a misunderstanding in processing the outcome previously.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django setup for script to run
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    USE_TZ=True,
)
django.setup()

# Models definition
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Pizza(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name='pizzas', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Topping(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name='toppings', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Reproduce the issue
try:
    query = Restaurant.objects.annotate(
        pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
            'pizzas__toppings',
            condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
        ),
    )
    # If the above line does not raise an exception, it means the issue is fixed
    print("The issue appears to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
except ValueError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is present and was reproduced successfully
```
This revised version aims to closely adhere to your instructions. After executing the test code within the django setup:

- If the issue exists, as described, the script will print the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` function and exit with code 1.
- If the issue is fixed and no exception is raised by Django (meaning nested relations in `FilteredRelation` conditions are supported), the script will print a message indicating the issue is fixed and exit with code 0.

Ensure your Django project's environment is set up correctly (i.e., Django is installed and the database is accessible) before running this script.
