For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

Since the description mentions improving the default name of merge migrations and includes an example filename `0003_merge_20160102_0304.py`, it suggests that there's a specific method or function responsible for generating these filenames within the migration system.\n\nTo get the necessary context for resolving this issue, we should look into the migration system, specifically focusing on how filenames for merge migrations are generated. The likely places to contain this logic could be within a class or method related to migration creation or handling. \n\nGiven this, the following API calls will help us locate the relevant code:\n\n1. **Search for a method that might be responsible for generating migration filenames**: Since the naming convention is specific, there might be a dedicated method for this. We can start by searching for any method that sounds like it could be responsible for this functionality. However, without explicit method names from the issue, we can guess common names related to the functionality.\n   \n   - `search_method(\"generate_migration_filename\")`\n   - `search_method(\"create_merge_filename\")`\n\n2. **Search for a class that handles migrations**: Migrations are a major part of any system that requires versioning of database schemas, so there is likely a class dedicated to handling these operations. From there, we can inspect methods related to merge migration naming.\n\n   - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationCreator\")`\n\n3. **Search for code snippets that might show how filenames are generated**: There might be specific lines of code where the filename is concatenated or formed. Searching for code snippets that involve filenames and merging could surface the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n   - `search_code(\"merge_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"_merge_\")`\n\nThese calls can provide a good starting point by highlighting the parts of the codebase that deal with migration naming, especially merge migrations. Once we locate the relevant methods or classes, we can delve deeper into the implementation details and plan out how to enhance the filename generation process based on the issue's suggestion."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, here\u2019s a breakdown and assessment based on the provided information and the questions suggested:\n\n### 1. Search results for classes and methods related to migration naming:\n\n- **No method named `generate_migration_filename` or `create_merge_filename` found**: This indicates that the functionality for naming merge migrations might not be encapsulated within a single, clearly named method or is perhaps named differently than anticipated. This suggests the need to explore parts of the codebase more directly involved with migration file handling or creation, specifically within the commands that handle making migrations.\n\n- **`Migration` class found in various files**: The multiple occurrences of the `Migration` class across different migration files within Django's own applications (e.g., `auth`, `admin`, `sessions`, etc.) likely represent individual migrations rather than the mechanism responsible for generating migration filenames. However, the presence of a `Migration` class within `django/db/migrations/migration.py` could be more relevant to the core migrations framework, including how migrations are defined or handled but may not directly relate to the naming of merge migration files.\n\n### 2. Relevant files and snippets containing `merge_` and `_merge_`:\n\n- The mention of `merge_` in various files, especially within `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`, is particularly promising. The `makemigrations` command is responsible for generating migration files based on changes detected in models. The references to `merge_` in this file likely pertain to how Django handles the creation of merge migration files, which is directly related to the issue.\n\n- The snippets containing `_merge_` within `django/db/models/query.py` might be less relevant to migration file naming and more concerned with query handling, given the context of the file\u2019s purpose.\n\n### Next Steps Based on the Analysis:\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most promising lead seems to be within the `makemigrations` command (`django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`). The references to `merge_` in this file are likely to be the closest to where the logic for naming merge migrations resides.\n\n#### To Further Understand the Related Part of the Code, We Should:\n\n1. **Examine the `makemigrations` command logic related to merge migrations**: This involves looking into how this command decides to create a merge migration and what logic is applied to determine the name of the migration file. This can help us understand the current mechanism and how it might be modified to include migration names more descriptively.\n\n2. **Inspect specific snippets within `makemigrations.py`**: Since this file likely contains the logic for naming merge migrations (as suggested by the presence of `merge_` references), viewing the specific snippets where `merge_` is mentioned would provide insights into the current naming conventions and where changes can be applied to implement the suggested improvements.\n\nGiven these points, the next logical steps would be to:\n- Request code around relevant snippets within `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` to identify the function or block that generates the filename for merge migrations.\n- Explore the `Migration` class in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` to a lesser extent, as understanding the structure of migrations might offer additional context for the naming convention, although the immediate focus should remain on the `makemigrations` command.\n\nHence, the next API calls should include:\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\", line_number, window_size)` for various relevant `line_number` values identified from the search of `merge_`.\n- Further examination of `django/db/migrations/migration.py` might not be immediately necessary unless the direct examination of `makemigrations.py` doesn\u2019t sufficiently clarify how merge migration filenames are generated."

However, the logic responsible for generating the filename for merge migrations resides in this file.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nTo resolve the issue, the code at the identified location(s) within `makemigrations.py` that generates filenames for merge migrations needs to be modified. The current behavior generates names based on a timestamp, producing filenames like `0003_merge_20160102_0304.py`. The intended behavior is to generate more descriptive filenames that reflect the migrations being merged. This can mean:\n- Combining the names (or specific identifiers) of the files being merged into the filename, for instance `0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py`.\n- Ensure that the new naming convention does not introduce issues with filename length limits on certain filesystems or compatibility issues within Django's migration system.\n- Preserve existing functionality for generating non-merge migration filenames to ensure that only merge migration naming logic is altered.\n- Incorporate a method to dynamically generate these filenames based on the migrations involved in the merge. This approach should consider the readability of the generated names and possibly include a logic to prevent excessively long filenames by abbreviating or summarizing the involved migrations when necessary.\n\nIncorporating this behavior would require modifying the existing methods or potentially adding new methods or logic within the relevant class in `makemigrations.py` to handle these naming conventions dynamically. The modification should additionally ensure that any change is compatible with existing Django migrations and does not disrupt the current workflow for Django developers."
