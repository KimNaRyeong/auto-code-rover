This means that if initial_strategy=\"constant\", the method should impute missing values using the specified fill_value, allowing for a custom initial imputation value rather than relying on hardcoded defaults. This should work seamlessly with both numerical and categorical data, and should also accept np.nan as a possible fill_value for compatibility with decision tree-based estimators as mentioned in the issue. The method's logic should verify the compatibility of fill_value with the data type being imputed to prevent type errors."
