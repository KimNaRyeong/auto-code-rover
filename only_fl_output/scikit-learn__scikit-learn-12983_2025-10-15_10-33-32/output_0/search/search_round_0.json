And apparently there was no test for the init parameter with other estimator than default.\n*Edit* Also accept initial estimator which does not support sample weights as long as the gradient boosting is not fitted with sample weights\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and eventually fix the issue involving gradient boosting failing with a scikit-learn estimator as the `init` parameter, and the additional points mentioned in the issue, we need to gather context about the Gradient Boosting implementation, particularly where it integrates with initial estimator logic. We should also look into how the `predict` method is implemented for these cases, and any relevant handling of sample weights.\n\nBased on this description, it seems pertinent to explore the implementation of the Gradient Boosting estimator, its use of an initial estimator, and how it handles predictions and sample weights. \n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"GradientBoostingClassifier\")` - This will help us find where the Gradient Boosting Classifier is implemented since the issue likely resides in or is closely related to this class. The issue could also potentially be in `GradientBoostingRegressor`, so we should search for that class if needed in a subsequent round.\n\n2. `search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")` - Similar to the classifier, we need to check if the regressor is affected by the same issue due to similarities in implementation.\n\n3. `search_method(\"predict\")` - Given that one of the reported problems is related to the `predict` output not having the expected shape, finding all definitions of this method could help us identify overrides or specific implementations within the gradient boosting logic that might be responsible for the issue.\n\n4. `search_code(\"init=\")` - This code snippet search could help us find instances where an `init` estimator is specified or managed within the codebase, potentially pinpointing where the logic fails when an sklearn estimator is used as the `init` parameter.\n\n5. `search_method(\"fit\")` - Since the issue mentions a condition related to fitting the model with sample weights and the handling of initial estimators that do not support sample weights, reviewing the `fit` method's implementations across relevant classes could offer insights into how sample weights are managed."
