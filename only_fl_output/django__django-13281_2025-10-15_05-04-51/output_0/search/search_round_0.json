It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

This will provide insights into how they are structured and any custom behavior that might be relevant to the cloning issue.\n- Next, investigate the `TestCase` where the issue is reproduced to understand how the Django testing framework is applied here, and any specifics about the setup or teardown that may influence the outcome.\n- Also, given the mention of a specific commit `bfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5`, it would be useful to retrieve code changes or discussions related to this commit, but since direct access to the commit is beyond the capabilities of the provided APIs, I will focus on examining `Model.copy` method or any similar method since the issue discussion reflects on ensuring deep-copy functionality, especially in the context of `_state` and `fields_cache`.\n- Lastly, review any implementation or reference to the `copy()` method or handling of `_state` and `fields_cache` in model instances, as understanding the existing approach can provide clues on how to implement or adjust the cloning mechanism for compatibility with Django 2.x.\n\nAPI calls to execute:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Bar\")`\n2. `search_class(\"Foo\")`\n3. `search_code(\"TestCase\")`\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Model\")`\n5. `search_code(\"_state\")`\n6. `search_code(\"fields_cache\")`"
