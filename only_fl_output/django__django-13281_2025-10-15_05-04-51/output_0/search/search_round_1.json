It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls yields the following insights:\n\n### Absence of `Bar` and `Foo` Models\nThe failure to find the `Bar` and `Foo` classes implies they might be specific to a project or test case not included in the broader, accessible Django framework code. This limits our ability to directly inspect how these models are defined and how they interact with Django's ORM and caching mechanisms. To proceed without this context, an understanding of Django's model behavior and how it handles foreign keys (`FK`) and instance copying is crucial, especially concerning any changes introduced in or after Django 2.0.\n\n### `TestCase` References\nThe presence of `TestCase` in multiple modules (`django/db/backends/base/creation.py`, `django/contrib/staticfiles/testing.py`, `django/contrib/admin/tests.py`, `django/core/management/commands/test.py`, `django/apps/registry.py`) underscores its widespread use for testing Django applications. While not directly related to the bug, it confirms the standard method of implementing tests in Django, which the provided test case follows. The issue might stem from how test cases handle model instances, particularly through caching and copying mechanisms that may have changed across versions.\n\n### Absence of `Model.copy` Method\nNot finding a `Model.copy` method suggests that copying model instances in Django might not have a dedicated method as part of the Django model API. This absence is particularly relevant given the issue's description, which involves cloning model instances. Django developers might need to use Python's standard copying mechanisms (`copy.copy` or `copy.deepcopy`) and be aware of their interactions with Django's model state management.\n\n### `_state` and `fields_cache` Usage\nThe presence of `_state` and `fields_cache` in numerous files, particularly `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, and others involved in Django's ORM layer, suggests these attributes play a crucial role in Django's internal state management for model instances. Changes to how these attributes are handled could affect how model instances are copied, especially regarding the integrity of foreign key relations and cache consistency across copied instances. The referenced commit (bfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5) may have altered the behavior of these attributes, potentially affecting model instance cloning.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\nWithout direct visibility into the models `Bar` and `Foo`, their specific test case, or the exact changes introduced by the discussed commit, the following additional steps could help gather more context:\n1. **Search for Changes in Django's ORM and Caching Mechanism:** This involves looking at Django's change logs, migration guides, or GitHub commit history around version 2.0, focusing on ORM, model instance management, and caching.\n   \n2. **Re-examine Model Instance Management:** Investigate how model instances are traditionally cloned in Django and whether guidance has changed between versions 1.11.x and 2.x. Specifically, understanding the recommendations around direct object copying versus using Django ORM functionality for cloning or recreating instances.\n\nGiven the insights from the current context, it seems the bug is deeply tied to the internal mechanics of Django's ORM layer, particularly how it manages model instance state and caching, and how these mechanics evolved in version 2.x. The intended behavior, from a developer's standpoint, would involve being able to clone model instances without unintended side effects on the original instance, especially in the context of FK relationships and cached values."

The code should ensure that when a model instance is copied (using Python's standard `copy.copy` or `copy.deepcopy`), all relevant state data, including foreign keys (`FK`) and caching mechanisms (`_state` and `fields_cache`), are correctly cloned. This includes the preservation of FK relationships and cache integrity so that changes to a cloned instance do not affect the original instance. This might involve examining or adjusting how `_state` (especially `fields_cache`) is copied between instances to ensure behavior consistent with versions < 2.0, thus preserving the expected functionality while also embracing any architectural changes introduced in Django 2.x.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Assess and possibly modify the handling of FK fields in the context of model instance copying. Since FK relationships are a central concern in the reported issue, ensure that any copying or cloning of model instances properly updates FK references in the newly created instance without inadvertently altering the original instance's state. This might require implementing deep copy logic specific to FK fields or enhancing how Django's model layer treats FK fields during any form of instance duplication.\n\nGiven the analysis and the lack of direct access to the specific commit or models (`Bar` and `Foo`), these locations are identified based on the involvement of model state management, fields caching, and relationship handling, all central to the reported issue. The adjusted or new behavior should ensure consistent and isolated behavior of cloned model instances across Django versions, mainly focusing on preserving FK relationships and cache integrity post-cloning."
