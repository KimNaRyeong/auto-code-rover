        "intended_behavior": "The part of the code responsible for handling model instance copying or state management needs to be updated or examined for Django versions >= 2.0. The code should ensure that when a model instance is copied (using Python's standard copy.copy or copy.deepcopy), all relevant state data, including foreign keys (FK) and caching mechanisms (_state and fields_cache), are correctly cloned. This includes the preservation of FK relationships and cache integrity so that changes to a cloned instance do not affect the original instance. This might involve examining or adjusting how _state (especially fields_cache) is copied between instances to ensure behavior consistent with versions < 2.0, thus preserving the expected functionality while also embracing any architectural changes introduced in Django 2.x."

        "intended_behavior": "Assess and possibly modify the handling of FK fields in the context of model instance copying. Since FK relationships are a central concern in the reported issue, ensure that any copying or cloning of model instances properly updates FK references in the newly created instance without inadvertently altering the original instance's state. This might require implementing deep copy logic specific to FK fields or enhancing how Django's model layer treats FK fields during any form of instance duplication."
