        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

This might indicate the checking functionality isn't encapsulated in a single class by that name or it might be a part of a larger module with a different naming convention.\n    - **Next Step**: Since the exact class name wasn't found, consider searching for files or methods more closely aligned with the functionality of link checking. The `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file seems promising as it contains methods named `check`, which could be directly related to this functionality.\n\n2. **Results from Searching `check` Method**:\n    - The `check` methods found within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` suggest this file is significant for link validation processes.\n    - **Next Step**: To further understand how `check` methods function and their parameters or logic, especially concerning handling different anchors, fetching these methods' implementations might provide insights into the issue. It would be beneficial to see how URLs and anchors are parsed and validated.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `anchor` in the Codebase**:\n    - The term `anchor` was found in various files, including `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` which stands out because of its direct relation to the issue at hand. This file had significantly more matches for `anchor` than others, implying an in-depth handling of anchors within link checking.\n    - **Next Step**: Drill down into `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` where the context of `anchor` could reveal how anchors are extracted, validated, and perhaps modified, which is central to the issue reported.\n\n4. **Occurrences of `fetch` in the Codebase**:\n    - Snippets containing `fetch` were found in files that may not directly relate to the issue except possibly `sphinx/ext/intersphinx.py`, which deals with intersphinx mappings and might include fetch operations for external links but might be tangentially related to our core issue.\n    - **Next Step**: It might be more productive to concentrate on how `fetch` operations are specifically handled within the context of link checking (`linkcheck.py`) rather than broader fetch functionalities across other modules.\n\nGiven these insights, we should focus on the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file for a deeper understanding of how the linkchecker handles HTML anchors specifically. It would be prudent to look at the implementation of the `check` method within this file, and also to explore how anchors are parsed, which seems to be at the crux of the reported issue.\n\nThe next API calls should, therefore, include:\n- Inspection of the `check` method implementations in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`.\n- Exploration of how anchors are managed in the same file, possibly through the mentions of `anchor` within the code context."

This implies the linkchecker logic should be robust enough to recognize and validate anchors in URLs regardless of whether they include the `user-content-` prefix or not. The existing functionality of checking links and anchors for correctness should be preserved while expanding its capability to understand and validate GitHub-specific anchor transformations. This could involve adding a pre-validation step or a normalization process for anchors before attempting to match them with targets in the checked document, ensuring compatibility with GitHub's anchor naming conventions without affecting its ability to validate other types of links and anchors."
