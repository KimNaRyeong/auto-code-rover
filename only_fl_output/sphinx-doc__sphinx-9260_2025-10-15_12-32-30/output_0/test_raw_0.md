Certainly, to address the specifics of reproducing the described issue with a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`, one needs to simulate the behavior of the Sphinx linkchecker, especially as it pertains to handling and verifying anchors in HTML documents derived from GitHub-rendered reStructuredText. The original issue suggests a discrepancy in how anchors are checked or interpreted by the tool.

Given the constraints and goals outlined, the `reproducer.py` script provided below attempts to mimic the actions of fetching an HTML page, parsing it to find specific anchors, and verifying their existence according to the behavior described in the issue. However, it's important to note that a complete replication of the Sphinx linkchecker's environment or internal logic might require more context or dependencies than provided in this simplified script. This script focuses on the core aspect of fetching and checking anchors in HTML to illustrate the issue.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def check_anchor(url, anchor):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch URL: {url}")

    page_content = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    anchor_tag = page_content.find(id=anchor)
    if anchor_tag is None:
        # Attempt to find using 'name' attribute for compatibility
        anchor_tag = page_content.find(attrs={"name": anchor})

    assert anchor_tag is not None, f"Anchor '{anchor}' not found in {url}"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Original anchor that worked previously
        check_anchor("https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst", "make-changes")
        
        # New anchor that works due to GitHub's rendering change
        check_anchor("https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst", "user-content-make-changes")
        
        print("Both anchors were successfully found.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

Remember, to execute this script, you'll need Python 3 and the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` packages installed in your environment. This script makes real HTTP requests to the specified URL and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and look for the specified anchors. If an anchor is not found, an `AssertionError` is raised, triggering the printing of the stack trace as requested.
