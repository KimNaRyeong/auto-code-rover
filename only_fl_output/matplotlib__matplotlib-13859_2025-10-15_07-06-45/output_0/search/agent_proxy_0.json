The error mentioned involves libpng, which indicates the problem occurs at the point of rendering or saving the figure as a PNG file. Given these considerations, here are the search API calls that would be most useful:\n\n1. Search for the method involved in saving a figure:\n   - `search_method(\"savefig\")`\n\n2. Search for the method or function that might be responsible for setting or adjusting figure size to see how zero-dimensions are handled:\n   - `search_method(\"subplots\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions libpng, it's useful to look for direct references to libpng within the matplotlib codebase, though this might be abstracted away:\n   - `search_code(\"libpng\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find relevant code snippets that deal with figure sizing and the saving process that relates to PNG output. The information from these searches will be critical for understanding how the dimensions are processed and potentially uncovering where the handling for zero-width figures might be missing or malfunctioning."
