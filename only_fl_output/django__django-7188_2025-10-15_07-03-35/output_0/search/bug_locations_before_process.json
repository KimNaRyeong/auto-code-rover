        "intended_behavior": "The middleware should ensure that it does not solely depend on django.contrib.auth being in INSTALLED_APPS for its operation. Initialization or access to auth-specific models and utilities should conditionally occur based on the availability of those models/utilities rather than the presence of the app in INSTALLED_APPS. This might involve dynamically importing the required components and handling their potential absence gracefully."

This might require introducing a softer check that verifies the availability of required authentication functionalities rather than the presence of the app itself, and offering guidance on how to manually ensure these functionalities are available when django.contrib.auth is not installed."
