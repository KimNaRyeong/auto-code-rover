        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that plots generated do not have overlapping labels. This could be achieved by introducing or updating existing logic that automatically adjusts label positioning based on the plot's dimensions and the length of the labels themselves. Preserve the functionality that allows for customizable and clear visualization of data across various plot kinds (`scatter`, `line`). Enhancements might include better default settings for label formatting that considers the plot's scale and density or improved interaction with matplotlib for dynamic label adjustments."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should guarantee that titles are set in a way that avoids overlapping with axis labels or tick marks, especially in dense plot arrangements or when using longer text labels. Potentially, introducing smarter handling of text size, positioning, and even auto-adjusting text wrapping or rotation based on space availability could be beneficial. All these should be done while maintaining the method's purpose of providing flexible, readable titles to the FacetGrid plots."
