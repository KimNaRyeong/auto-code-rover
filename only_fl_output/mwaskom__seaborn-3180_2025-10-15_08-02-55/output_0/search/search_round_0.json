        "content": "To gather sufficient context to resolve the issue related to overlapping labels in seaborn 0.12, I would require information on several key components of the seaborn library mentioned in the issue. Here are the specific API calls I would make:\n\n1. Since `relplot` is a high-level function in Seaborn, I need to understand how it is implemented. Hence, I'll search for the `relplot` method within the entire codebase.\n   \n   `search_method(\"relplot\")`\n\n2. The issue also mentions the use of `set_titles`, which is likely a method to configure plot titles. It's essential to see how it\u2019s implemented and interacts with plot elements, so I'll search for it too.\n   \n   `search_method(\"set_titles\")`\n\n3. The code snippet demonstrates a change in behavior regarding axes adjustments, suggesting something might have changed in how Seaborn handles axis labels or tick formatting in version 0.12. I would search for the `ticklabel_format` method to see if it's directly implemented or modified by seaborn.\n   \n   `search_method(\"ticklabel_format\")`\n\n4. Given seaborn\u2019s extensive use of matplotlib under the hood for plot rendering, it\u2019s important to inspect how the integration or customization for axis formatting and title setting is handled. Therefore, it might be beneficial to search for mentions of \"matplotlib\" within the code to understand direct invocations or custom integrations.\n   \n   `search_code(\"matplotlib\")`\n\nThrough these API calls, I aim to identify the implementation details of relevant methods and integrations that could be causing or influencing the issue of overlapping labels in Seaborn version 0.12. This information will be instrumental in crafting a patch to resolve the issue."
