This means, in addition to returning \"name\": self.name, it should also conditionally return \"violation_error_message\": self.violation_error_message if `self.violation_error_message` is not `None` (assuming `None` implies it's using the default message). This ensures that custom error messages are accurately preserved across migrations."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `__eq__` method to extend equality comparison to include `violation_error_message` in addition to other identifying attributes. This method should return `True` only if both the `name` and `violation_error_message` (and potentially other relevant attributes) of two `BaseConstraint` instances are equal. The `__eq__` method should have a signature like `def __eq__(self, other):` and include comparisons like: return (isinstance(other, self.__class__) and self.name == other.name and self.violation_error_message == other.violation_error_message). This implementation ensures that the constraint's uniqueness is properly evaluated, considering both its identifier and the custom error message, if any."
