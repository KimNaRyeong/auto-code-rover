        "intended_behavior": "The `write_mo` method should be updated to accept an additional parameter, `use_fuzzy_translations`. This parameter will control whether fuzzy entries are included in the `.mo` file generation process. The method must then leverage the Babel library's capability to handle fuzzy translations according to the value of this parameter. This adjustment allows users to choose whether fuzzy translations should be considered in their documentation, accommodating the need for a more flexible translation workflow."
