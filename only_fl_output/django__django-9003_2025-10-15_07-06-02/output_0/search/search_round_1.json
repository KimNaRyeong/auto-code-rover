But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The analysis of the search results provides some critical insights and drives next steps in investigation:\n\n### `combine` Method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\nThe discovery of two matches for the `combine` method within `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is particularly relevant. This file is part of Django's core Query construction, manipulation, and execution framework. The `combine` method is likely involved in combining different query expressions into a single SQL query, especially complex ones involving joins, unions, or conditions such as ORs, as mentioned in the issue. Given the issue description about non-deterministic crashes and assertion errors within `combine`, it's plausible that certain complex query patterns could be triggering an unanticipated state within this method, potentially due to mishandling of query transformation or combination logic.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nThe mentioned assertion error and the circular reference hint at a possible mishandling of dependencies between different parts of a query or incorrect bookkeeping of query transformations. This mismanagement could lead to a situation where the query's internal representation becomes inconsistent or malformed under certain conditions\u2014likely what the reporter is experiencing. The fact that this error is non-deterministic suggests that it might depend on factors like query execution order or the specific state of the database, which could affect the internal transformations `combine` is performing.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nIdeally, the `combine` method should gracefully handle all forms of query complexity, ensuring that queries are merged or combined in a way that maintains the integrity of their logical structure. The assertion is likely a safeguard against inconsistencies in the query transformation process; thus, the intended behavior would be to merge queries without introducing any circular references or other logical errors.\n\n### Could Not Find Class `Invoice`\nNot finding the `Invoice` class in the codebase is curious. This could imply that the class definition was overlooked by the search API or that the class is dynamically defined or modified in a way that makes it difficult to locate. Since the `Invoice` model is central to the user's issue, understanding its structure and relationships, specifically its many-to-many self-joins and conditions, is crucial for reproducing the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the direct relevance of the `combine` method found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to the reported issue, the next step should be to inspect this method's implementation to identify any potential sources of the non-determinism and the assertion failure discussed. Since we were unable to find the `Invoice` model directly, it might be worth exploring related models or querying mechanisms that could interact with it.\n\n#### Suggested API Calls\nTo further this analysis, focusing on `django/db/models/sql/query.py` where `combine` is defined would be prudent. Therefore, the next logical steps involve:\n1. Inspecting the implementation of `combine` to understand its logic, particularly around the management of `change_map` which seems central to the issue.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"combine\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`\n\n2. Given the inability to directly find the `Invoice` model, it might be useful to explore more generally how models are queried within the codebase, focusing on complex query patterns that could involve `combine` or similar mechanisms.\n   - This specific next step is less concrete without direct paths or method names to pursue related to `Invoice`. However, understanding how `combine` is used throughout the project could indirectly reveal typical patterns or elements of complex queries prone to the described issue."

The resolution should ensure that even when queries are combined in various orders or under different database states, `change_map` maintains a consistent and correct state. The assertion is designed to catch any inconsistencies early; therefore, the method's logic may need to be enhanced to prevent the creation of such states that lead to asserting failure. This enhancement could involve implementing a more robust mechanism for managing and verifying the integrity of changes made to queries as they are combined, ensuring no circular dependencies are introduced. The existing functionality of allowing queries to be combined to support complex data retrieval needs must be preserved while ensuring the process is error-free and deterministic."
