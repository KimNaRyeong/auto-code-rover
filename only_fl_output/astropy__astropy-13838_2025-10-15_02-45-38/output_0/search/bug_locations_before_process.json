        "intended_behavior": "The `_pformat_col_iter` method should explicitly handle cases where columns contain multidimensional arrays with dimensions of zero length. Specifically, when computing the formatted string for each element in a column, the function should check if the element is an empty array and if so, provide a meaningful representation rather than attempting to access elements within it\u2014which leads to the IndexError. A simplistic approach could be to immediately return a placeholder string (e.g., '`<empty array>`') if an empty array is detected. This approach preserves the method's functionality while ensuring that tables with cells containing empty arrays are handled gracefully, avoiding an unhandled exception."

        "method": "_pformat_col",
        "intended_behavior": "While the direct issue seems to arise within `_pformat_col_iter`, considering the stack trace and the overall formatting mechanism, it might also be prudent to ensure that `_pformat_col` accommodates or has safeguard checks for empty arrays before handing off to `_pformat_col_iter`. This means in the preparatory steps within `_pformat_col`, where it handles the column string iteration and eventual formatting logic, an initial check for empty arrays could be introduced, similarly returning a placeholder for cells with zero-length data. This enhancement ensures that even before iteration begins, the formatter is aware and capable of handling such arrays, thus contributing to a robust solution."
