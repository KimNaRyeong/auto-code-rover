        "intended_behavior": "This method is responsible for generating SQL for all indexes of a model, including field indexes, index_together, and Meta.indexes. The intended behavior here would be to extend this method or add a preliminary step to it that performs a check on the validity of model field names within functional indexes defined in Meta.indexes. This check should ensure that any expressions used within functional indexes refer to valid fields on the model. If invalid fields are detected, the system should raise an appropriate warning or error before proceeding with SQL generation. This validation step should be designed to only affect models with functional indexes, preserving the existing functionality for all other models and index types."
