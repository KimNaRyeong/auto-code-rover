This is not straightforward because resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError, so we cannot just collect columns from Query._gen_cols().\nFollow up to #26167.\nI attached tests.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding adding system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes, we should first understand the components and paths mentioned in the issue. The key terms and components mentioned are:\n\n- System checks for invalid model fields\n- Functional indexes in `Meta.indexes`\n- `Query._gen_cols()`\n- Reference to #26167, which might denote a previous issue or pull request that needs to be followed up.\n\nGiven these references, the following search API calls would be necessary to get an adequate context of where and how to implement the fix:\n\n1. Search for the system checks related to models and indexes. Usually, system checks involve a specific framework method or class, so identifying any existing system checks around models or indexes would be helpful:\n   - `search_method(\"check\")`\n   - `search_class(\"SystemCheck\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions `Meta.indexes` specifically related to functional indexes, which are a relatively new feature in databases and ORMs, finding where these are defined or handled in code would provide insight:\n   - `search_code(\"Meta.indexes\")`\n\n3. Understanding how `Query._gen_cols()` works, as resolving expressions without throwing `FieldError` is highlighted in the issue description. Since this is where the system presumably breaks due to invalid fields in expressions, getting context here is crucial:\n   - `search_method(\"Query._gen_cols\")`\n\n4. There's a mention of following up to `#26167`, implying that there was a related issue or change that this task is building upon or correcting. Finding this could give background on what was previously done and why further changes are now needed. If there are comments, commits, or documentation within the codebase regarding this, it might help:\n   - `search_code(\"#26167\")`\n\nThese calls aim to gather sufficient codebase context around defining and checking indexes, handling field names in those indexes, and any related system check mechanisms that enforce integrity or validations at the model level."
