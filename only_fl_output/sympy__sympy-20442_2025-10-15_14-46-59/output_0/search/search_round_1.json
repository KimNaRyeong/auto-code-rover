Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze the results:\n\n1. **`convert_to` Method Locations:**\n   - The `convert_to` method is identified in three different files within the codebase: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`, `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, and `sympy/polys/domainmatrix.py`. Given the nature of the reported issue, it is likely that the relevant implementation for this case would be found in either `quantities.py` or `util.py`, as those files seem to be related to physics units and their utilities, rather than polynomial domain matrices. Thus, we should focus our further exploration on these two files.\n\n2. **Joule and Second Classes:**\n   - The search did not find any classes directly named `Joule` or `Second`. This indicates that units like joules and seconds might be defined or handled in a more generic manner rather than through specific classes for each unit. This could point towards a system where units are managed through instances of a generic class, attributes, or in a database of known units without having dedicated classes for each.\n\n3. **Code Snippet Involving `joule*second`:**\n   - The snippet found involves setting a quantity scale factor for Planck's constant expressed as `6.62607015e-34*joule*second`. This shows that units like joules and seconds are indeed being manipulated programmatically in expressions, aligning with the nature of the issue at hand. It demonstrates how units are combined and potentially hints at the presence of a system for managing dimensional analysis within the physics module. This suggests that the handling of such unit operations is critical for ensuring correct physical constants and unit conversions throughout the library.\n\n**Further Steps for Context**:\n\n1. **Exploration of `convert_to` Implementations:**\n   - Given that the method appears in multiple locations relevant to units and their operations, a more detailed examination of its implementation in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py` is essential. These files are likely to contain the logic for handling unit conversions and might give us insights into the observed behavior concerning the unit conversion issue reported.\n\n2. **Understanding Unit Management:**\n   - Since specific classes for units were not found, gaining an understanding of how units are represented and manipulated in the library becomes vital. This could be achieved by further investigating the files where `convert_to` is defined, especially focusing on any unit-related data structures or mechanisms mentioned or utilized there.\n\nGiven the information and analysis above, the next set of API calls should aim to examine the `convert_to` function's implementation in `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py`, as these are likely to be directly related to the issue. Additionally, understanding the representation and management of units requires further investigation of the system for unit management, which might also be located in these files or closely related ones."

Specifically, converting joules multiplied by seconds (or any other units) to joules should not result in raising joules to a fractional power unless it is a physically meaningful conversion supported by well-defined rules. It should either return the original expression when no conversion is applicable, accurately convert between compatible units, or report that the conversion is not possible due to incompatible units.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sympy/physics/units/util.py\n  - **Class/Method:** Method `convert_to` (specific class context is needed after further investigation)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The utility version of `convert_to` should align with the specialized one in ensuring accurate and meaningful conversions between units. The method needs to account for complex unit expressions, ensuring that conversions maintain physical accuracy and mathematical integrity.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors assume that the functionality to be preserved includes accurate unit conversions across a variety of scenarios, supporting both simple and complex unit expressions without introducing errors or illogical results. Further detailed investigation through the proposed API calls is necessary to refine these locations and describe the precise changes required to resolve the issue."
