        "intended_behavior": "The `convert_to` function should correctly handle conversions between units, especially when dealing with units that involve operations such as multiplication or division. The correct behavior involves either: 1. Accurately converting between compatible units without reducing the expression to an unphysical or mathematically nonsensical form (e.g., `joule*second` should not simplify into `joule**(7/9)` without a valid physical justification). 2. When a direct conversion between the specified units is not possible or does not result in a simplification that preserves the physical meaning, the function should either return the original expression as is or clearly indicate that the conversion cannot be meaningfully performed. To fix the issue, the implementation needs to ensure it checks for the dimensional compatibility and physical validity of the conversion, perhaps incorporating a mechanism to flag or bypass conversions that would result in the kind of nonsensical simplification reported. This might involve refining the logic in handling complex unit expressions, ensuring it adheres to physical laws and the principles of dimensional analysis."
