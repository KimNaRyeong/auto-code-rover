This script defines a simple function `test_convert_to()` to reproduce the specified issue when executing the `convert_to` method with given units. The `AssertionError` should occur if the output does not match what is logically expected (either the unchanged input or a correctly converted unit, rather than an inappropriate conversion like `joule**(7/9)`). 

The `print_stacktrace` function captures and prints the stack trace for both assertion errors specific to the test case and other unexpected exceptions that could arise during execution. 

Make sure to have SymPy installed and up to date in your environment to properly execute this script. You may install or upgrade SymPy using pip:

```sh
pip install sympy --upgrade
```

Given the issue description, this script focuses on functionality available up to SymPy version 1.4 and aims to signify a failure point that might have been resolved in later versions.
