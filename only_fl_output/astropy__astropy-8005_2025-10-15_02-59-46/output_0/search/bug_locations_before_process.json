        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to modify how `T_cmb` is determined by ensuring it reflects the current default cosmology's `Tcmb0` value, rather than hardcoding it to `Planck15.Tcmb0`. This change preserves the existing functionality by still providing a default cosmological temperature but ensures the source of this default value is consistent with the project's overall approach to cosmological defaults. The modification should include a fetch mechanism for the current default cosmology (similar to how the `H0` equivalency intended to work) and use its `Tcmb0` value if `T_cmb` is not provided by the user."
