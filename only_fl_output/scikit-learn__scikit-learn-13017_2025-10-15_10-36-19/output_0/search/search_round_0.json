        "content": "To investigate the issue related to the `ColumnTransformer` behavior when negative index values are passed, we need more context on how `ColumnTransformer` and possibly associated methods like `fit_transform` handle column indices. Let's proceed with the following API calls to understand the implementation and any related logic:\n\n1. Search for the `ColumnTransformer` class in the codebase to get an overview and the file it is defined in.\n2. Once we have the file path, we can look into how it processes column indexes, specifically for methods that would be involved in interpreting those indexes during transformers' fitting and transforming stages.\n\nHence, the first step is to locate the `ColumnTransformer` class and then proceed from there:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")\n```"
