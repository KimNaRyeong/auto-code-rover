        "intended_behavior": "The `_iter` method should be enhanced to correctly handle negative column indices by translating them to their positive counterparts, based on the width of the input dataset `X`. This involves determining the actual index a negative number points to before any transformer is applied. Before iterating over the transformers to apply them, the method should check if any column indices are negative. If so, it should convert these negative indices to their corresponding positive indices (considering the total number of columns in `X`). This conversion should occur early in the method, before transformers are applied, ensuring that both negative and positive indices would effectively point to the same columns. This behavior should strictly follow Python's negative indexing conventions, meaning that a column index of `-1` should refer to the last column, `-2` to the second last, and so forth. This adjustment should not interfere with any existing functionalities for handling column indices that are positive, callable selectors, or mask-based selections. The alteration should ensure that, regardless of the indexing style, the transformers are applied to the correct columns, thereby preserving the intended functionality of applying specified transformers to designated columns while maintaining the rest of the `ColumnTransformer`'s behavior."
