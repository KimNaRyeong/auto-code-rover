        "intended_behavior": "The `two_sum` function should reliably compute the sum of two floating-point numbers (`a` and `b`) and their floating-point error in such a way that `two_sum(a, b)` is equal to `two_sum(b, a)`, even for very large or disparate values of `a` and `b`. This function is intended to minimize floating-point arithmetic errors and should be implemented to ensure that its outcome is not dependent on the order of the operands. To fix the issue, the implementation may need to be reviewed and possibly refined to ensure that it handles extreme cases of floating-point arithmetic more robustly, maintaining symmetry in the results regardless of operand order. This may involve further investigation into the floating-point error compensation technique used and possibly incorporating additional precision-enhancing techniques for cases that could lead to discrepancies due to the order of operands."
