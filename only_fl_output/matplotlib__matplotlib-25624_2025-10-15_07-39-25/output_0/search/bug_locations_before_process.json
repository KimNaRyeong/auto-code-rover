This adjustment ensures that there is no silent failure or unexpected behavior when users attempt to use `tight_layout` with `figure.autolayout` set to `True`. The existing functionality of automatically adjusting the layout when `autolayout` is enabled should be preserved, but an additional check or mechanism should be added to respect or acknowledge `tight_layout` kwargs when also used."

        "intended_behavior": "Any method or function within this file that reads or modifies the `figure.autolayout` setting needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles situations where both `autolayout` and `tight_layout` are used. If `tight_layout` is called, the code should respect the explicit user request to adjust layout parameters manually, which may involve temporarily disabling `autolayout` or merging the settings with `tight_layout` kwargs. The balance between automatic and manual layout adjustments needs to be clear to users, either through documentation or runtime messages."
