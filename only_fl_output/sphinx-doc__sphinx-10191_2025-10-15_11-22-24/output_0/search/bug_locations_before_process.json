This may involve ensuring that footnote references are correctly recognized and linked to their definitions within the LaTeX output. The class might require modifications or additional handling logic to specifically cater to the scenario where multiple references to a single footnote are made, ensuring consistency in rendering and hyperlink functionality."

The intended behavior here would be to adjust or refine these transformations to ensure that explicitly numbered footnotes and their subsequent references are correctly transformed into LaTeX syntax that preserves hyperlinks and display properties. This could involve fixing or improving the logic that translates Sphinx footnote syntax into LaTeX commands that are recognized and correctly processed by LaTeX compilers."
