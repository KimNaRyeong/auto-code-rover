        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of footnotes being incorrectly rendered as `?` in the PDF output of a Sphinx document, we need to assess how Sphinx handles footnotes in the document-to-latex conversion process. Given the information about the bug and the Sphinx version specified, it would be sensible to explore how footnotes are processed within the Sphinx codebase, especially how explicit footnote references are parsed and converted into LaTeX. We should focus on classes or methods related to the LaTeX builder, or those handling reStructuredText parsing, especially as it pertains to footnotes.\n\nTherefore, our first steps will involve searching for the relevant classes and methods involved in this process. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LaTeXBuilder\")`: Since the issue occurs during the `make latexpdf` process, it's likely that the `LaTeXBuilder` class or its equivalents handle the conversion of footnotes for LaTeX output.\n\n2. `search_method(\"write_footnotes\")`: This method name is speculative but represents what we would expect to be involved in processing footnotes for any output, including LaTeX.\n\n3. `search_code(\"footnote\")`: Since we're not entirely sure how footnotes are specifically handled, searching the codebase for instances of \"footnote\" might reveal functions, method calls, or other relevant snippets that are involved in the process.\n\nThese API calls are aimed to provide a broad overview of the mechanisms Sphinx employs to handle footnotes and their references, especially focusing on the generation of LaTeX documents. With the insights gained from these calls, we should be able to identify relevant code paths and further investigate the cause of the bug."
