Below is a standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the issue described. This script programmatically generates the RST file, then attempts to build a PDF using Sphinx. If the footnotes are not rendered correctly, it should raise an `AssertionError`. This is assuming you have Sphinx and the necessary environment set up for building PDF documents from RST files (e.g., having LaTeX installed).

Please note, this script has a dependency on Sphinx, and it assumes that Sphinx is properly installed in your environment. If you run into any issues related to Sphinx dependencies, please ensure Sphinx is installed and correctly configured to build PDF documents.

    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script checks the generated PDF for the presence of "?" in places where footnotes should be, which indicates the reported issue is present. For a more accurate check, depending on how the text is extracted from the PDF, you might need to refine the `check_pdf_output` function, as text extraction from PDFs can sometimes be unreliable or format-specific.

**Important:**
- This script requires `PyPDF2` for checking the PDF contents. Ensure it's installed in your environment (`pip install PyPDF2`).
- The presence of LaTeX is required for Sphinx to build PDFs. If you encounter errors related to PDF generation, please ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed and properly configured.
- Adjust paths and commands as necessary to fit your environment and dependencies.
