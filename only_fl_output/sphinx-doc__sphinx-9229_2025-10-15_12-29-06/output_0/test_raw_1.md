Given the requirements and the prior challenge encountered during execution due to Sphinx not being found in the environment, it seems clear that we need a different approach that can be used across different environments without assuming specific tool availability. Thus, the revised `reproducer.py` below attempts to manually parse the generated HTML files for expected docstrings, bypassing the need for direct Sphinx invocation which may fail if Sphinx isn't installed globally or within the current Python environment.

This approach leverages direct file manipulation and HTML parsing to verify the presence of docstrings in the generated HTML. It implies that the Sphinx documentation needs to be generated ahead of running this script.

```python
import os
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def check_docstrings_in_html(file_path, expected_docstrings):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as html_file:
        contents = html_file.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(contents, 'html.parser')

    for docstring in expected_docstrings:
        if docstring not in str(soup):
            raise AssertionError(f"Docstring \"{docstring}\" not found in HTML")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # You should specify the exact path of the generated HTML file to check
    # For instance, if `file.py` is documented within a Sphinx project,
    # and `make html` is run, find `file.html` in the `_build/html` directory
    path_to_html = 'path/to/_build/html/file.html'
    
    expected_docstrings = [
        "Dictionary with PyScaffold's options",
        "When the file content is `None`",
        "Signature of functions considered file operations"
    ]

    try:
        if not os.path.exists(path_to_html):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The specified path does not exist: {path_to_html}")

        check_docstrings_in_html(path_to_html, expected_docstrings)
        print("All type alias docstrings are correctly documented.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before running this script, ensure you have:
- Generated Sphinx documentation for your project containing the `file.py`.
- Installed BeautifulSoup4 in your environment (`pip install beautifulsoup4`).

This script abstracts away from directly creating and configuring a Sphinx project and focuses on verifying the documentation output's content. It is important to update the `path_to_html` variable to point to the actual location of the generated HTML file you wish to verify.
