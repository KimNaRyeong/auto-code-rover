        "intended_behavior": "The Sphinx `conf.py` file may need adjustments to ensure it properly handles and documents type alias definitions. This would include making sure that the Sphinx `autodoc` extension is correctly configured to handle type aliases. The intended behavior here is to ensure that `autodoc` consistently processes and renders the documentation for all type aliases, reflecting their descriptions in the generated HTML without defaulting to \"alias of ...\" text unless that is explicitly desired. The configuration might need to include or adjust settings that are specifically related to type treatment, such as `autodoc_typehints` and ensuring that custom setup steps do not inadvertently interfere with the documentation generation for type aliases. Modifications in `conf.py` could also involve ensuring that any Sphinx plugins or extensions that could potentially filter out or modify the docstrings (e.g., the used `cut_lines` function) are correctly configured to preserve type alias documentation."
