Given the requirements and the constraints mentioned, to accurately reproduce the mentioned Sphinx issue, we need to understand that directly reproducing the Sphinx parsing mechanism outside of Sphinx itself might be challenging due to its complex parsing and extensibility features. However, assuming we are looking to trigger the specific error related to Sphinx's inability to parse the `**` operator in function signatures, here is an updated approach that focuses on trying to simulate the Sphinx environment more closely without directly importing Sphinx components that caused the ModuleNotFoundError due to missing dependencies like `docutils`.

This time, we'll take a slightly different approach since directly importing and using Sphinx components led to issues. Instead of trying to replicate the internal workings of Sphinx, the updated script will still aim to setup a minimal Sphinx project programmatically and then invoke Sphinx via a subprocess. This approach should closely mimic a real Sphinx run and avoid directly running into dependency issues within the script itself.

Please make sure you have Sphinx and `docutils` installed in your environment. If they are not installed, you can install them using pip before running the script:

```sh
pip install sphinx docutils
```

Here is the updated `reproducer.py` script:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_directory():
    import os
    if not os.path.exists('test_project'):
        os.makedirs('test_project')
    with open('test_project/conf.py', 'w') as conf:
        conf.write("extensions = []\n")
    with open('test_project/index.rst', 'w') as index:
        index.write(".. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n.. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n")

def run_sphinx_build():
    setup_sphinx_directory()
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'test_project', 'test_project/_build'], text=True, capture_output=True, check=True)
        if "Unable to parse BinOp object" in result.stderr:
            print("Issue present.")
            raise AssertionError("Failed to parse arglist containing expressions.")
        else:
            print("No parsing issue detected.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nSphinx build failed.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sphinx_build()
```

This script accomplishes the following:
- Sets up a minimal Sphinx project with an `index.rst` file that includes the problematic Python method signatures.
- Runs the Sphinx build process using the `subprocess` module to catch any stderr output specifically looking for the "Unable to parse BinOp object" warning.
- If the specified warning appears in the stderr, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the presence of the issue.
- If the build succeeds without the specific warning, it indicates that the issue is not present.

Before running the script, ensure Sphinx and its dependencies are correctly installed in your environment. This script does not directly invoke Python Sphinx APIs which should circumvent the direct dependency issues encountered in the first attempt, but relies on having Sphinx suitably installed and accessible in your environment's path.
