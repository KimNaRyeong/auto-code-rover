        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Analyzing `JSONField` in `django/forms/fields.py`\n\nThis `JSONField` is a subclass of `CharField` and is designed to handle JSON data in forms. It defines methods such as `to_python`, `bound_data`, `prepare_value`, and `has_changed`, each contributing to the field's behavior from initialization to data processing and validation.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe bug report specifically mentions a `TypeError` that occurs when a form with a `JSONField` is rendered with no data (\"not NoneType\"). The error points towards the handling of `None` or non-existent data. Looking at the implementation of `bound_data`:\n- It's clear that this method attempts to return parsed JSON from the data if it's not disabled and falls back to `InvalidJSONInput(data)` upon failure.\n- The bug likely manifests because this method does not handle `None` data gracefully before attempting `json.loads(data, cls=self.decoder)`, which raises a `TypeError` if `data` is `None`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description and the intended use case of allowing a `JSONField` to be optional (`required=False`), the intended behavior of the `bound_data` method should probably include handling `None` data without raising an exception. Ideally, it should return `None` or some form of \"empty\" indicator compatible with JSON expectations (such as `None` or an empty dictionary `{}`) if the input data is `None`.\n\n### Failed Search for `form = JSONForm({})`\n\nThis attempt was to find instances of form creation with an empty `JSONField`, which could help understand how such forms are typically handled or initialized in the codebase. The failure to find such code suggests either that it\u2019s not a common pattern represented straightforwardly or that our search might need refinement (e.g., looking for more generic instantiations of forms that might not explicitly use `JSONForm`).\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\n\nTo better understand how forms and specifically `JSONField` are expected to handle `None` or empty input, additional API calls could be oriented around:\n- How forms are typically instantiated (`Form` class constructors).\n- Other methods in `JSONField` that deal with validation or initialization (`__init__`, `to_python`, `prepare_value`).\n- General error handling in `JSONField` to see if there's a pattern that `bound_data` should follow.\n\nGiven the current findings, a likely patch could involve updating the `bound_data` method to check if `data` is `None` and, in that case, either return `None`, `{}`, or pass it through `decoder` if provided, aligning with the handling logic for other types of input. To suggest such a patch specifically, however, more context about form initialization and how other fields manage similar scenarios would be beneficial."

Bug Location:\n   - File: `django/forms/fields.py`\n   - Class: `JSONField`\n   - Method: `bound_data`\n\nIntended Behavior:\nThe `bound_data` method needs to be modified to handle the case where `data` is `None`. Given that `JSONField` might be optional and may not always receive data, especially in cases where the form is rendered with initial values being `None`, the method should not attempt to parse `None` as JSON. Instead, it should return `None` or a default value that signifies no data was provided.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality:\n- Before attempting to load the data using `json.loads`, the method should check if `data` is `None`.\n- If `data` is indeed `None`, return `None` directly, bypassing the `json.loads` call. This prevents the `TypeError` while ensuring that optional `JSONField` usage does not break form rendering.\n- This change allows `JSONField` to still accept and properly handle actual JSON data, including empty JSON objects or arrays, while correctly interpreting a lack of data (`None`) as a valid state, thus not raising an exception."
