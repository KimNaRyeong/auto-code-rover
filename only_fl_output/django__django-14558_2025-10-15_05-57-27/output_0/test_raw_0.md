Ensure you have Django and the `psycopg2` library installed, and you're set up to run Django scripts. This script attempts to simulate the described issue. The `AssertionError` will be raised if the `TypeError` described in the issue is encountered, confirming the issue's presence. It will print a stack trace for any encountered exception for easier debugging. If no exceptions occur, it indicates the issue may have been resolved, and it exits with code 0.
