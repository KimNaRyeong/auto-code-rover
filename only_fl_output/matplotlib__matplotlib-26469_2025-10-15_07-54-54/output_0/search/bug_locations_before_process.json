If 'keep_empty' is 'False' and no figures have been added ('_n_figures > 0' is 'False'), the file creation/open statement ('open(self._output_name, 'wb').close()') should be skipped to avoid generating an empty file. This change will need to consider the LaTeX handling specifics but ensure empty files are not unnecessarily created."
