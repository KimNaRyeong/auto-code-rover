        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nChange PdfPages to default to keep_empty=False and eventually deprecate keep_empty\nPdfPages has an option, `keep_empty`, that sets whether a PdfPages object with *zero* figures is written to the disk at all or not.  This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

        "content": "Given your instructions to correct the approach for simulating and catching the outlined issue in the `PdfPages` functionality of changing `keep_empty` to default to `False`, I will modify the previous approach. The core issue revolves around `PdfPages` producing or not producing an empty PDF file based on the `keep_empty` flag. The existing default behavior (considered problematic) is when `keep_empty` is implicitly set to `True`, allowing an empty PDF to be created. The goal, following your issue description, is to change this default to `False`, and hence, not generate an empty PDF. This script will simulate the issue by explicitly setting `keep_empty=True`, which should mimic the current problematic behavior, and then it will check the existence of the file, expecting failure as the desired state is not to produce such files by default.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    # Set the path for the PDF to be generated\n    pdf_path = \"/tmp/test_empty_pdf.pdf\"\n\n    # Create a PdfPages object with keep_empty=True to simulate the issue\n    try:\n        with PdfPages(pdf_path, keep_empty=True) as pdf:\n            pass  # No figures added intentionally\n\n        # After the PdfPages context manager ends, check if the PDF exists\n        if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):\n            # If the file does not exist, it means behavior has changed successfully\n            print(\"PdfPages did not create an empty file with keep_empty=True, as it should.\")\n            sys.exit(0)  # Issue fixed, exit with code 0\n        else:\n            # The test should fail if the empty PDF file was created\n            raise AssertionError(\"PdfPages created an empty file with keep_empty=True, issue persists.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # If any other exception occurs, report it and exit with error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        main()\n    except AssertionError as ae:\n        print_stacktrace(ae)\n        # Exiting with code 0 as this block is expected to catch AssertionError when the issue persists\n        sys.exit(0) \n```\n\nThis script will test if the problematic behavior persists by explicitly setting `keep_empty=True` and attempting to create an empty PDF. If the PDF is created, it confirms the issue is still present by raising and catching an `AssertionError`, thus validating the scenario you're concerned with. The script's exit code indicates whether the issue was reproduced (`0`) or if an unexpected error occurred (`1`)."
