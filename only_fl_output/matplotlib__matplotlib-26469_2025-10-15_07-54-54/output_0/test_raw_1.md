Given your instructions to correct the approach for simulating and catching the outlined issue in the `PdfPages` functionality of changing `keep_empty` to default to `False`, I will modify the previous approach. The core issue revolves around `PdfPages` producing or not producing an empty PDF file based on the `keep_empty` flag. The existing default behavior (considered problematic) is when `keep_empty` is implicitly set to `True`, allowing an empty PDF to be created. The goal, following your issue description, is to change this default to `False`, and hence, not generate an empty PDF. This script will simulate the issue by explicitly setting `keep_empty=True`, which should mimic the current problematic behavior, and then it will check the existence of the file, expecting failure as the desired state is not to produce such files by default.

```python
import os
import sys
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Set the path for the PDF to be generated
    pdf_path = "/tmp/test_empty_pdf.pdf"

    # Create a PdfPages object with keep_empty=True to simulate the issue
    try:
        with PdfPages(pdf_path, keep_empty=True) as pdf:
            pass  # No figures added intentionally

        # After the PdfPages context manager ends, check if the PDF exists
        if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):
            # If the file does not exist, it means behavior has changed successfully
            print("PdfPages did not create an empty file with keep_empty=True, as it should.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Issue fixed, exit with code 0
        else:
            # The test should fail if the empty PDF file was created
            raise AssertionError("PdfPages created an empty file with keep_empty=True, issue persists.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # If any other exception occurs, report it and exit with error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        # Exiting with code 0 as this block is expected to catch AssertionError when the issue persists
        sys.exit(0) 
```

This script will test if the problematic behavior persists by explicitly setting `keep_empty=True` and attempting to create an empty PDF. If the PDF is created, it confirms the issue is still present by raising and catching an `AssertionError`, thus validating the scenario you're concerned with. The script's exit code indicates whether the issue was reproduced (`0`) or if an unexpected error occurred (`1`).
