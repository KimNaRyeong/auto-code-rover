        "intended_behavior": "In `pyplot.py`, adjustments should be made to ensure that backend switching via `%matplotlib` magic does not interfere with the visibility of GUI windows created under different backends. Specifically, this involves preserving the state of GUI windows upon backend switches. Methods related to backend switching and interactive mode toggling (`ion()`, `ioff()`) may need to be modified to check the current backend and manage GUI windows accordingly, without closing them unintentionally. The exact implementation would depend on identifying a method to tag certain figures to remain unaffected by backend changes or maintaining a global state of figures that should not be closed upon backend switches."

        "intended_behavior": "This file, which is likely involved in the fundamental implementation of display mechanisms across backends, may require modifications to the `show()` method implementations specific to different backends. The adjustments should ensure that figures designated to remain open (perhaps through a mechanism introduced in `pyplot.py`) are not closed when the backend switches to `inline`. This could involve enhancing the `show()` method or related utility functions to acknowledge the new state management logic introduced in `pyplot.py` for backend switching, maintaining the figure's visibility as needed."
