        "content": "<issue>Switching to inline backend closes GUI windows\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nWhen a plot is made with the `qt5` backend on and then the backend is changed to `inline`, the active plot window(s) are closed. This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\n- always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\n- use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure.\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\n```python\n# Paste your code here\n@contextmanager\ndef window(block=False):\n%matplotlib qt5\nplt.ioff()\nyield\nplt.show()\n# The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\nplt.ion()\n%matplotlib inline\nwith window():\nplt.plot([1, 3, 2])\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\n**Expected outcome**\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system:\n* Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\n* Python version: 3.7.3\n* Jupyter version (if applicable):\n```\njupyter                           1.0.0\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue, we need detailed information about how backends are switched in Matplotlib, especially within a Jupyter Notebook context, and how plotting is handled. The context manager described in the issue involves making calls to switch Matplotlib's backend to `qt5` for GUI interaction and then back to `inline` for inline plotting in a Jupyter Notebook. Understanding the mechanisms of backend switching and plot displaying will be critical. \n\nI will perform the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the code responsible for handling the `%matplotlib` magic command, as this is crucial for backend switching in Jupyter Notebooks.\n2. Search for anything related to the handling of `plt.show()` as its behavior seems to be central to the issue, specifically how it interacts with different backends.\n3. Investigate how `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()` (interactive mode on and off) are implemented and used, as these are mentioned in the code snippet provided in the issue.\n\nGiven these requirements, the API calls I'll invoke are:\n\n- `search_code(\"%matplotlib\")`: Since `%matplotlib` is a magic command unique to IPython/Jupyter environments, this will help find how the project handles or interacts with this command, particularly in the context of backend switching.\n  \n- `search_method(\"show\")`: This will help us understand the `plt.show()` method's behavior across different backends, which seems crucial for this issue.\n\n- `search_code(\"ion()\")`: To understand how enabling/disabling interactive mode is handled in the codebase.\n\n- `search_code(\"ioff()\")`: Similarly, this will help understand how the codebase manages turning the interactive mode off, which could impact the GUI window's persistence."
