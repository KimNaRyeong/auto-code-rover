Given the clarification and the goal of creating a script that would raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and exit cleanly when the issue is fixed, please see the adapted `reproducer.py` script below. This version aims to directly test the behavior of the issue by checking for figure presence before and after the backend switch, under the constraints that it executes in a headless testing environment and does not rely on GUI interactions.

```python
"""
reproducer.py

This script is designed to be executed in an environment where matplotlib is installed.
It attempts to reproduce the issue described, where switching matplotlib backends
from 'qt5agg' to 'inline' closes the GUI window.

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"

# Early check for backend availability
if 'qt5agg' not in matplotlib.rcsetup.all_backends:

    sys.exit(0)

def reproduce_issue():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Step 1: Switch to Qt5Agg backend and generate a plot
    matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg')
    fig = plt.figure()
    plt.plot([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0])  # Sample plot
    plt.draw()  # Necessary to render the figure in some environments

    # Check for figure existence (this might not accurately reflect GUI window status but is an indirect check)
    initial_fig_count = len(plt.get_fignums())

    # Step 2: Switch back to inline backend and check figures
    matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Using 'Agg' as a stand-in for 'inline' in scriptable test

    # Verify the figure status after backend switch
    final_fig_count = len(plt.get_fignums())

    # Expectation: The figure count should not change if figures are preserved post-backend switch
    if initial_fig_count != final_fig_count:
        raise AssertionError("Figure was closed after switching the backend")

try:
    reproduce_issue()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 indicating the issue is present.
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for any other exceptions.
else:
    # Exit with code 0 when the issue doesn't occur, indicating potential fix or inability to reproduce in this setup.
    sys.exit(0)
```

Please be aware this script takes a conservative approach to simulating the issue without actual GUI windows, given the headless nature of many testing environments. While it uses the presence and count of figure numbers as a proxy to check if figures were closed upon backend switching, this might not fully capture the nuanced behavior experienced in an interactive setting with GUI backends. Nonetheless, it adheres to the specified constraint, attempting error exit codes and stack trace outputs based on encountered AssertionError or other exceptions.
