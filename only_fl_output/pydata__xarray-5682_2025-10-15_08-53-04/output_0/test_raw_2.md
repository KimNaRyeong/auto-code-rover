Based on your requirements and the detailed instructions provided, here's how a Python script named `reproducer.py` could be structured to adhere to your specifications. This script aims to reproduce the issue mentioned and consists of logic to assert whether the complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s are rendered correctly when plotting with `xarray`. If the script encounters the issue, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. If the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0, signaling that the problem does not occur anymore.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr

    # Creating a DataArray with a complex LaTeX expression in long_name
    da = xr.DataArray(range(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=range(5)))
    complex_latex_name = r"$Ra_s = \mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k) / \mu M^2_\infty$"
    da.x.attrs["long_name"] = complex_latex_name
    
    # Attempt to plot the DataArray
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    da.plot(ax=ax)
    
    # Checking if the xlabel is set to the complex LaTeX expression
    try:
        assert ax.get_xlabel() == complex_latex_name, "LaTeX expression was not rendered correctly."
        plt.close(fig)  # Close the figure window if there's no exception
    except AssertionError as e:
        plt.close(fig)  # Ensure we close the figure window before printing the stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Use SystemExit(1) to indicate failure

    print("Issue not present, LaTeX expression rendered correctly.")
    SystemExit(0)  # Use SystemExit(0) to indicate success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```
This script focuses on the specific issue mentioned regarding the rendering of complex LaTeX expressions in plot labels using `xarray`. The structured approach allows for clear identification of whether the issue persists. Ensure that your Python environment has the necessary dependencies installed (`matplotlib`, `xarray`, and their dependencies) and is configured correctly for generating and displaying plots.
