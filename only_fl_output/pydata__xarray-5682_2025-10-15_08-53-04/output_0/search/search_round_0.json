        "content": "To address the issue of complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s not rendering correctly when plotting with xarray, we need more context about how xarray handles LaTeX rendering and its interaction with matplotlib. Here are the specific API calls to make:\n\n1. Search for how xarray uses `plot` by investigating where `plot()` is defined for DataArray objects:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"plot\", \"DataArray\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a difference in rendering when plotting directly with matplotlib's `xlabel()`, we need to understand how xarray applies labels to plots. This involves looking at any custom logic around setting axis labels, especially for complex LaTeX expressions:\n   - `search_code(\"xlabel\")`\n   - `search_code(\"long_name\")`\n\n3. It could be helpful to see if xarray delegates LaTeX rendering to matplotlib in a special way, or if there are known limitations or conditions for this feature:\n   - `search_code(\"latex\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of where the problem might originate and guide the next steps towards a solution."
