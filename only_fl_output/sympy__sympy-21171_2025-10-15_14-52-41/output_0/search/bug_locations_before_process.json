        "intended_behavior": "Modify `_print_SingularityFunction` to properly handle or ignore unexpected keyword arguments like `exp`. If the method signature does not currently support an `exp` argument, it should either be updated to manage this argument appropriately (if it's relevant to the rendering of a `SingularityFunction` in LaTeX) or to ensure it doesn't fail when an unexpected argument is passed. The fix should maintain the ability of `_print_SingularityFunction` to render `SingularityFunction` objects accurately in LaTeX, with or without handling specific keyword arguments that may inform the rendering process, like specifying the exponentiation part of the function in LaTeX format."
