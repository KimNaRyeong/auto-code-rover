        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the various search results gives us insights into the components mentioned in the issue and their potential relationship to the bug described:\n\n### 1. ExpressionWrapper in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n\n- **What it does:** `ExpressionWrapper` encapsulates an expression and an explicit output field. It is used to annotate or compute new field values based on database-side calculations without necessarily altering the database schema.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue describes a problem where `ExpressionWrapper` loses its `output_field` in combined expressions without an explicitly set `output_field`. Given the use of `ExpressionWrapper` for the division and the average computation in the user's query, its operation and initialization are directly relevant.\n- **Intended behavior:** When initialized with an `expression` and an `output_field`, `ExpressionWrapper` should maintain that `output_field` throughout the query processing, ensuring the annotated field type aligns with expectations.\n\n### 2. Field Classes: `IntegerField`, `AutoField`, `FloatField`\n\n- **What they do:** These classes define types of fields that can be used in Django models. `IntegerField` and `FloatField` represent integer and floating-point numbers, respectively, while `AutoField` is typically used for automatically incremented primary keys.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The exception points to a conflict between `IntegerField` and `AutoField` detected during output field resolution. `FloatField` is mentioned as the explicit `output_field` in one of the `ExpressionWrapper` uses, indicating its relevance in type casting or expectations in the resulting expressions.\n- **Intended behavior:** These field types should be correctly interpreted and inferred in expressions, particularly when used in `ExpressionWrapper`. When explicit `output_field` is provided, Django should not throw errors regarding mixed types unless user error is evident, ensuring expected behavior as seen in previous Django versions.\n\n### 3. `select_format` and `_resolve_output_field` methods\n\n- **What they do:** These methods likely play roles in determining how expressions are formatted for SQL queries (`select_format`) and resolving the output field of expressions (`_resolve_output_field`).\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The traceback implicates both methods in the failure, suggesting an issue in either the formulation of SQL select statements with respect to field types or the resolution of output field types from given expressions.\n- **Intended behavior:** `select_format` should correctly form SQL fragments that reflect the desired computations and types, and `_resolve_output_field` should accurately determine the resultant field type from expressions, especially when mixed field types or complex expressions are involved.\n\n### 4. Aggregate Functions: `Avg` and `Sum`\n\n- **What they do:** These aggregate functions compute average and sum, respectively, of given fields over defined groups of data.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Although it is not clear how `Avg` directly relates to the issue since `Sum` is used in the problematic query, both classes showcase the framework's capabilities in dealing with numerical computations. The usage context in the issue doesn't leverage `Avg` directly, but misunderstanding between the two might lead to confusion.\n- **Intended behavior:** When used within an expression involving `ExpressionWrapper`, these functions should contribute to accurately computing the specified aggregates without type conflicts, assuming correct usage and explicit definitions where necessary.\n\nBased on these analyses, the next steps could involve investigating how Django's ORM constructs and executes SQL from expressions involving different field types, especially regarding the handling and inference of output fields in complex expressions. This would necessitate deep dives into the source code for `select_format`, `_resolve_output_field`, and the initialization and application of `ExpressionWrapper`, ensuring that explicit `output_field` specifications are respected and correctly applied."

The resolution process should account for mixed types (e.g., `IntegerField` and `AutoField`) by providing a sensible default `output_field` type (like `FloatField` for division operations) or by improving error messaging to guide the user in explicitly setting an appropriate `output_field` when automatic resolution is not possible. The approach should preserve compatibility with expressions where the output type can be clearly inferred.\n\n2. **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n   - **Class:** `ExpressionWrapper`\n   - **Method:** `__init__`\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior:** This constructor should include enhanced validation or inference logic to handle or anticipate cases where the `output_field` might need more clarification due to the combined use of different field types. If automatic resolution of `output_field` is feasible based on common patterns (e.g., arithmetic operations between integer fields defaulting to a float output), such logic could be incorporated. Alternatively, if resolution is not straightforward, improved guidance for the developer on the need to explicitly declare an `output_field` in complex scenarios could be provided. This would ensure that developers have a clear path toward resolving type ambiguities in complex expressions, retaining the intended versatility of `ExpressionWrapper` for a wide array of use cases.\n\nThese fixes aim to address the issue's core while maintaining the flexibility and functionality of Django's ORM layer, as demonstrated by previous versions' behavior as expected by the user. The focus is on enhancing type resolution within expressions and providing clearer guidance or automatic handling for cases that currently lead to errors due to mixed or ambiguous type definitions."
