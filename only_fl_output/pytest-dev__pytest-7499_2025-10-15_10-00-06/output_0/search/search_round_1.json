        "content": "Based on the search results, we have identified that methods with the name `raises` are located within two files in the pytest codebase: `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` and `src/_pytest/python_api.py`. Given the context of the issue, which revolves around the behavior of `pytest.raises` especially in relation to matching error messages, our primary focus should be the `src/_pytest/python_api.py` file. This is because `test_excinfo.py` is likely related to unit tests for pytest functionality, while `python_api.py` likely contains the actual implementation of the `pytest.raises` method, among other utility methods for Python-based testing.\n\n### Analysis Goals\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `pytest.raises` method is designed to provide a context manager that checks for a specific exception to be raised within a block of code. It optionally allows for matching a specific error message or pattern. Understanding its implementation detail will reveal how it compares the exception message with the `match` parameter value, handling special cases such as regular expressions or plain string comparisons.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The issue reports confusion when the expected pattern (a plain string in this particular case) exactly matches the exception message, but pytest still fails the test indicating a mismatch. This suggests a potential issue or oversight in how the `match` parameter's handling is implemented in `raises`. Specifically, how it interprets plain strings, possibly mishandling cases involving special characters like parentheses.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   Ideally, the `raises` method should accurately compare the error message against the match pattern, recognizing cases when an exact string is provided (not a regex pattern) and handling special characters appropriately. Additionally, if a potential common mistake is identified (such as not realizing a plain string is being treated as a regex), it could benefit from improved error messaging or warnings to guide the user towards the correct usage.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven these analysis goals, we need to inspect the implementation of `pytest.raises` in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` more closely. This involves looking at how it handles the `match` parameter and how it compares this parameter with the actual exception message. Insights into these mechanics will help identify the cause of the reported issue and suggest possible resolutions.\n\nTo move forward, an appropriate next step would be to fetch the implementation details of `raises` within `src/_pytest/python_api.py`. This can be achieved by retrieving code snippets from the file where `raises` is implemented:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"raises\", \"src/_pytest/python_api.py\")`\n\nThis will provide specific insights into its logic, particularly how match patterns are processed and compared against caught exceptions' messages."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Furthermore, when a `match` parameter is provided, the method should accurately match the exception message against the specified pattern. The issue arises in the interpretation or comparison process of the `match` parameter against the raised exception's message, especially when the match string contains characters that have special meanings in regular expressions (like parentheses).\n\n   To resolve the issue, the intended behavior of the `raises` method should be extended or refined to:\n   - Explicitly check if the `match` parameter is intended as a plain string or a regular expression. This could be inferred from the presence of regex special characters or potentially through an additional parameter specifying the match type.\n   - Enhance error messages or warnings when a potential misunderstanding in string vs regex usage could lead to confusing outcomes, as noted in the bug report. Specifically, it should guide the user towards escaping special characters if they intend to use a plain string that includes such characters.\n   - Preserve existing functionality for matching and asserting exception raises, ensuring that any modifications do not disrupt current user expectations for both plain string matches and regular expression matches.\n\nThis approach aims to mitigate the confusion and improve user experience without compromising the flexibility and power of `pytest.raises` for advanced matching scenarios."
