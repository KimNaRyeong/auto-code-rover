See below:\n# Test with matched Queryset. Sum will return 50\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>>{'test': 50}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset. Sum will return 0\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test':0}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset (using empty list). EmptyResultSet returned because of empty list. Sum will return NONE\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test': None}\nSimon Charette on django-users suggested the following:\nFrom what I understand the ORM simply doesn't perform any query in this case\nas the pk__in lookup cannot match any OrderItem and result in an\nEmptyResultSet exception[1].\nThis exception is caught in the Query.get_aggregation() method where all\naggregates are converted to None[2].\nI suppose we should alter the except EmptyResultSet clause to account for\nouter_query.annotation_select items that are Coalesce() instances used with\nValue() but I'm unsure about how it should be done.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L221-L223\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L439-L445\nSee full discussion here:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/HGD3Vv3IerA\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue described, we need to start by gathering relevant code context from the Django project. Based on the issue description, we need information about the handling of `EmptyResultSet` in aggregate queries, especially in scenarios involving `Coalesce` and `Value` functions when used with an empty list for `__in` lookups.\n\n1. First, let's examine the `EmptyResultSet` exception and its implementation. The issue description references its occurrence in lookups, so we'll start by locating this class to understand how it's raised.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"EmptyResultSet\")\n   ```\n\n2. Next, we need to explore how `EmptyResultSet` is handled within the aggregation query processing. Specifically, we're interested in the `Query.get_aggregation()` method, as mentioned in the issue description.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_aggregation\", \"Query\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue description also references a particular code block where `EmptyResultSet` exceptions are caught and aggregates are converted to `None`, we should look directly at this logic. Although we have a rough idea of the file and method from the issue (`Query.get_aggregation()`), locating the exact code that catches `EmptyResultSet` will clarify the current behavior and what might need to be changed.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"except EmptyResultSet\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, understanding how `Coalesce()` and `Value()` are used within the aggregate method might also be beneficial, especially to grasp this issue's impact. Since `Coalesce` might be a central function in aggregates that fails due to the described behavior, let's locate its implementation for a start. Then, seeing it within the context of `get_aggregation` might require adjusting the strategy based on what we find initially.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Coalesce\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how `EmptyResultSet` exceptions are managed during aggregation queries and how this behavior impacts the use of `Coalesce` with `Value` in such queries."
