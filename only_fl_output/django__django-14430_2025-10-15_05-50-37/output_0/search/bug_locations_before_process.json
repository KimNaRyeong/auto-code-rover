        "intended_behavior": "The method should account for scenarios where an 'EmptyResultSet' would result from the query conditions (such as an empty list provided to 'pk__in'). In these cases, even when no actual rows are returned by the underlying query, any aggregation functions wrapped with 'Coalesce' that include a 'Value' fallback should return this fallback value instead of 'None'. This ensures that 'Coalesce' functions consistently, irrespective of whether the queryset is empty due to an optimization like 'EmptyResultSet'. Modify or extend handling within 'get_aggregation' or closely related methods to: Detect when an aggregate function involves 'Coalesce' with a 'Value' fallback. Override the default behavior that would return 'None' for an empty result set, returning the specified fallback value instead. Ensure that this change does not affect the general handling of 'EmptyResultSet' in other contexts where its optimization is still valid and desired. This might require a nuanced approach, possibly introducing a conditional check specific to aggregate functions involving 'Coalesce'. This targeted modification ensures 'Coalesce' behaves as expected in all scenarios, preserving the performance optimizations provided by 'EmptyResultSet' while ensuring functional consistency in aggregate queries."
