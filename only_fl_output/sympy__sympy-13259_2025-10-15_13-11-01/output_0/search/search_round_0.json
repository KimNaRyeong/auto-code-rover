        "content": "To address the issue related to the wrong simplification of trigonometric functions with complex arguments in the `Sympy` library, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. First, we need to identify where the `simplify` function is implemented for trigonometric functions. Since `simplify` is a general method that could be in numerous places, it's best to search within the scope of trigonometric functions or simplification utilities.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"simplify\")\n    ```\n\n2. The issue description specifically mentions the `cos` function being incorrectly simplified, and involves trigonometric functions with complex arguments. Hence, it's valuable to look into the implementation of `cos` and any related simplification logic it may interact with.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Cos\")\n    ```\n\n3. Given the error in simplification involves converting `cos` with complex arguments incorrectly to `cosh`, searching for occurrences of `cosh` could reveal where this transformation is being incorrectly applied.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Cosh\")\n    ```\n\n4. Last, since the issue outlines a specific problem with the interaction between `cos`, and complex numbers along with the `asinh` function, understanding how `asinh` is implemented or used in simplifications could also provide insight.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Asinh\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches should provide code context around the implementation of the `simplify` method, the `Cos`, `Cosh`, and `Asinh` classes, and how complex arguments are handled in trigonometric simplifications within `SymPy`. This information will be pivotal for diagnosing and subsequently patching the bug described in the issue."
