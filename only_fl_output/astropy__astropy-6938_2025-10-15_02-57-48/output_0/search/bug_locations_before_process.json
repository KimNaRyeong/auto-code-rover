        "intended_behavior": "The code inside `_scale_back_ascii` is attempting to replace occurrences of the character 'E' with 'D' in `output_field` whenever 'D' is present in the `format` string. This is presumably to handle different representations of floating-point numbers where 'D' denotes an exponent in the context of FITS files. However, because `replace` does not modify the object in-place but rather returns a modified copy, the current implementation fails to update `output_field` as intended.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality, the method's code should be corrected to ensure that the replacement effect is applied to `output_field`. This could be achieved by updating the assignment operation to capture the returned value from the `replace` method, like so:\n\n```python\nif 'D' in format:\n    output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\n```\n\nThis adjustment ensures that `output_field` is updated with the replacement made, thereby correctly handling the exponent separator in floating-point numbers as intended. This modification maintains the original functionality of converting exponent delimiters while addressing the bug."
