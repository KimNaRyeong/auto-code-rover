This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Since the problem arises with the comparison between versions in a string format, leading to incorrect evaluations for versions like '0.10' being considered less than '0.6', the critical aspects to investigate would be:\n\n1. **Location and implementation of `needs_extensions` check** - To find this, we need to search for either the declaration of this check or where it's likely applied in the project codebase.\n\n2. **Version comparison logic** - It's essential to understand how versions are currently compared, as the issue specifically points out a flaw in treating version numbers as strings rather than numbers.\n\nGiven these needs, the following search APIs will be used:\n\n- `search_code(\"needs_extensions\")`: This will help in finding where and how `needs_extensions` is declared or used within the project to ensure we're looking at the correct part of the codebase for the issue.\n  \n- `search_code(\"version comparison\")`: Although the exact phrase \"version comparison\" might not be present in the code, this search can help identify how version comparisons are conducted, pointing towards functions or methods that deal with version checking logic.\n\nThese searches aim to gather enough context about where `needs_extensions` is implemented and how version comparisons are handled in the codebase, directly addressing the issue's core components."

This relationship could imply that part of the bug\u2014incorrectly handling extension version comparisons\u2014might originate or be enforced by logic within this configuration space.\n\n2. **sphinx/extension.py** - The multiple matches in this file suggest it plays a significant role in managing extensions, including registering, validating, and possibly enforcing requirements like minimum version constraints. The issue's core\u2014the misinterpretation of version strings during comparison\u2014could stem from the methods involved in these processes.\n\nGiven the absence of explicit \"version comparison\" logic in the search results, it appears that addressing the bug will require a deeper look into how these files implement or invoke version checks. Specifically, we should be looking for the following:\n\n- **Implementation details of `needs_extensions`**: Understanding the exact mechanism through which extensions and their versions are registered and verified against the required minimum versions. We expected to find how versions are compared, whether directly within these references or by calling out to utility functions or external libraries designed for version comparison.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: The correct implementation should accurately compare version numbers, acknowledging that version numbers should be compared numerically (major.minor.patch) rather than lexicographically as strings. This means correctly identifying, for instance, '0.10.0' as greater than '0.6.0'.\n\nGiven the gap in our context\u2014specifically how versions are compared\u2014it might be beneficial to look directly into the mentioned files for specifics on how `needs_extensions` performs version checks. Thus, the next steps involve specific inquiries into:\n\n- `sphinx/config.py`\n- `sphinx/extension.py`\n\nThese files should provide insight into how extension requirements are defined, parsed, and validated, including potentially revealing the mechanism of version comparison that led to the reported issue. This inquiry aims to identify the precise location(s) responsible for the flawed version comparison logic and understand the intended mechanism for accurately comparing extension versions, setting the stage for drafting a resolution to the bug. \n\nTo progress, we might consider these follow-up API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/config.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/extension.py\")`\n\nThese calls focus on locating the implementation of `needs_extensions` within the identified files to understand how they handle version comparisons for extensions."

We do not need more context at this moment based on the current analysis and available information.\n\n2. **Bug Locations:**\n\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `sphinx/extension.py`\n     - **Class/Method:** Specific class and method details are not provided; however, the method or function that implements or interprets `needs_extensions` within this file need to be examined.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The code responsible for version comparison within `needs_extensions` or any associated version checking logic should correctly compare semantic versioning numbers. This means parsing the version strings into numerical components and comparing them numerically to ensure that, for instance, version '0.10.0' is correctly recognized as greater than '0.6.0'. This can be achieved by utilizing a version parsing library that understands semantic versioning, or by implementing a custom comparator that accurately reflects the hierarchy of major.minor.patch components. The existing functionality for determining if an extension meets the required minimum version should be preserved, but enhanced to ensure accurate version comparison. This modification will resolve the issue of some extensions mistakenly flagged as not meeting the version requirements due to incorrect string-based comparison.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sphinx/config.py`\n     - **Class/Method:** Details about the specific class or method are not explicit from the current context; nevertheless, any logic within this file that leverages or influences `needs_extensions`, particularly in comparing or evaluating extension versions, should be scrutinized.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** If `config.py` plays a role in defining, parsing, or enforcing `needs_extensions` version constraints, it must ensure that extension versions are compared using a method that respects semantic versioning rules. The intended behavior is to parse and compare version numbers correctly, recognizing the proper order of versions beyond simple string-based comparisons. For instance, facilitating or ensuring that any utilities or methods used for version constraints are capable of semantic version analysis.\n\nThese locations are pivotal to the functionality related to the issue reported. Fixing the version comparison logic to accurately reflect semantic versioning should directly address the reported bug, ensuring that extension versions are correctly recognized and accepted when meeting or exceeding the required minimum versions. This fix should preserve the utility's intention to verify that all necessary extensions are of adequate versions for the project's needs, thereby maintaining the existing functionality while correcting the flawed version comparison."
