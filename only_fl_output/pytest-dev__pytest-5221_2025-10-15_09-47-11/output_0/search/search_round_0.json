        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to locate where the command `pytest --fixtures` is implemented or handled in the pytest codebase. This likely involves finding where fixture details are retrieved and displayed to the user. We should start by looking for the command-line parsing mechanism that handles `--fixtures` and any associated logic for displaying fixtures. Likely, we'll need to identify the method that outputs fixtures information and modify it to include fixture scopes.\n\nGiven this approach, I'll make the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"parse_arguments\")`: To find the method where command-line arguments, like `--fixtures`, are parsed.\n2. `search_code(\"--fixtures\")`: To directly find references to the `--fixtures` argument in the codebase, which can point us to related methods or files.\n3. `search_method(\"show_fixtures_per_plugin\")`: Assuming a method like this exists based on a typical naming convention in pytest or similar tools, which would handle the displaying of fixture information for `--fixtures` argument. If this specific method does not exist, the search will help narrow down the relevant naming convention used in pytest."
