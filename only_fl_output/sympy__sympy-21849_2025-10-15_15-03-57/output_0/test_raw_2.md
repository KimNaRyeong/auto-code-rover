Given the instructions and the requirement to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (to simulate the problem) and to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, the previous misunderstanding pertained to the outcome expectation, and it seems like we did reproduce the issue effectively but let's clarify the exit codes to align with your request. Since you want the script to exit with code 0 upon successful demonstration of the issue, and considering that the script correctly catches the error, I'll adjust the template slightly to better meet your specifications:

```python
def main():
    import sympy as sp

    try:
        # Attempt to perform an operation known to cause the issue.
        function = sp.Pow(sp.LambertW(2), 2)
        
        # Trying to simulate the rendering process to LaTeX manually, which is similar to what occurs inside JupyterLab.
        latex_representation = sp.printing.latex(function)
        
        # If no exception was raised to this point, it means the issue did not occur as expected.
        raise AssertionError("The expected issue did not occur.")
    except TypeError as e:
        # Specifically catching TypeError because it's the reported error type.
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other unexpected exceptions that might occur.
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the script executed as expected (i.e., demonstrating the issue).
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code structure will exit with code 0 if it properly catches a `TypeError`, which is expected given the issue with rendering `LambertW` to LaTeX in the Sympy package. The `AssertionError` serves as a way to indicate that the script did not encounter the expected issue, meaning the issue is either resolved or the script did not properly simulate the conditions under which the issue occurs.
