Currently, it removes a lookup from `cls.class_lookups` but does not clear cached lookups, leading to potential inconsistent state or stale lookup information. The intended behavior is to call `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` after the lookup is removed from `cls.class_lookups`. This change would align the behavior of `_unregister_lookup` with that of `register_lookup`, ensuring that any changes to lookup registration state are accurately reflected in the cache state, thus preserving the integrity and consistency of the system's functioning. This modification should be thread-safe and take into consideration the existing system logic to avoid introducing any new issues."
