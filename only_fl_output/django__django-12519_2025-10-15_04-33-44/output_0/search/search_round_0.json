I tried upgrading to Django 3.0.2 and now I get duplicate results. Even tho they query should be distinct.

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned regarding subquery annotations being omitted in a group by query section when multiple annotations are declared, and considering the detailed SQL queries provided in the issue description, we need specific information about how the Django ORM constructs these queries. Given the detailed nature of the issue revolving around Django's ORM's behavior when upgrading from version 2.2.9 to 3.0.2, the involved components are likely related to query construction, the handling of subqueries, and possibly the aggregation and annotation mechanisms.\n\nHere are the API calls that would provide the necessary context to begin formulating a solution:\n\n1. Search for the class or method involved in constructing group by queries. Since the specific classes or methods are not directly mentioned, we can infer from Django's architecture that classes like `QuerySet`, and methods such as `annotate()` and `aggregate()` could be involved. Thus, we aim to find methods or classes responsible for constructing or modifying the SQL query, especially concerning grouping and distinct selections.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"annotate\")\nsearch_method(\"aggregate\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue might also be related to the ORM's internal SQL compiler, which is responsible for producing the final SQL queries from QuerySet operations, we should look into classes that could be responsible for this compilation process, like `SQLCompiler`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"SQLCompiler\")\n```\n\n3. The issue description mentions changes in the group by section of the generated SQL between two versions of Django. This suggests that changes in how Django handles annotations or constructs the group by clause could be at fault. It would be beneficial to look at the code snippets where annotations are added to the query and how group by clauses are decided.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"group by\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a better understanding of the components responsible for the described bug and any relevant changes between Django versions 2.2.9 and 3.0.2 that could have affected query generation, especially with regard to distinct selections, subqueries, and grouping."
