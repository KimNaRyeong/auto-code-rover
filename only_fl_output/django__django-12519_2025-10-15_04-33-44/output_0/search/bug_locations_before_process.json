        "intended_behavior": "The `annotate` method should ensure that when generating the SQL for a queryset with multiple annotations, especially those that include subqueries, these annotations are correctly included in the GROUP BY section of the SQL query. This inclusion is critical to prevent duplicate results due to the omission of essential fields from the GROUP BY clause. To resolve the issue, the method may require adjustments in how it constructs the queryset's annotations, ensuring that subquery annotations are not omitted in any scenario. The fix should preserve the functionality of allowing complex annotations and aggregates within the same query, without introducing duplicates in the returned results."

        "intended_behavior": "The SQLCompiler class may need a review or enhancement in the methods responsible for constructing the GROUP BY clause, such as `get_group_by`, ensuring that all conditions leading to the correct inclusion of annotations, particularly subquery annotations, are met. The intended behavior is to enhance the logic so that it accurately recognizes when annotations (especially those involving subqueries) necessitate inclusion in the GROUP BY clause to avoid result set duplication and maintain consistency with previous Django versions while still allowing for optimizations introduced in newer versions. This might include refining how the compiler assesses and decides the fields and expressions to include in the GROUP BY clause based on the annotations present in the queryset. The adjustments described aim to correct the regression, ensuring that the ORM's handling of subquery annotations in conjunction with GROUP BY clauses is both accurate and consistent with expected behavior, thus preserving the robustness and reliability of the Django ORM across versions."
