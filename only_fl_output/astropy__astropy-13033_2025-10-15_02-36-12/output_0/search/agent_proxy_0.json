We also need insight into how `TimeSeries` object validates required columns, since the exception seems to be thrown during a validation check that is likely called sometime after the removal of a column. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"TimeSeries\")` - To find out which file(s) the `TimeSeries` class is defined in.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"remove_column\", \"TimeSeries\")` - To locate the `remove_column` method within the `TimeSeries` class. This will help understand how columns are being removed and if it directly checks for required columns or triggers any validation method that does so.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"TimeSeries\")` - To understand how `_required_columns` is initialized or set in `TimeSeries` objects. This could give a hint if `_required_columns` is a standard part of `TimeSeries` or a custom addition in the reproduction steps.\n\n4. `search_code(\"TimeSeries object is invalid\")` - This will help locate where the misleading exception message is generated and which method or section of the code is responsible for validating required columns in a `TimeSeries` object.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive insight into how `TimeSeries` handles columns, especially how it checks for required ones and where the misleading exception originates from."
