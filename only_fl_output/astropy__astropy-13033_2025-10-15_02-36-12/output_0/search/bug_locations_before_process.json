        "intended_behavior": "The method `_check_required_columns` needs to be updated to ensure that it can accurately identify when specific required columns are missing from a `TimeSeries` object. Instead of a generic error message that might imply an issue with the 'time' column exclusively, the exception raised should clearly list which required column(s) are missing. This behavior should provide clearer guidance to users and avoid confusion. Ensure that the revised method can handle scenarios where multiple required columns are missing, offering a comprehensive and informative error message detailing all absent required columns. This approach is important for usability and for helping users quickly identify and correct issues in their code. Existing functionality regarding how required columns are verified should remain intact, ensuring that any modifications only enhance clarity and user understanding without altering the fundamental expectations of the `TimeSeries` or `BaseTimeSeries` objects concerning required columns."
