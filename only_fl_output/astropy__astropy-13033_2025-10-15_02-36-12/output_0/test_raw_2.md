This script is designed to reproduce a specific issue with the Astropy `TimeSeries` class where attempting to remove a required column yields a misleading exception message. The script will attempt to remove a required column from a `TimeSeries` object and check if the exception message matches the expected misleading message. If it catches the correct type of exception (`ValueError`) but with a different message, it prints the exception's stack trace to help diagnose the issue or to confirm if the issue has been fixed in a version different from the originally reported one. If an unexpected type of exception is caught or if no exception is raised when one is expected, the script will end with an exit code of 1, indicating an unexpected outcome.
