        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather information about class hierarchy, specifically how class D (e.g., `Landsat`) is defined in relation to its base class (`RasterDataset`) and ultimately to `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. This requires exploring the class definitions and possibly how documentation is generated from these. Given the specific example provided in the issue of the `Landsat` class, let's break down the required API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Class Definition of `Landsat`**: First, we need to understand how `Landsat` is defined within its respective file. The issue link points to `torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py`.\n2. **Class Definition of `RasterDataset`**: Since `RasterDataset` is mentioned as the direct superclass of `Landsat`, gathering its definition is key to understand the inheritance chain.\n3. **Class Definition of `Dataset`**: Identifying how `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is being referred to directly or indirectly will also be crucial, especially since it's being incorrectly identified as the base class.\n4. **Look for Documentation Generation Files**: Understanding how Sphinx utilizes the codebase to generate documentation is essential. Although not directly callable through the APIs listed, identifying where Sphinx extensions might be defined or customised (likely within the `/docs` directory) will help in diagnosing the issue.\n\nBased on the tasks outlined above, these API calls will be essential:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Landsat\", \"torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py\")`: This locates the definition of `Landsat` within its specific file.\n- `search_class(\"RasterDataset\")`: Since we're unsure of the exact file location of `RasterDataset`, this broader search will help identify it within the project.\n- `search_code(\"class RasterDataset\")`: To ensure we capture the class definition, using a code search can complement the class search, especially if `RasterDataset` is defined in an unexpected manner.\n- `search_class(\"Dataset\")`: To understand the inheritance chain leading back to `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\n\nThese API calls are designed to capture a comprehensive understanding of the class hierarchy and potential points where the documentation generation could be misinterpreting the inheritance chain."
