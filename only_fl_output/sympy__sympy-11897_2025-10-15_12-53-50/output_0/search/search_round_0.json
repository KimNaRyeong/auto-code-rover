        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to first gather more context about the implementation of the LaTeX and pretty printing functionalities within this codebase. Based on the descriptions provided in the issue, it seems that the inconsistencies stem from how expressions are being printed in LaTeX format compared to the pretty printer format.\n\nLet's start with these actions:\n\n1. **Search for the LaTeX printer implementation**: Since the issue mentions that the LaTeX printer's output is not consistent with the pretty printer, we need to look into the code responsible for generating LaTeX representations of expressions. Usually, this would be encapsulated in a method or class dedicated to LaTeX printing.\n\n2. **Search for the pretty printer implementation**: Similarly, we need to understand how the pretty printer formats expressions. There is likely a separate method or class handling this.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following search API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method(\"latex\")`: This will help us find the method(s) responsible for generating the LaTeX representations of expressions.\n- `search_method(\"pprint\")`: To find the method(s) responsible for the pretty printing of expressions.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point by identifying the relevant parts of the codebase involved in the printing of expressions in both formats. From there, we can delve deeper into the specifics of how these printers handle expressions differently."
