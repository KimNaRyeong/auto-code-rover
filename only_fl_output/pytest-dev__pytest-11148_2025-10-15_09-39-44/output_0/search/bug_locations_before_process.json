        "intended_behavior": "The tests should ensure that when importlib is used to dynamically load or manipulate modules, it does so in a way that reflects and maintains the integrity of the application's module namespace. Specifically, these methods should: Confirm that dynamically loaded modules do not lead to the unintentional creation of multiple instances or versions of modules intended to be singletons or uniquely represented within the application context. Simulate the application's behavior as closely as possible in terms of module loading and namespace manipulation to detect and prevent scenarios that could lead to discrepancies between test and production environments. Include validation steps to check the uniqueness and consistency of critical modules across different parts of the application, ensuring that changes or actions performed on those modules in one context are recognized and persist across all contexts."
