        "intended_behavior": "The `to_dataframe` method should be enhanced to handle `DataArray` objects with a mix of stacked (multi-indexed) dimensions and additional dimensions correctly. It should construct a `DataFrame` with a `MultiIndex` that accurately represents all dimensions involved. When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays where one or more dimensions are stacked, the method needs to ensure that the resulting `DataFrame` maintains a hierarchical index that combines the multi-indexed dimensions with any other present dimensions without leading to errors such as `NotImplementedError` for `MultiIndex`. This enhancement should not disrupt the existing functionality for converting simpler, non-stacked `DataArray` objects to `DataFrame`."

        "intended_behavior": "This method requires adjustments to support conversion from a `DataArray` with one or more multi-indexed dimensions plus additional standard dimensions to a pandas `Series` with a proper `MultiIndex`. The `to_series` operation must generate a `Series` where the index reflects every dimension from the `DataArray`, incorporating both the stacked dimensions as a `MultiIndex` and any other dimensions. Like `to_dataframe`, this fix should respect and maintain the method's current handling of `DataArray`s that do not involve complex, multi-indexed structures."
