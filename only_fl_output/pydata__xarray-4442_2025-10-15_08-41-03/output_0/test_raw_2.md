This standalone Python script `reproducer.py` attempts to reproduce the issue outlined in the description. If the problem (as originally described) is present, it is expected that an exception will be raised during either the `to_series()` or `to_dataframe()` operations on a `DataArray` with multi-indexed dimensions alongside additional dimensions. In such a case, the script captures and prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exits with a non-zero status code, indicating failure (thus allowing automated systems to easily detect the failure mode). Conversely, if no exceptions are raised (indicating a potential fix of the issue or its absence in the tested environment), the script simply reports success and exits with a status code of 0.
