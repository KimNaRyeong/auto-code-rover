        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how migrations and squashed migrations are handled in the project. The issue mentions that when a squashed migration is unapplied, and the replaced migration files are still around, the `MigrationExecutor` does not mark the squashed migration as unapplied. Therefore, we need to find where the squashed migrations are being handled, specifically in parts of the code where the migrations are marked as unapplied.\n\nI will perform the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `MigrationExecutor` class**: This is to find where this class is defined and gather context around its implementation, as this class seems to be central to the issue.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for a method related to unapplying migrations in the `MigrationExecutor` class**: Since the issue deals with the act of unapplying a squashed migration, we need to find the method(s) responsible for this logic. There's likely a method in the `MigrationExecutor` class handling the unapply logic.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"unapply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for handling of squashed migrations**: To see if there's any explicit logic related to squashed migrations that might be affecting their status when unapplied, we need to look into how squashed migrations are handled. This information may be present in methods that deal specifically with squashed migrations or in code comments/documentation that mention \"squash\" or \"squashed migration\".\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"squashed migration\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand the current implementation surrounding the issue and help in identifying why squashed migrations are not being marked as unapplied correctly."
