        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, let's interpret what we've found:\n\n### `MigrationExecutor` Class Context\nThe `MigrationExecutor` class, found within `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, is a central piece in handling the application and roll-back (unapplication) of migrations. This class facilitates various key operations involving migrations, such as applying them (`apply_migration`), unapplying them (`unapply_migration`), and managing the migration plan.\n\n### `unapply_migration` Method Context\nThe `unapply_migration` method within the `MigrationExecutor` class is directly responsible for reversing (unapplying) a migration. From lines 246-262, we see the method's structure involves checking if the unapply action is fake before proceeding to actually unapply the migration using the provided `schema_editor`. Notably, for migrations that replace others (indicated by the `migration.replaces` attribute), it iterates through each and records their unapplied status individually using `self.recorder.record_unapplied(app_label, name)`. This is a significant detail when considering the issue at hand about squashed migrations not being marked as unapplied correctly.\n\n### `squashed migration` Code Snippets Context\nFrom the search for \u201csquashed migration\u201d, snippets across multiple files indicate that squashed migrations are specifically addressed within the Django migrations framework. The `executor.py`, `loader.py`, `graph.py`, and management command files all contain logic or references to handling squashed migrations. This suggests a distributed logic concerning how squashed migrations are recognized, handled, and possibly rolled back across the Django migrations infrastructure.\n\n### Analysis Based on the Issue Description\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The code within `unapply_migration` is designed to reverse a migration. When the migration being unapplied is a squashed one and replaces other migrations, it records each of the replaced migrations as unapplied.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The relationship here is direct: The described issue involves squashed migrations not being marked as unapplied when the replaced migration files still exist. The `unapply_migration` method does handle marking replaced migrations as unapplied, but the bug implies that there might be a condition or scenario this method doesn\u2019t account for correctly, particularly concerning squashed migrations.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be that when a squashed migration is unapplied, not only should each migration that it replaces be marked as unapplied (as it currently does), but the squashed migration itself should also be correctly marked as unapplied in all scenarios. This would include cases where the original migrations (replaced by the squashed migration) still exist in the codebase. It's possible that additional logic or checks are required to ensure that the squashed migration is flagged as unapplied, potentially involving changes in how the `MigrationExecutor` interacts with migrations marked with the `replaces` attribute.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems necessary to further investigate the mechanisms by which squashed migrations are tracked and marked as (un)applied, possibly looking into the `MigrationRecorder` and how it interacts with the `unapply_migration` method, as well as how squashed migrations are treated differently or similarly to regular migrations in terms of recording their application status."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Currently, the method correctly handles marking each of the replaced migrations as unapplied but does not explicitly ensure that the squashed migration is marked as unapplied in scenarios where the replaced migrations files are still present. To resolve the issue, this method needs to be modified or extended to include a condition that checks if the migration being unapplied is a squashed migration and, if so, ensure that this squashed migration is also recorded as unapplied. This could involve adding a check after the loop that handles the `migration.replaces` list (if it exists), specifically to cover the case where the squashed migration itself is not properly marked. The existing functionality of recording each replaced migration as unapplied should be preserved, and additional logic should only extend to cover the squashed migration itself.\n\nThis modification ensures that the state of the squashed migration reflects its actual application status in the database schema, aligning with the expectations for the management and rollback of migrations within a Django project."
