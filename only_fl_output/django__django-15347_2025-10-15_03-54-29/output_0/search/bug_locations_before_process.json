Whenever `extra_tags` is an empty string, it should still be serialized explicitly to distinguish it from `None`. This could involve always including `extra_tags` in the serialized list but providing a distinguishable value for cases where `extra_tags` is an empty string (such as using a placeholder value that is unlikely to be used as actual tags)."

This may include handling a special placeholder for an empty string `extra_tags` (as introduced by the `MessageEncoder` modifications) and converting it back to an empty string during the deserialization process. The method should explicitly set `extra_tags` to an empty string if the serialized message was marked to indicate that `extra_tags` was originally an empty string, thereby preserving the intended state of `extra_tags` through the serialization-deserialization cycle."
