This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue, we need to understand how serialization and deserialization are handled for the `Message` object, specifically regarding the `extra_tags` attribute. The issue mentioned involves classes `Message`, `MessageEncoder`, and `MessageDecoder` and their behavior with `extra_tags=\"\"`. To gain sufficient context for resolving the issue, we should:\n\n1. Identify how the `Message` class is defined to understand the structure and handling of `extra_tags`.\n2. Understand how `MessageEncoder` serializes the `Message` object, especially the condition that leads to `extra_tags=\"\"` being changed to `None`.\n3. Understand how `MessageDecoder` deserializes the encoded message back into a `Message` object and how it processes `extra_tags`.\n\nThus, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n- `search_class(\"Message\")`: To find the definition of the `Message` class.\n- `search_class(\"MessageEncoder\")`: To understand the serialization process.\n- `search_class(\"MessageDecoder\")`: To understand the deserialization process.\n\nAdditionally, since the issue points to a specific logic flaw (\"...MessageEncoder checks for the truthiness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None...\"), we can look into the specific methods that handle the serialization and deserialization in both `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"encode\", \"MessageEncoder\")`: To inspect how encoding of `Message` objects is handled, particularly the treatment of `extra_tags`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"MessageDecoder\")`: To inspect the decoding logic and handling of `extra_tags`.\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive overview of the related code and logic, which is crucial for developing a patch to fix the issue."
