        "content": "To analyze and resolve the issue with `idiff` not supporting `Eq` and functions like `f(x)` instead of `y`, we need to gather more context about how `idiff` is implemented, where it's encountering errors, and its expected inputs. Given the file path \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\" and the function `idiff`, let's start with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")` - This will help us understand the implementation details of the `idiff` method, including how it currently handles inputs and where it might be failing for `Eq` and functions.\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")` - Since there's an `IndexError` stemming from this line, we want more context around this code snippet to see how it's being used and potentially mishandling cases leading to an empty list.\n3. `search_code_in_file(\"raise ValueError(\\\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s\\\" % y)\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")` - Given the second part of the reported issue relates to an exception being raised for not recognizing `f(x)` as a valid symbol, this will provide context about where and why this validation is failing."
