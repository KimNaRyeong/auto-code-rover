Given the requirements and understanding the issue properly, below is an updated standalone Python file `reproducer.py`. This script is specifically designed to reproduce the issue with performing an HTTP GET request to `http://.example.com`, expecting a `UnicodeError` but aiming to verify that an `InvalidURL` should be raised instead. Incorporating the function to print the stack trace ensures that the error's details are clearly visible for debugging purposes.

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import InvalidURL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def test_invalid_url_exception():
    try:
        requests.get("http://.example.com")
        assert False, "Expected an exception to be raised."
    except InvalidURL as e:
        # This is the expected outcome once the issue is fixed.
        print("Success: InvalidURL exception was raised as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        if e.__class__.__name__ == "UnicodeError":
            # The issue still exists if UnicodeError is caught
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "Failure: UnicodeError was raised instead of InvalidURL."
        else:
            # For any other type of exception, print stack trace and raise AssertionError
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, f"An unexpected exception was raised: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_invalid_url_exception()
```

This script checks for the reported issue by attempting to access a URL that is known to cause the `UnicodeError` under the mentioned circumstances. It specifically catches exceptions, looking for `InvalidURL` to confirm the fix or `UnicodeError` to demonstrate the issue persists, using the `print_stacktrace` function to provide details of the exception if it's not the expected `InvalidURL`. It ensures an assertion is raised in case of failure (i.e., if the `UnicodeError` is encountered or another unexpected exception is caught) and outputs a success message if the expected `InvalidURL` is caught, indicating the issue has been resolved accordingly.
