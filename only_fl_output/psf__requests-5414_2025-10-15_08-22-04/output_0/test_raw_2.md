Based on the clarification and the specified requirements for capturing the expected `UnicodeError` (or ideally an `InvalidURL` exception post-fix), the following Python script `reproducer.py` can be used. It incorporates your provided function to print the stack trace clearly. This script is designed to directly address and reproduce the described issue, aiming to fail with an `AssertionError` if the problem is present and to exit gracefully with code 0 when the issue is resolved.

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import InvalidURL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    url = "http://.example.com"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
    except InvalidURL:
        print("InvalidURL exception is correctly raised.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Verify if the error is actually a UnicodeError, which is the issue we're looking for.
        if isinstance(e, UnicodeError):
            raise AssertionError("UnicodeError encountered, indicating the issue is still present.") from e
        else:
            raise AssertionError(f"Unexpected error type encountered: {e.__class__.__name__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code attempts to request `http://.example.com` using the `requests.get` method. According to the issue description, a `UnicodeError` is raised when it should rather raise an `InvalidURL` exception. The script directly addresses this by looking for the expected `InvalidURL` exception as an indication that the issue has been fixed. If any other exception occurs, it uses the `print_stacktrace` function, provided in your requirement, to print out the details of the error.

If the script encounters a `UnicodeError`, it explicitly raises an `AssertionError`, thus indicating the presence of the issue. Conversely, if the `InvalidURL` exception is correctly raised, it prints a success message and exits with code 0, signaling that the issue has either been fixed or is not present. This approach allows for clear identification and validation of the issue's state based on the expected behavior correction.
