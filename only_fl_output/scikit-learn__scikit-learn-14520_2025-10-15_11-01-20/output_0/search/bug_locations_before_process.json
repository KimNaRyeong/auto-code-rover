The intended behavior is to check the 'copy' argument and, based on its value, decide whether to directly modify the input data or work on a copy of it. This ensures that when 'copy=False', the transformation is done in-place, reducing memory usage."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the 'transform' method, 'fit_transform' should also properly handle the 'copy' parameter. While the existing method already sets 'copy=False' when calling '_tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)', ensuring consistency and clarity in handling the 'copy' parameter throughout the class is essential. This means confirming that the 'copy=False' behavior aligns with the intended optimization and does not conflict with user expectations or other parts of the code where 'copy' could be set differently."
