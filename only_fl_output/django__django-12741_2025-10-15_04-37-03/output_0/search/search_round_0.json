Let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. **`DatabaseOperations` class**: We need to understand if `DatabaseOperations` is the correct class and verify its existence within the project.\n2. **`execute_sql_flush` method**: We need to see the current implementation of this method to understand how the `using` parameter is utilized within its body.\n3. **Method usages**: How the method is called within the project, specifically looking for instances where `connection.alias` is passed to satisfy the `using` parameter, as mentioned in the issue description.\n\nLet's draft the necessary API calls to gather this information:\n\n1. **Class Search**: To confirm the existence of `DatabaseOperations` class and get an overview of where it's defined.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DatabaseOperations\")\n   ```\n   \n2. **Method in Class Search**: To get details on the current implementation of `execute_sql_flush` within `DatabaseOperations`.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"DatabaseOperations\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Method Usage Search**: To locate calls to `execute_sql_flush` that are passing `connection.alias`, which might give insight into how frequently the method is used following the suggested pattern.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"execute_sql_flush(connection.alias\")\n   ```\n\nThese search actions would provide a comprehensive understanding of the implementation specifics of `execute_sql_flush`, its relevance within the `DatabaseOperations` class, and how it's being used across the project. This information should be enough to make an informed decision on how to proceed with simplifying the method's signature as requested in the issue."
