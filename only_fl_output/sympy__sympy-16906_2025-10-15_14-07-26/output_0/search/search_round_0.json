Search for the `OneMatrix` class to understand its current implementation.\n2. Search for the classes `ZeroMatrix` and `Identity` for comparison and to see how their printing is currently implemented or needs to be modified.\n3. Search for methods related to pretty printing and MathML presentation printing to see how they currently handle matrices and to identify where the new functionality for `OneMatrix` can be integrated.\n4. Since the issue describes specific printing methods (str, pretty, and MathML presentation), let's find those methods to see if there's an existing framework for handling different types of matrices or if there need to be new implementations for `OneMatrix`.\n\nBased on these needs, here are the concrete API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"OneMatrix\")`\n- `search_class(\"ZeroMatrix\")`\n- `search_class(\"Identity\")`\n- `search_method(\"pretty_print\")`\n- `search_method(\"mathml\")`\n- `search_code(\"str\")`"
