        "intended_behavior": "The method should include error handling for `ValueError` thrown by the `to_url` method of URL converters. The enhanced behavior could involve wrapping the call to `converters[k].to_url(v)` inside a try-except block, catching `ValueError`. Upon catching this exception, the resolver should continue with the next possible match without raising an error. This change allows dynamic selection between multiple named routes by gracefully handling conversion failures in `to_url`, enabling it to treat them as signals for route mismatches similar to how `ValueError` is treated in `to_python` during URL resolution. This handling should be carefully designed to ensure it does not disrupt the existing error handling logic for other types of conversion errors that might require attention beyond simply trying the next route possibility."
