This script attempts to verify that when records in an `astropy.table.QTable` are grouped by a column containing quantities (i.e., values with units), the keys of these groups are indeed quantities with units, as expected. On encountering the issue where the keys lack their associated units, it will raise an `AssertionError`. The presence of this error is considered to signify that the issue is still unresolved. Conversely, absence of the error (i.e., when the script runs without exceptions) indicates the issue has been fixed.
