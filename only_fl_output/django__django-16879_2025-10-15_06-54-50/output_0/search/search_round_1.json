To avoid a zero division problem, we were using a Case-When clause over that field. It works well on any 4.1 and prior versions but stopped working since 4.2, raising a FieldError like:\nCannot resolve keyword 'sum_total_objs' into field\nThe bug is reproducible with an extra test on the django aggregation test suite:\ndef test_referenced_group_by_aggregation_over_annotation(self):\ntotal_books_qs = (\nBook.objects.filter(authors__pk=OuterRef(\"pk\"))\n.order_by()\n.values(\"pk\")\n.annotate(total=Count(\"pk\"))\n.values(\"total\")\n)\nannotated_authors = Author.objects.annotate(\ntotal_books=Subquery(total_books_qs.annotate(\ntotal_books=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books\")),\ntotal_books_a=Subquery(total_books_qs.filter(\nname__istartswith=\"a\"\n).annotate(\ntotal_books_a=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books_a\")),\n).values(\n\"pk\",\n\"total_books\",\n\"total_books_a\",\n).order_by(\"-total_books\")\ntotals = annotated_authors.aggregate(\nsum_total_books=Sum(\"total_books\"),\nsum_total_books_a=Sum(\"total_books_a\"),\na_over_total_rate=Case(\nWhen(\nsum_total_books=0,\nthen=0,\n),\ndefault=Round(\n(Sum(\"total_books_a\") / Sum(\"total_books\")) * 100, 2\n),\noutput_field=FloatField(),\n),\n)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books'], 3)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books_a'], 0)\nself.assertEqual(totals['a_over_total_rate'], 0)\nThanks for the support!\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the information retrieved from the search results, let's analyze the context and plan the next steps.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Class `Subquery`\n- **Purpose**: The `Subquery` class is used in Django to represent a SQL subquery. It's a component that can be used within querysets to compose complex queries, including those where a queryset is nested within another.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The issue describes a problem using `Subquery` with aggregation functions (`Sum`, `Case`, `When`) in Django 4.2 that did not exist in Django 4.1. This class is central to the described problem.\n- **Intended Behavior**: In the context of the issue, `Subquery` should allow for the aggregation of annotated fields, both in direct aggregation and conditionally adjusted aggregation (with `Case` and `When`), without raising a `FieldError`.\n\n#### 2. Class `OuterRef`\n- **Purpose**: `OuterRef` is used in subqueries to reference fields from an outer queryset. It's essential for correlating values between the main query and a subquery.\n- **Relation to Bug**: As `OuterRef` is used within subqueries that are failing post-upgrade, understanding any changes to its behavior or interaction with the aggregation API is crucial.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The proper function of `OuterRef` in these scenarios would not directly cause the issue but could affect how subqueries are constructed and resolved.\n\n### Considering the Unfound Methods and Code Snippets\n\nThe absence of results for `Sum`, `Case`, `When`, and the specific code snippets related to the bug highlights a couple of potential issues:\n\n- These methods and functionalities likely exist in different files or modules not directly accessed or incorrectly specified in the API calls.\n- There might be a discrepancy in how the Django codebase is structured or named, making direct reference searches insufficient.\n\n### Next Steps for Additional Context\n\nGiven the bug's nature and the missing context around aggregation functions and their application, my revised approach would include:\n\n1. Looking into the file where aggregation functions like `Sum`, `Case`, and `When` are likely defined or referenced. As these are common aggregation operations, they might be part of Django's query framework (`django.db.models.aggregates` for `Sum` and `django.db.models` for `Case` and `When`).\n2. Searching for the implementation or usage examples of `Case`, `When`, and `Sum` in more general terms, given their absence in the prior search results.\n3. Considering the possibility that the issue might be resulting from changes in Django 4.2, focusing on the release notes or changes in the version could be illuminating. Searching for any changelogs or migration guides might offer insights into changes affecting the aggregation over annotated fields.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would provide additional useful context:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Aggregate\")\nsearch_class(\"Case\")\nsearch_class(\"When\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"Sum(\", \"django/db/models/aggregates.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"Case(\", \"django/db/models/expressions.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"When(\", \"django/db/models/expressions.py\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to cover the broader scope of aggregation functionalities in Django and the potential impact of version changes mentioned in the issue description."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1.\n\n2.\n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n  - **Class**: `Subquery`\n  - **Method**: Not explicitly listed but likely involves `as_sql` or methods controlling output and aggregation behavior.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `Subquery` class should ensure that when it is used within an aggregation context (like within `annotate()` followed by an `aggregate()` call), it retains context on the aggregation level to support subsequent annotations or aggregations without losing scope or causing resolution errors. Specifically, there needs to be a way to maintain aggregation references when using aggregated fields in subsequent calculations, such as with `Sum` over an annotated field inside a `Case` statement. This might involve enhancing how `Subquery` interacts with aggregation functions post Django 4.1 to Django 4.2 upgrade, possibly reintroducing functionality that was inadvertently altered or removed in the update.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n  - **Class**: `OuterRef`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Although `OuterRef` itself may not be directly responsible for the issue, ensuring that its references within subqueries are properly resolved and maintained through aggregation operations is critical. There might not be a direct change needed in `OuterRef`, but it's essential to ascertain that its use within `Subquery` expressions does not contribute to the loss of field resolution as described in the issue. If there has been a change in how `OuterRef` references are handled between Django 4.1 and 4.2 that affects aggregate annotations, then addressing that to restore previous functionality or providing a new, clear way to achieve the same results would be the intended behavior.\n\nGiven the complexity of the described issue and the specialized use of Django's ORM and aggregation framework, resolving the problem would likely require adjusting how these components interact. The solution should ensure backward compatibility to the extent that queries functional in Django 4.1 continue to work post-upgrade while maintaining the enhancements introduced in Django 4.2."
