        "intended_behavior": "The `Subquery` class should ensure that when it is used within an aggregation context (like within `annotate()` followed by an `aggregate()` call), it retains context on the aggregation level to support subsequent annotations or aggregations without losing scope or causing resolution errors. Specifically, there needs to be a way to maintain aggregation references when using aggregated fields in subsequent calculations, such as with `Sum` over an annotated field inside a `Case` statement. This might involve enhancing how `Subquery` interacts with aggregation functions post Django 4.1 to Django 4.2 upgrade, possibly reintroducing functionality that was inadvertently altered or removed in the update."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Although `OuterRef` itself may not be directly responsible for the issue, ensuring that its references within subqueries are properly resolved and maintained through aggregation operations is critical. There might not be a direct change needed in `OuterRef`, but it's essential to ascertain that its use within `Subquery` expressions does not contribute to the loss of field resolution as described in the issue. If there has been a change in how `OuterRef` references are handled between Django 4.1 and 4.2 that affects aggregate annotations, then addressing that to restore previous functionality or providing a new, clear way to achieve the same results would be the intended behavior."
