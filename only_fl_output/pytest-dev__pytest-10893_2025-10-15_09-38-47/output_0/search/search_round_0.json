        "content": "<issue>Use of `rmtree` causes `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.12 alpha\nThe current Python 3.12 alpha has made a change to `rmtree` https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102828, deprecating the `onerror` parameter and replacing it with an `onexc` parameter. Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To properly address the issue submitted, we need to gather context and code snippets related to the use of `rmtree` as mentioned in the deprecation warning for Python 3.12 and the absence of the `addDuration` method in Pytest's handling of `TestCaseFunction`. Specifically, we need to investigate how `rm_rf` is implemented in Pytest and how `TestCaseFunction` interacts or fails to interact with the new `addDuration` API expected by Python 3.12. Thus, we'll structure our search around these two primary facets:\n\n1. **Context on `rmtree` usage within Pytest's `rm_rf` function:**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"rmtree\", \"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\")` to locate the call to `rmtree` within `pathlib.py`, where the `rm_rf` function resides.\n   \n2. **Understanding of `TestCaseFunction` with regards to lacking `addDuration`:**\n   - `search_class(\"TestCaseFunction\")` to find the definition or usage of `TestCaseFunction`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"addDuration\", \"TestCaseFunction\")` to check if `addDuration` is indeed missing or how it's currently implemented.\n\nThese searches should provide necessary context about the current implementation and point out the changes required to resolve the DeprecationWarning and the compatibility issue with the new `addDuration` API."
