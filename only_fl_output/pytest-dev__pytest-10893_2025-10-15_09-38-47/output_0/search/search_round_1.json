Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Analysis of `rmtree` usage within Pytest's `rm_rf` function:\n\nThe provided snippet from `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` for the `rm_rf` function shows that `shutil.rmtree` is being called with an `onerror` parameter, which is a partially applied function, `on_rm_rf_error`, designed to handle read-only errors during the removal process. The `on_rm_rf_error` function itself is meant to deal with specific errors that can occur when attempting to remove directories and files, especially on platforms where permissions issues are common.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:** The use of the `onerror` parameter in `shutil.rmtree` is directly related to the deprecation warning issue in Python 3.12 alpha. The warning results from calling `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter, which Python 3.12 intends to replace with `onexc`. This implies changes will be necessary to align with Python 3.12's updated API expectations.\n\n**Intended behavior:** The goal of `rm_rf` with the `onerror` handling is to robustly remove files and directories, even when faced with read-only file system attributes or other errors that might prevent deletion. To resolve the issue, this behavior should be maintained while adapting the code to use the new `onexc` parameter in place of `onerror`, aligning with Python 3.12's updated `shutil.rmtree` function.\n\n### Analysis of `TestCaseFunction` and absence of `addDuration`:\n\nThe `TestCaseFunction` class in `src/_pytest/unittest.py` is a wrapper around unit tests to integrate them into Pytest's functionality, providing setup and teardown operations, handling test results, and reporting successes, failures, and errors. The class does not currently implement an `addDuration` method.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:** The absence of an `addDuration` method is central to the second part of the issue. CPython 3.12 (alpha) introduces an expectation for test result objects to support an `addDuration` method, which is meant for tracking the duration of test case execution. Pytest's lack of this method in `TestCaseFunction` causes compatibility issues when running Python's unittest cases under Pytest, particularly when warnings are treated as errors.\n\n**Intended behavior:** To resolve this issue, `TestCaseFunction` should be extended to include an `addDuration` method. This method would likely capture the execution time of each test case and report it back in a way that's compatible with Python 3.12's new expectations for test result objects. This would ensure that Pytest remains a viable test runner for unittests in Python 3.12 and beyond.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context:**\n\nGiven the analysis, further context might be necessary to understand specifically how to adapt `rm_rf` to use `onexc` instead of `onerror`, and how to design and implement the `addDuration` method in `TestCaseFunction`. For the former, examining the Python 3.12 documentation or the relevant Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) for the `shutil.rmtree` changes would give insights into how `onexc` is expected to be used. For the latter, looking into how Pytest typically handles and reports test execution time could give clues on how to implement `addDuration` effectively. However, given the specific instructions not to seek external documentation or PEPs directly, the actionable steps involve proceeding with patch preparation based on the best practices for backward-compatible feature addition and deprecation handling in Python."

This means adapting the call to `rmtree` and possibly the design of `on_rm_rf_error` to align with the new API expectations, ensuring errors during directory and file removal are handled appropriately. The functionality should ensure that when errors are encountered during removal, they are processed in a manner compatible with `onexc`, enabling custom error handling while preserving the behavior of safely removing files and directories, including handling read-only attribute errors.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n  - **Class**: `TestCaseFunction`\n  - **Method**: *new method* `addDuration`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: To comply with Python 3.12's updates, a new method named `addDuration` needs to be added to the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method would receive timing information about how long a test case took to execute. The `addDuration` method's role would be to update the test case result with the duration of execution, maintaining compatibility with Python 3.12\u2019s test suite expectations. It must be ensured that this update is compatible with how Pytest handles and reports test durations, effectively integrating with Pytest's existing test result reporting mechanisms. This addition will prevent the warning that occurs when Pytest runs under Python 3.12 with warnings treated as errors, ensuring smooth operation and compatibility."
