As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding the `.limit(n, oo)` method when applied to bell numbers in SymPy, we should execute the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the class where bell numbers are implemented to understand its structure and associated methods. This could either be directly a class named related to \"Bell\" or within a broader class dealing with special numbers or functions.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"bell\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `.limit()` method usage in relation to bell numbers. Since the `.limit()` method is likely to be a part of a more generic class (as limits can be applied to various mathematical expressions), it's helpful to see how it's overridden or used for bell numbers.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"limit\")\n   ```\n\n3. Because the issue mentions a comparison with the behavior of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, it could be insightful to also understand how `.limit()` is handled for these cases.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"Fibonacci(n).limit(n,oo)\")\n   search_code(\"Lucas(n).limit(n,oo)\")\n   ```\n\nThis approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of how the `.limit()` function works, how it is implemented for different types of numbers within SymPy, and hopefully, pinpoint where the logic for handling `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` needs to be adjusted."
