This script `reproducer.py` attempts to reproduce the issue where square brackets in the output of `SeqFormula()` are incorrectly backslash-escaped when rendered. The assertion checks for the presence of the incorrect pattern in the string representation of the sequence. If the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError`, prints a stack trace pointing to where the issue was detected, and exits with a non-zero code indicating failure. If the issue is fixed, the script will complete successfully, printing "No issue found." and exiting with code 0.
