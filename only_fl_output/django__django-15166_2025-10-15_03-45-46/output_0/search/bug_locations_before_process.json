The intended behavior is for the system to recognize and adapt to database backends that require field names to be quoted, such as Snowflake. This would involve checking the database backend being used and applying quoting to fields in SQL queries accordingly, without altering the existing functionality for backends that do not require this."

The method should maintain its current functionality of fetching the cached value for a given key, with the enhancement that the SQL query constructed accounts for the need to quote identifiers when the backend is Snowflake."
