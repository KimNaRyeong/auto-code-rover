This could involve checking if number is None or if str_number resulted in an empty string. This verification step will prevent the IndexError: string index out of range error. The intended behavior would ensure that if number is None, a safe operation is performed, such as returning '0', an empty string, or some placeholder, according to what is deemed appropriate for the application's context, thereby preserving the functionality of formatting number strings while avoiding index errors."
