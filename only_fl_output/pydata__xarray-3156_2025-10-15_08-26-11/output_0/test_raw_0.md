This script attempts to reproduce the specified issue by invoking the situation described in the report (using `groupby` on an empty `DataArray` and expecting it to raise `StopIteration`). The script checks if the issue has been reproduced correctly and will print a detailed stack trace of any unexpected exceptions, facilitating debugging and validation processes. It meets the requirements for detecting the presence of the issue and aiding in its diagnosis.
