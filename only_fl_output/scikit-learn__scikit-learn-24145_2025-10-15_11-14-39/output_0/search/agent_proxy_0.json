Here's how I plan to use the search APIs:\n\n1. Search for the `SplineTransformer` class to understand its current implementation and identify where the output is generated.\n2. Since the proposed solution involves using `design_matrix` from SciPy >= 1.8, I should also look for any existing usage of SciPy functions within `SplineTransformer` to identify where the integration point might be for the sparse output feature.\n3. Lastly, to get a comprehensive view of how `fit_transform` might be currently implemented or used within `SplineTransformer`, which is pertinent since the issue suggests modifying its behavior to return a sparse matrix.\n\nHere are the API calls I will use to gather the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_class(\"SplineTransformer\")`: To get an overview of where the `SplineTransformer` class is defined within the codebase.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"SplineTransformer\")`: To see how `fit_transform` is implemented in the `SplineTransformer` class, since the issue mentions modifying it."
