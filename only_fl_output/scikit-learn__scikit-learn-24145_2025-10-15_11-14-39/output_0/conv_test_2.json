This script assumes that the `SplineTransformer` does not yet support the desired sparse output feature, thus attempting to use this feature should result in an `AssertionError` when the feature isn't implemented, and succeed otherwise.\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ntry:\n    # Import necessary libraries\n    import numpy as np\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer\n    \n    # Test data\n    X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)\n    \n    # Attempt to use a feature that is expected to be missing\n    # The 'sparse=True' parameter should cause an error if the issue is present\n    spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)\n    \n    # If the above line does not raise an error, it implies the issue might have been fixed\n    # However, we should still check the output type\n    transformed = spline.fit_transform(X)\n    \n    # Verify that the output is indeed a sparse matrix\n    # This is the ultimate confirmation that the issue has been addressed\n    if not hasattr(transformed, \"toarray\"):\n        # This error is expected if the output is not sparse as desired\n        raise AssertionError(\"Output is not a sparse matrix.\")\n    \n    # If no exceptions were raised, assume the feature has been correctly implemented\n    print(\"Feature implemented correctly.

Please remember, this script assumes that the `SplineTransformer` with the `sparse` parameter is not yet implemented in scikit-learn, and thus, if the script runs without error, it likely means that the feature has been implemented or that the `SplineTransformer` definition has changed since the time of writing."
