Certainly! Here is a standalone Python script that attempts to reproduce the described issue within a simplified Django setup. This script includes a minimal Django configuration, a simple model, a view that retrieves an object based on a slug using `get_object_or_404`, and generates an `AssertionError` if the behavior does not match what you're expecting due to the presence of `SimpleLazyObject`. 

Please ensure that Django is appropriately installed in your environment before running this script, and note that you will need to adjust certain configurations according to your project's specific paths or requirements.

Before running this script, make sure:

- Django is installed in your environment (`pip install django`).
- Update the secret key `SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'` with an appropriate value for your setup.
- Adjust the database settings if needed.

This script initializes a Django application, configures a minimal environment, and runs a test to replicate the described behavior. If the issue is present, it attempts to raise an `AssertionError` or prints the stack trace of any unexpected Exception encountered.
