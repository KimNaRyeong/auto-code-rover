        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure that it can handle SimpleLazyObject by forcing the evaluation of such objects before attempting to quote them for SQLite. The intended behavior is to detect instances of SimpleLazyObject (or more generally, lazy objects) among the parameters and evaluate them to their respective primitive types (like strings) that SQLite can handle. This would prevent the Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type error by ensuring that all parameters passed to SQLite are of supported types. Modification can be implemented in the parameter preprocessing step before executing the query."
