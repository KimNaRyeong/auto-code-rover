Ensure you have Sphinx installed in your Python environment (`pip install Sphinx`).\n2. Place this script in the root directory of a Sphinx documentation project. If it's a brand-new project, you can create one quickly by running `sphinx-quickstart` and following the prompts.\n3. Run the script with Python 3 using the command from the problem statement, `python3 reproducer.py`.\n4. This script will generate a minimal Sphinx configuration and a single `index.rst` file containing a documented Python function. It then builds the documentation and attempts to validate the presence of the expected fragment identifier in the generated HTML file based on the described issue.\n5. If the issue is present, meaning the expected anchor uses underscores instead of dashes, the script will exit with code 1, printing the problematic part of the code. Otherwise, it reports success. \n\nThis should facilitate reproducing the reported issue with Python domain IDs breaking changes in Sphinx."
