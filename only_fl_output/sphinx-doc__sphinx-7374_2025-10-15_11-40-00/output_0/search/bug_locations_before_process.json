One approach could involve adding a configuration option to the Sphinx project settings that allows the user to specify the desired behavior (underscore or dash in identifiers). This option would then be checked in relevant PythonDomain methods to determine how identifiers are formatted. An alternative or additional approach might involve methods within PythonDomain that ensure any generated links are appropriately redirected or aliased, so that both underscore and dash variants of a fragment identifier would resolve to the correct location."
