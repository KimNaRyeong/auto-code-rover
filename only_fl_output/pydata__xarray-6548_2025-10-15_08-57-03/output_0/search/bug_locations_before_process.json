        "intended_behavior": "The `polyval` function should have enhanced handling for when `coord.name` is `None`. Before calling `get_clean_interp_index`, the function could set an implicit or default name based on the dimension if not already named. This allows for evaluating polynomials even when coordinates are manually constructed without names, thereby improving usability without compromising existing functionality. Alternatively, improving error messaging to guide users on naming their coordinates could be considered."

        "intended_behavior": "The method should better handle cases where `dim` is `None`, which occurs when `coord.name` is not set. This enhancement could involve a more explicit check early in the method to ensure that a valid `dim` (or `coord.name` in the context of its use in `polyval`) is provided, falling back to a sensible default or raising a more informative error. This change aims to prevent the `KeyError` encountered and make the function more robust against unnamed coordinate inputs."
