</code><intended_behavior>The method `get_aggregation` is responsible for deciding whether to use a subquery for the aggregation based on various conditions, including the presence of limits, distinct usage, or existing annotations. To resolve the issue at hand, the method needs a refined logic that ensures the necessary `INNER JOIN` for fields inherited from a base model is preserved when processing aggregation queries like `count()` on an annotated queryset. The current logic, where `inner_query.default_cols` is set to `False` potentially dropping essential joins, needs to adjust to: 1. Correctly identify cases where joins are essential for the correct computation of aggregation queries involving annotated fields that reference inherited model fields. 2. Maintain these joins without disrupting the intended optimizations for cases where such preservation isn't necessary. The adjustment should ensure that when an annotated queryset (especially using `RawSQL`) references fields from a base model, the framework retains the necessary joins for accurate aggregation calculation, thereby preventing errors like the one reported. This would involve a more nuanced condition around the modification of `inner_query.default_cols` and `inner_query.group_by` settings, specifically ensuring that the changes do not inadvertently drop required `INNER JOIN` statements in queries involving inherited fields. This adjustment would preserve the existing functionality while also accommodating the correct handling of annotated querysets referencing inherited fields.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
