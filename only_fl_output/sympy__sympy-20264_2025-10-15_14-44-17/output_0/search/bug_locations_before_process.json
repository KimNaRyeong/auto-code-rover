        "intended_behavior": "The method should be modified to handle cases where the expression is of the form `Pow(Rational(1,n), -1, evaluate=False)` without causing infinite recursion. This might involve adding an additional conditional check to correctly process and return the LaTeX string for expressions with a negative exponent and where `evaluate=False`. Ensure that it correctly formats such expressions into a `\\frac{1}{...}` format without erroneously delegating back to `_print_Mul`, possibly by directly constructing the LaTeX string for these special cases."

        "method": "_print_Mul",
        "intended_behavior": "This method should include a more robust handling mechanism for expressions that involve division or negative powers, which are not naturally handled as multiplication by sympy but can fall back to this method due to the way sympy structures expressions. Specifically, the method should ensure it does not inadvertently cause a loop when encountering expressions that have been structured to avoid evaluation or when simplifications that normally occur are bypassed with `evaluate=False`. It may involve refining the logic that decides when to use fractional representation versus straightforward multiplication, especially in edge cases identified by the issue description."
