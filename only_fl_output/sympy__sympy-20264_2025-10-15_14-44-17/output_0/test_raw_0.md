When executed, this script attempts to reproduce the reported issue within a Sympy environment. Should the issue be present, it will catch a `RecursionError` during the execution of the latex function with a specific sympy expression. The script uses a custom `print_stacktrace` function to display the error trace more clearly. If the error is caught, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating the presence of the bug. Conversely, if the issue has been fixed and no error occurs, the script will complete successfully and print a message indicating the absence of the reported issue, then exit with code 0.
