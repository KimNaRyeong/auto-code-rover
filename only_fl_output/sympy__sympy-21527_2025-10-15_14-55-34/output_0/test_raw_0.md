This script will reproduce the issue where `sympy.linsolve` fails to give the same solution for all three systems of equations. It uses `assert` statements to check if the outputs are what's expected (all zeroes, indicating no solution or trivial solution).

- It runs three tests with slightly differing coefficients in one of the equations to see if `sympy.linsolve` can handle the equations consistently.
- If the results don't match the expected output of `(0,0)` for all three sets (which theoretically should be correct since both equations in each set essentially describe the same line), an `AssertionError` will be thrown.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is used to clearly output where the error occurred if the assertions fail.

Remember, this script depends on `sympy` being installed in your Python environment. Run `pip install sympy` if it's missing.
