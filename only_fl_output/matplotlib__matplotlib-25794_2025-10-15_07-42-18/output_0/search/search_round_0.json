        "content": "<issue>Raise when both singular and plural scatter attributes are specified\n### Problem\n`plt.scatter` accepts both singular and plural forms of the `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` attributes. The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

This call will help us find the file(s) where the method is defined or overridden if it exists in multiple classes or modules.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"scatter\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for code snippets that handle `linewidths` and `edgecolors` attributes**: Given the issue mentions both singular and plural forms (`linewidth`, `linewidths`, `edgecolor`, `edgecolors`), searching for these attribute names in the codebase can help us identify where these are being processed or checked. This information is crucial for understanding the current handling mechanism and where the proposed validation (raising an exception when both forms are used) could be implemented.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"linewidths\")\n   search_code(\"edgecolors\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide an overview of how the `scatter` method interfaces with `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` attributes and where checks or modifications could be introduced to resolve the issue at hand."
