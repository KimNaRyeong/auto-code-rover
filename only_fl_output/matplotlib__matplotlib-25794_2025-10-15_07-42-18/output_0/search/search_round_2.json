The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

The two most relevant locations for addressing the issue at hand are likely `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` because these would contain the core definitions of the plotting functions that the users directly interact with. The mentions in `mpl_toolkits` might refer to 3D scatter plots, which could be affected by similar kwargs handling but are slightly less central to the issue described.\n\n2. **Usage of Linewidths and Edgecolors:**\n   - The `linewidths` and `edgecolors` snippets are found across several files, with significant concentrations in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` for `edgecolors`, and similarly, both attributes are mentioned extensively in `_axes.py` for `linewidths`. This suggests that the primary handling and validation of these kwargs likely occur within these sections of the code. The frequency and distribution of these attribute names indicate that they are integral to multiple plotting functions and configurations, potentially affecting not just scatter plots but other plot types as well.\n\n**Analytical Findings:**\n\n1. **Functionality and Relationship to the Bug:**\n   - The parts of the code where `scatter` is defined and where `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are used are crucial for controlling plot appearance. The issue stems from the code\u2019s ability to accept both singular and plural forms of these parameters without clear precedence or error handling when both are specified, leading to confusion and potential misuse.\n\n2. **Intended Behavior in Relation to the Issue:**\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be to either clearly define a precedence of singular over plural (or vice versa) or to introduce explicit error handling when both forms are provided by the user. This would help downstream libraries and their users to better understand and utilize the plotting functions without ambiguity. The existing precedents for argument handling and validation in other parts of matplotlib (such as with color parameters) suggest that adding specific checks for `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` is in line with the overall design philosophy of the library.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context and Potential Resolution:**\n\nTo move towards resolving the issue, it would be beneficial to dive deeper into how `scatter` is implemented within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`, as this file likely contains the core logic relevant to the problem. Specifically, seeing how the method differentiates or merges the handling of `linewidths` vs. `linewidth` and `edgecolors` vs. `edgecolor` would provide direct insight into where the proposed checks or warnings could be introduced. Additionally, examining any existing conditionals or validations around these parameters could offer a template or precedent for implementing the requested feature."

        "content": "1. **More Context Needed:**\n   - To address the issue effectively, it\u2019s crucial to analyze how the `scatter` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` handles the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` attributes specifically. Also, it would help to understand any existing logic for handling singular and plural kwargs to model the new checks or error messages after. Therefore, the following API call is necessary:\n     ```python\n     search_method_in_file(\"scatter\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     ```\n   - Additionally, to get an idea of how singular and plural forms are currently being processed or prioritized, a closer look at the code snippets where `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are directly referenced in the same file might be beneficial. This would help in forming a complete understanding of the existing logic:\n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"linewidths\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     search_code_in_file(\"edgecolors\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Where Are Bug Locations:**\n   - Given the current context, it's clear that necessary modifications will likely be focused on:\n     - **Location 1**:\n       - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`\n       - **Class and Method:** Wherever the `scatter` method is defined.\n       - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be updated to include logic that checks if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` are passed. If both are found, an exception should be raised to inform the user about the incorrect usage. This preserves the existing functionality while providing a clear directive to avoid ambiguity. The check should be mindful not to disrupt any existing logic that allows for either singular or plural forms to be used independently in a backward-compatible manner.\n   \n   These adjustments address the main concern of the issue \u2014 the ambiguity and potential confusion arising from accepting both singular and plural forms without clear guidance or handling. By instituting a clear error when both forms are used, users are directed towards consistent usage, reducing complexity and potential errors in downstream libraries."

Default values and behaviors are defined for these parameters, including conditions under which they interact with other settings like marker size and color.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe issue at hand involves the method's acceptance of both singular and plural forms of `linewidths` (`linewidth`) and `edgecolors` (`edgecolor`) without raising an error when both are provided. This can potentially lead to confusion among users about which attribute takes precedence and how to correctly specify these aesthetics for their scatter plots.\n\n1. **Parameter Precedence and Handling**: The method currently does not explicitly handle conflicts between singular and plural forms of these attributes. Given that both singular and plural forms are technically valid inputs, the method processes them without discrimination, which might not be the intended or expected behavior from an API design perspective.\n\n2. **Current Behavior and Documentation**: The method's documentation and its actual behavior possibly lack clarity regarding the use and precedence of singular vs. plural parameter forms, leading to the aforementioned confusion and misuse.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nTo resolve the issue, the intended behavior would involve introducing explicit checks or logic within the `scatter` method to:\n\n1. **Detect Conflicting Inputs**: Check for the simultaneous presence of both singular and plural forms of the `linewidths`/`linewidth` and `edgecolors`/`edgecolor` parameters. This detection mechanism should occur early in the method's parameter processing logic.\n\n2. **Raise a Clear Exception**: Upon detecting the presence of both forms for either parameter, the method should raise a meaningful exception that informs the user of the conflict and advises on correct usage. This would enforce clearer API usage and assist in avoiding ambiguity.\n\n3. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Any changes made should preserve backward compatibility for legitimate use cases, ensuring that existing code utilizing the `scatter` method (with singular or plural parameter forms, but not both simultaneously) remains functional. The resolution should strictly target the described issue without altering unrelated aspects of the method's behavior.\n\nImplementing these changes will directly address the reported user confusion and align the method's behavior with clearer, more predictable usage patterns."

If both forms of either parameter are detected, a `ValueError` should be raised with a message indicating that both forms cannot be used simultaneously and advising on the acceptable usage. This change aims to prevent user confusion by enforcing the use of only one form for each parameter, thus preserving the method's existing functionality while making it more user-friendly and less prone to errors. \n\n  Specifically, after the initial handling of the method's arguments but before any processing related to the appearance of the scatter plot markers (e.g., before line 4598), add:\n  \n  ```python\n  if ('linewidth' in kwargs and linewidths is not None) or ('edgecolor' in kwargs and edgecolors is not None):\n      raise ValueError(\"Both singular and plural forms of 'linewidths'/ 'linewidth' or 'edgecolors'/ 'edgecolor' cannot be used simultaneously. Please use either the singular or the plural form.\")\n  ```\n  \n  This check would efficiently prevent the core issue from occurring by providing immediate feedback to the user about misuse of the API, aligning with the principle of failing fast to avoid downstream errors or confusion.\n"
