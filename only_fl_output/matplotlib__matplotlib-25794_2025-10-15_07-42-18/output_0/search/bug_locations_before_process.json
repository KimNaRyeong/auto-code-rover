        "intended_behavior": "The `scatter` method should be modified to include checks at the beginning of its execution that determine if both singular and plural forms of the parameters `linewidths`/`linewidth` and `edgecolors`/`edgecolor` are provided. If both forms of either parameter are detected, a `ValueError` should be raised with a message indicating that both forms cannot be used simultaneously and advising on the acceptable usage. This change aims to prevent user confusion by enforcing the use of only one form for each parameter, thus preserving the method's existing functionality while making it more user-friendly and less prone to errors."
