This script attempts to reproduce the test failure outlined for the `test_evalf_fast_series` in the `sympy\concrete\tests\test_sums_products.py`. The script defines a custom function `print_stacktrace` to print the exception stack trace for better error analysis. It then tries to execute a piece of code that simulates the environment where NumPy is not installed and reproduces the `AssertionError` specified in your issue description.

The NumPy-free environment simulation is done by excluding any actual computations that would require NumPy directly. However, it's worth noting that this reproducible example focuses on just one of the mentioned tests for brevity and clear traceability of the issue within a standalone script context. Other test cases and failures mentioned would require similar handling, adapted to the specifics of each test's requirements and failure scenarios.
