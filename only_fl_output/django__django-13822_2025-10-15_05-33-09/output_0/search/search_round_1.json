The issue highlights a problem with Django's handling of `ManyToManyField` relationships, especially when models with identical names in different apps reference the same model using this field with a `related_name='+'`. Given this scenario, a good starting point is to:\n\n1. Look into any class that defines a `ManyToManyField` to see how they're implemented across various apps.\n2. Specifically investigate the implementation of models with identical names in different apps to understand the common pattern or implementation that might be causing this issue.\n3. Since the issue mentions the problem arises during migration creation, examining any migration-related code or methods that handle `ManyToManyField` relationships might also be useful.\n\nGiven these considerations, our search queries should aim to:\n\n- Find classes that define a `ManyToManyField`.\n- Check if there's any custom migration code that might be relevant to handling these fields or related names specifically.\n\nHere are the necessary API calls:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"ManyToManyField\")\nsearch_code(\"Meta\")\nsearch_code(\"related_name='+'\")\n```\n\nThese searches are kept broad to ensure we capture all relevant instances and patterns in the codebase that could contribute to understanding the issue fully."

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the search queries provides us with a broad overview of how `ManyToManyField` relationships are handled within the Django framework, where the Meta class is utilized across various parts of the framework, and where the specific `related_name='+'` attribute is mentioned in the context of disabling reverse accessors for model relationships. Let's break down each part:\n\n### 1. `ManyToManyField` search results\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `ManyToManyField` references scattered across files such as `related.py`, `admin/checks.py`, and various model and migration files highlight the framework's implementation and checks for many-to-many relationships between models, including how these are represented in the database schema, how they're serialized, and how the admin interface handles them.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The issue at hand involves `ManyToManyField` when models with the same name in different Django apps declare this field with `related_name='+'` to disable reverse relationships. The scattered nature of references suggests that the issue could stem from the inherent handling of these fields, particularly in generating migrations or the way Django's meta machinery interprets related names across different apps.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  Ideally, when `related_name='+'` is used, Django should seamlessly handle models with the same name across different apps without raising `fields.E305` errors during migration creation. It appears the intended mechanism to disregard reverse accessor setup is not functioning as expected in these specific scenarios.\n\n### 2. `Meta` class search results\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Meta` class in Django is used within models to provide model-specific options to Django's ORM. This includes table naming, ordering, abstract model declarations, and more. References in `models.py`, `admin/options.py`, and `migrations/state.py` likely indicate instructions for model behaviors and how migrations interpret these models.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  Although not directly related to the `ManyToManyField` issue, understanding how the `Meta` class influences model behavior is crucial. Given migrations are where the issue manifests, any `Meta` class-related configurations that affect migrations could be tangentially related, especially in terms of how related names and model uniqueness are handled across different apps.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  The `Meta` class should allow for configurations that enable models with the same name in different apps to coexist without migration issues, even when those models establish many-to-many relationships using `related_name='+'`.\n\n### 3. `related_name='+'` reference in `related_descriptors.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  This snippet explains the framework's provision for disabling reverse relation accessors through the use of `related_name='+'`. It highlights the underlying mechanism of using descriptors to manage model relations.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  Directly related to the issue, this part of the code provides insight into how Django intends to handle cases where reverse accessors are not needed or desired, which is precisely what's failing according to the issue's description. \n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  When `related_name='+'` is set, Django should not attempt to create reverse accessors, and thus, any mechanism that checks for clashing names or related names should not be triggered in a way that raises errors for models with the same name in different apps.\n\nGiven these insights, it appears the implementation or the internal checks around `related_names` might not fully account for `related_name='+'` in the context of identifying or ignoring name clashes across models in different apps during migration generation. Understanding how migrations are generated and how they handle `related_name='+'` specifically within the context of models with identical names across apps would be the next logical step in diagnosing the issue further."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The check that triggers this error needs to be adjusted so that it properly respects the intention behind `related_name='+'`, which is to avoid the creation of reverse relations. This should preserve the functionality of allowing models to explicitly not have reverse accessors and preventing the clash detection logic from flagging this as an error during migration generation.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that when `related_name='+'` is set, the framework correctly handles relations without generating reverse accessors, especially in scenarios with models of the same name in different apps. Since this file deals with the descriptors that manage these relations, it's crucial to verify that `related_name='+'` effectively disables reverse relation checks or name clashes in the migrations' logic.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, which involves the handling of migrations and model relationships, the fix should ensure compatibility with existing Django applications and not introduce breaking changes. Adjustments should specifically target the migration generation process's handling of `related_name='+'` in the context of `ManyToManyField` relationships, ensuring that the declared intention of the developer, to not have reverse relations for certain fields, is respected without causing unnecessary errors."
