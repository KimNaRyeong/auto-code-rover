        "content": "To gather the required context for resolving the issue, let's identify the components and elements mentioned in the issue description that we need more information on. The issue highlights a problem with Django's handling of `ManyToManyField` relationships, especially when models with identical names in different apps reference the same model using this field with a `related_name='+'`. Given this scenario, a good starting point is to:\n\n1. Look into any class that defines a `ManyToManyField` to see how they're implemented across various apps.\n2. Specifically investigate the implementation of models with identical names in different apps to understand the common pattern or implementation that might be causing this issue.\n3. Since the issue mentions the problem arises during migration creation, examining any migration-related code or methods that handle `ManyToManyField` relationships might also be useful.\n\nGiven these considerations, our search queries should aim to:\n\n- Find classes that define a `ManyToManyField`.\n- Check if there's any custom migration code that might be relevant to handling these fields or related names specifically.\n\nHere are the necessary API calls:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"ManyToManyField\")\nsearch_code(\"Meta\")\nsearch_code(\"related_name='+'\")\n```\n\nThese searches are kept broad to ensure we capture all relevant instances and patterns in the codebase that could contribute to understanding the issue fully."
