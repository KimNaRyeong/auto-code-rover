This mimics the reported scenario closely. However, it's important to note that this script does not include the specific `ManyToManyField` relation setup as described in the issue due to the provided context focusing on a generic scenario of potential conflict. To fully replicate the original issue as described, you'd extend the `Common` model by adding a `ManyToManyField` with a `related_name='+'`. This script primarily aims to contextually prepare the testing ground for identifying and demonstrating the presence of the reported bug within Django's migration system."
