Here are the API calls we can make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Mul` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that could be involved in the conversion to LaTeX.\n   - `search_class(\"Mul\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))` gives an incorrect output, we need to find the definition of the `latex` function which handles the conversion to LaTeX.\n   - `search_method(\"latex\")`\n\n3. Additionally, it could be helpful to look into how `evaluate=False` is handled within the `Mul` class to see if there's a specific code path that leads to the issue observed.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"doit\", \"Mul\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the involved components and help pinpoint where the issue might originate from in the project's codebase."
