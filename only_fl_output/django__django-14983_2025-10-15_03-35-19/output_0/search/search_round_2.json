The `MigrationAutodetector` class is evidently central to Django's migration system, particularly in detecting changes in models that necessitate the generation of new migrations.\n\n### Analysis of the `MigrationAutodetector` Class\n\n1. **Responsibilities**: The `MigrationAutodetector` class is tasked with detecting model changes that require new migrations. It contains methods for generating a variety of migrations, including creating and deleting models, adding and removing fields, and altering model options. This functionality indicates that it plays a critical role in analyzing the current state of models compared to their last migration state and determining what new migrations should be made.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The bug is related to how new migration files are numbered, especially in the presence of squashed migrations. Although `MigrationAutodetector` does not directly deal with the file naming or numbering, it is involved in the process that leads up to that point\u2014the detection of changes and the preparation of migration actions. Understanding how `MigrationAutodetector` works can provide insights into where the numbering logic might get its input and how the presence of squashed migrations might affect that logic.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue, the intended behavior would be for the migration system to correctly sequence new migrations after the highest numbered existing migration, including those that result from squashing. This implies an understanding and analysis of the existing migration graph, determining the highest current migration, and appropriately naming new migrations in sequence, regardless of squashes.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, it appears we need to look closer into how migrations are sequenced and named after being detected. Since the direct search for `makemigrations` and `generate_migration_name` methods yielded no results, we should consider a more indirect approach. We need to understand how Django tracks and manages the chain of migrations, especially in the context of squashed migrations. This would likely involve the management of migration dependencies and the generation of migration files themselves.\n\nSuggested API Calls for Further Investigation:\n\n1. **Investigate Migration Naming or Sequencing Logic**: Since the `makemigrations` command did not lead us to a direct method, we should look for methods that deal with arranging migrations, managing dependencies, or the final step of writing migration files, which could potentially involve naming.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"arrange_for_graph\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"generate_migration_files\", \"django/db/migrations/writer.py\")  # Hypothetical method name\n```\n\n2. **Explore Migration File Generation**: Understanding how files themselves are generated and named could provide further insights. We assume that the file naming logic might be in a separate module responsible for the actual file output.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"MigrationWriter\")\n```\n\nThese steps aim to pinpoint the mechanism responsible for attributing numbers to migrations, especially in cases where squashed migrations may impact the expected numbering sequence."

Therefore, I will hypothesize based on the typical workflow of Django's migration system:\n\nLocation 1:\n- **File:** `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- **Class:** `MigrationAutodetector`\n- **Method:** `arrange_for_graph`\n- **Intended Behavior:** This method should ensure that when determining the graph arrangement for new migrations, it accurately accounts for squashed migrations. Specifically, it should always sequence new migrations by considering the highest numbered migration as the starting point, including both squashed and non-squashed migrations. This would mean enhancing the logic to recognize when a squashed migration encompasses other migrations and ensuring the numbering of subsequent migrations reflects the true latest point in the migration graph.\n\nLocation 2:\n- **File:** Not precisely identified yet (hypothetically `django/db/migrations/writer.py` or similar)\n- **Class:** `MigrationWriter` (or the class responsible for generating the migration file)\n- **Intended Behavior:** If this class or its equivalent exists, and is responsible for naming and writing the migration file to disk, it should implement logic that correctly identifies the next sequential migration number in the context of existing and squashed migrations. This means either augmenting how migration names are generated to ensure they follow sequentially after the highest numbered migration (accounting for squashes), or ensuring that the interpretation of the current migration environment accurately reflects the squashed migrations.\n\nIn summary, while specific bug locations need additional context for pinpointing, the intended behavior corrections focus on ensuring migration numbering considers the entire migration history accurately, especially in handling squashed migrations. This approach aims to maintain existing functionality while correcting the numbering sequence anomaly highlighted in the issue."

        "content": "With the provided data from the `MigrationWriter` class in `django/db/migrations/writer.py` and the detailed method `arrange_for_graph` found within `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, we can proceed to a deeper analysis. \n\n### Analysis of `MigrationWriter`\n\n1. **Functionality Overview**: The `MigrationWriter` class is responsible for converting migration objects into a string representation (presumably the actual migration file code) and handling the file writing process. This includes determining the base directory, filename, and path for the migration files, which are essential components for correctly naming and placing migration files.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: Although `MigrationWriter` itself does not directly decide the naming convention (numbering) of migrations, it is part of the pipeline that materializes the migrations into the filesystem. The filename property, likely derived from the migration's name property, implies that this class could be the endpoint where correct or incorrect naming decisions become manifest as actual file names.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior with the Issue in Mind**: To address the issue, `MigrationWriter` should correctly receive and process migration names that accurately represent their sequential order, even in the presence of squashed migrations. The actual fix might not be in `MigrationWriter` itself but ensuring that it gets the correctly sequenced name is paramount.\n\n### Analysis of `arrange_for_graph` Method in `MigrationAutodetector`\n\n1. **Functionality Overview**: This method modifies the names and dependencies of migrations to fit into an existing migration graph, which is crucial for determining the sequential order of new migrations. It ensures that new migrations extend the graph from the current leaf nodes for each app, which involves calculating the next migration number based on the last known migration.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: This method's functionality is directly related to the issue as it includes logic for determining the \"next number in the sequence\" of migrations. It looks like it calculates the next migration number based on the app's current leaf node in the migration graph. If this calculation does not correctly account for squashed migrations or if it misinterprets the current state because of them, it would lead to the generation of incorrectly numbered migrations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior in the Context of the Bug**: The `arrange_for_graph` should ensure that when it calculates the next migration number, it comprehensively considers both squashed and unsquashed migrations to prevent duplicate or out-of-sequence migration numbering. This means possibly refining the logic that determines the app's current leaf node in the context of squashed migrations to ensure the next number accurately reflects the total number of migrations that should logically exist. \n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe issue seems to stem from how the migration numbering sequence is calculated in the presence of squashed migrations. The critical locus for fixing this issue appears to be within the `arrange_for_graph` method of the `MigrationAutodetector` class, where migration sequence numbers are determined. Any amendment to address the issue would likely involve refining how this method considers squashed migrations when calculating the sequence number for new migrations.\n\nTherefore, based on these insights, the next steps could include designing a patch or adjustment to the `arrange_for_graph` method to ensure it accurately sequences migrations, even when squashed migrations are present. This involves potentially adding logic to better handle the enumeration and recognition of squashed migrations as part of the migration history."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Specifically, in the logic that determines the next number in the sequence, there should be an explicit check or consideration for squashed migrations. The method must ensure that the sequence number of a new migration reflects the total count of existing migrations, including those squashed, to avoid numbering collisions or sequencing errors. This might involve an enhancement in how the current leaf node (or nodes, in the case of squashed migrations) is determined and how the sequence numbers are incremented from there.\n\nThis adjustment ensures that new migrations are correctly sequenced, directly addressing the issue where `makemigrations` generates a \"wrong\" numbered migration file if squashed migrations are in place. The fix preserves existing functionality by maintaining the integrity of the migration graph and ensuring that new migrations continue to correctly extend from the leaf nodes for each app, with an improved consideration for squashed migrations within the sequencing logic."
