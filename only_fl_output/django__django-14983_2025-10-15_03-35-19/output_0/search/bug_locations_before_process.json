        "intended_behavior": "The method should be refined to ensure it accurately accounts for both squashed and non-squashed migrations when calculating the sequence number for new migrations. Specifically, in the logic that determines the next number in the sequence, there should be an explicit check or consideration for squashed migrations. The method must ensure that the sequence number of a new migration reflects the total count of existing migrations, including those squashed, to avoid numbering collisions or sequencing errors. This might involve an enhancement in how the current leaf node (or nodes, in the case of squashed migrations) is determined and how the sequence numbers are incremented from there."
