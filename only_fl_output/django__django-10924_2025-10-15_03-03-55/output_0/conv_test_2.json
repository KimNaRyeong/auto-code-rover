Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"

        "content": "Given the feedback and the goal of reproducing an issue specifically related to `FilePathField` not accepting a callable for its `path` argument, a more appropriate approach is necessary. The previous script attempted to dynamically set up Django, which can lead to complexities beyond the core issue you're facing. Here's an updated standalone script that should more directly target the reproduction of the issue. This script assumes you have a basic Django setup and aims to provoke the `AssertionError` if the `FilePathField` cannot handle a callable as expected.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\n\n# Function to return the path, acting as a callable for FilePathField\ndef dynamic_path():\n    return os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'example_dir')\n\n# Minimal Django settings necessary for this script to run\nsettings.configure(\n    BASE_DIR=os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'db.sqlite3'),\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],  # Treat this __main__ module as an app\n    SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key-for-testing',\n    USE_I18N=False,\n    USE_L10N=False,\n    USE_TZ=False,\n)\n\n# Dynamically creating a model class to use in tests\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    file = models.FilePathField(path=dynamic_path)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = '__main__'\n\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n\ntry:\n    # Dynamically add the TestModel to the current app\n    models.signals.class_prepared.send(sender=TestModel)\n\n    # Attempt to create migrations for the models in this script\n    # This should raise an error if FilePathField cannot handle a callable for path\n    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False, dry_run=True, name='test_migration')\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    raise AssertionError(\"Django FilePathField does not accept callable for dynamic path resolution.\") from e\n\nprint(\"Test passed: `FilePathField` accepts a callable without errors.\")\n```\n\nThis script aims to trigger an `AssertionError` if `FilePathField` cannot accept a callable for its `path` argument, by integrating directly with Django's model and migration system. To utilize this script:\n\n1. Ensure you have a Django project setup where this script could be run.\n2. Adjust any configurations as necessary, particularly around where it assumes the Django project's settings and database configuration.\n3. This script assumes it's being run in an environment where Django is installed and configured to run standalone scripts.\n\nRemember, you'll also need to ensure your Django project's environment is properly activated (if using virtual environments) before running the script for accurate testing."
