Instead, if the object it is comparing to is not a Django Model, it automatically returns False.\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/models/base.py#L526\nAccording to the Python 3 data model reference, a __eq__ should return NotImplemented\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__\nIf a.__eq__(b) returns NotImplemented, then b.__eq__(a) will be tried. If both return NotImplemented, then an is check is performed, and if that fails it returns False.\nThis may seem like a relatively innocuous difference, but it can cause some nasty bugs. The most obvious is that for testing,\n<A Django Model> == mock.ANY returns False, since by not returning NotImplemented it never even looks at the overridden __eq__ on ANY.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue correctly, let's perform the following API calls for gathering necessary code context:\n\n1. First, we need to find the `__eq__` method within the `Model` class from Django's code base. Since the issue mentions this directly, we need the exact implementation detail:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"Model\")`\n\n2. Since the issue references a specific line in a file (though it may be outdated, it's a start), we need to see the current code around that area to understand how `__eq__` is implemented currently in the `Model` class. Assuming the file is `django/db/models/base.py`, and the line number could have changed, let's get a broader context around the mentioned line. We do not have the exact current line number, so this approach is speculative without checking the actual file first:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Model\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")` to locate the class and potentially narrow down where `__eq__` might be.\n   \n3. Lastly, to understand the exact issue with the current implementation not returning `NotImplemented` when comparison fails, it would be beneficial to see if there are any checks already in place for handling types or any precedent for returning `NotImplemented` in similar scenarios:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"return False\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")` to find instances where `False` is returned directly, which might include our case.\n\nThese calls will provide the necessary context to understand the current implementation of the `__eq__` method within the `Model` class, how it compares instances, and to identify the correct spot to possibly introduce a fix for the described issue."
