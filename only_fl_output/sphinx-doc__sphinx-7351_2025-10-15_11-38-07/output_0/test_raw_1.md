To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue as described, we need a script that sets up a minimal Sphinx project, creates the necessary files, and asserts the behavior when building the documentation. We will simulate the issue by creating `index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst`, and then run Sphinx programmatically within the script to build the documentation. To validate the issue, we'll check if `a.md` was ignored in favor of `a.rst`, counter to the expectation set in `index.rst`.

```python

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script does the following:
- Sets up a minimal Sphinx project with the specified `index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst` files.
- Attempts to build the Sphinx documentation.
- Checks the generated HTML for `a` to determine if `a.md` or `a.rst` was included incorrectly.
- Raises an `AssertionError` with a stack trace if the issue is present, indicating `a.rst` was included instead of `a.md` as specified.

It assumes Sphinx and `myst-parser` are installed in the environment where itâ€™s executed. If the issue is fixed and Sphinx correctly includes `a.md` when specified in the `toctree`, the script will exit with code `0` and no exception will be raised.
