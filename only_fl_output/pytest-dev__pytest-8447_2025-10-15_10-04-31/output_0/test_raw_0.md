Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to programmatically attempt to trigger the reported issue, raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or printing a relevant message and exiting with code 0 if the issue has been fixed.

Please note, this script assumes a setup where `pytest`, `pytest-black`, `pytest-checkdocs`, and potentially other related dependencies are installed in the environment where the script is executed. Additionally, this is a somewhat simplified representation as fully replicating the issue may involve more intricate setup or dependency resolution that isn't feasible in a single script. Adjustments might be needed to match your specific project structure or dependencies.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_issue():
    # Attempt to mimic the environment and call that led to the issue.
    test_file_name = 'test_something.py'
    with open(test_file_name, 'w') as f:
        pass  # Create an empty test file.

    # Note: the command below might need to be adjusted based on the environment/setup.
    command = ['pytest', '--black']
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
        # We look for the specific TypeError in stderr to determine if the issue is present.
        if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in result.stderr:
            return True, result.stderr
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    return False, ""

def main():
    issue_detected, stderr = check_for_issue()
    if issue_detected:
        print("Issue detected. Plugin incompatibility or misconfiguration found.", file=sys.stderr)
        print(stderr, file=sys.stderr)
        raise AssertionError("The issue related to unexpected keyword argument 'path' is still present.")
    else:
        print("No issue detected. The problem seems to have been resolved.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script primarily focuses on detecting the presence of the reported `TypeError` issue through the invocation of `pytest` with the `--black` flag, as described in the issue report. When the problem is detected, an `AssertionError` is raised along with the stack trace of the issue, which is elicited using the `print_stacktrace` function. If the problem described in the issue is not present (either due to a change in any of the involved software packages or an update that fixes the issue), the script will exit with a success status code (`0`) and print a message indicating the absence of the issue.
