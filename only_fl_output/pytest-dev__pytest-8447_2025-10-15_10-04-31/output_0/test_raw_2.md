To tailor a `reproducer.py` script to the specific requirement — reproducing an issue linked to `pytest` plugins (`pytest-black` or `pytest-checkdocs`) encountering unexpected keyword arguments, such as 'path' — we need a slightly different approach from previously discussed. Given the objective, this code aims to simulate the environment mentioned and invoke features within those plugins that lead to the reported error.

Please note that addressing the error precisely as described would necessitate replicating a specific interaction between `pytest` and the mentioned plugins in a controlled script. The actual resolution for the reported error would likely involve updates or fixes to those plugins to handle new `pytest` API changes or vice versa. This illustrative script assumes executing some steps to elicit the described bug through the scripted interaction with these tools.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_with_plugin(plugin):
    """
    Attempts to run pytest with the specified plugin and checks for the TypeError
    related to the 'path' argument. Raises an error if the issue is detected.
    """
    # Creating a dummy test file to simulate a real pytest execution context
    test_file_name = 'test_dummy.py'
    with open(test_file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write('def test_dummy():\n    pass\n')

    try:
        # Assume running a pytest command directly from Python may surface the error.
        # We include a call to a hypothetical plugin via '-p' argument to pytest
        command = [sys.executable, '-m', 'pytest', '-p', plugin]
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

        # Check output and error streams for hints of the problem
        if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in result.stderr:
            raise Exception("Detected the TypeError related to 'path'. Issue is present.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as cpe:
        # If the subprocess itself failed, that may be our hint.
        if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in cpe.stderr:
            raise Exception("Detected the TypeError related to 'path'. Issue is present.")
        else:

            print("Subprocess failed, but not due to the targeted issue.")
            raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit to indicate the script caught the TypeError

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Assuming we'd test both plugins; this could be looped or parameterized based on needs
        test_with_plugin('pytest-black')
        test_with_plugin('pytest-checkdocs')
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # AssertionError or any other exception should indicate the presence of the issue.
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        # If no exception was raised, we assume the issue was not reproduced
        print("Issue was not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script provides a foundation to experiment with reproducing the specific issue in your environment. Depending on the intricacies of how `pytest`, `pytest-black`, and `pytest-checkdocs` interact with each other and with the testing environment (e.g., specific versions, configurations, etc.), additional adjustments might be necessary to fully replicate the behavior leading to the `TypeError`.
