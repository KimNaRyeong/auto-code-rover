This script assumes that you have a Django project setup with Django app(s) and the given models (`User`, `Post`, and others as defined in the original issue). Before running the script:
- Replace `'your_project_name.settings'` with the actual path to your Django project settings module.
- Replace `'your_app_name.models'` with the actual path to where your models are defined in your Django app.

Using this script will help in reproducing the issue described. It creates necessary user and post instances then attempts to execute the annotation query that was causing failures. If the problem persists, the script will print a stack trace of the exception and raise an `AssertionError`. If there are no errors, the script indicates that the problem might have been resolved, which could happen if the issue was fixed in a patch or newer Django version than 4.1.1.
