To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that can reproduce the issue without needing to dynamically setup a Django environment within the script, you'll need to ensure that the Django environment is properly configured outside the script, i.e., it assumes that the Django settings are already configured when this script is run. 

This means you should run this script in an environment where Django's command-line tools can be used, and the Django project is setup correctly. If necessary, you can set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable appropriately before running the script, or make sure you're working in a virtual environment where the Django project settings are automatically detected.

The provided script includes a custom Django model setup based on your descriptions and attempts to reproduce the issue with `QuerySet.annotate()` method. Adjust the script with your actual model paths and settings module:

```python
"""
reproducer.py
This script is designed to reproduce a specific issue with Django's QuerySet.annotate() method.
"""
import os
import django

# Setup Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')
django.setup()

import sys
from django.db.models import Count, Exists, OuterRef, Prefetch, Value, Case, When
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

User = get_user_model()

# Define your models and manager here or import them if they are defined elsewhere
class PostManager(models.Manager):
    def fetch_all_posts(self, request_user):
        # You need to customize the method implementation according to your actual use case
        pass

class Post(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="posts")
    liked_by = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name="liked_posts", blank=True)
    
    objects = PostManager()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        User = get_user_model()
        test_user = User.objects.create(username="test_user")

        # Reproduce the issue
        Post.objects.create(user=test_user, text="Test Post")
        posts = Post.objects.fetch_all_posts(test_user)
        if not posts.exists():
            raise AssertionError("Expected at least one post!")
        
        print("Reproduction of the issue was not successful. The issue might have been resolved.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Important Modifications Needed:**

1. Ensure `your_project_name.settings` is replaced with the actual settings module path of your Django project.
2. If your models are defined in specific applications, import them directly instead of redefining them in the script.
3. Implement the `fetch_all_posts` method according to your application's logic. The provided example is just a placeholder and won't work without proper implementation.

This script assumes you've properly set up your Django models and environment. It tries to simulate the problematic operation and should report an error as described if the issue still exists.
