        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cols` method's existing functionality is to ensure that each column's datatype from an ECSV file is supported within the Astropy framework. To resolve the issue, this method should be updated to include `datetime64` in the list of acceptable datatypes or to apply a more flexible approach when handling datatypes, particularly those that are common in the context of time series data. The update should aim to allow `datetime64` columns to be read from ECSV files without raising a `ValueError`. This could be accomplished by:\n- Extending the `ECSV_DATATYPES` list to include `datetime64`, thus directly supporting it in ECSV files.\n- Implementing a conditional check for `datetime64` that appropriately handles it as a special case, possibly converting it into a supported format internally while not altering the user-facing API.\n\nThe adjustment should preserve all existing functionalities, ensuring that files previously readable remain so, and extend the capability to include files containing `datetime64` columns, reinstating backward compatibility with files created in earlier versions of Astropy."
