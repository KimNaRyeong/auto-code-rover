It appears there was a misunderstanding in my previous response due to the context of the execution environment error, which did not align directly with the issue at hand. To clarify, if you're looking to reproduce the issue regarding `decode_cf` failing when `scale_factor` is a length-1 list in xarray versions after 0.16.1, please ensure that your environment is correctly set up with a compatible xarray version and dependencies. Here's an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py` considering the execution context you've described:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import xarray as xr
    ds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',
                      attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],
                             'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()
    xr.decode_cf(ds)
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
except AttributeError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # You can choose to raise AssertionError if that fits your test suite better.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue as originally described, capturing any `AttributeError` that arises from the use of `decode_cf` with attributes as length-1 lists. If such an error is caught, a detailed stack trace is printed, utilizing the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clarity on error origins. Exiting with code 1 upon errors signifies the script's outcome, illustrating whether the issue persists or not under the test conditions.
