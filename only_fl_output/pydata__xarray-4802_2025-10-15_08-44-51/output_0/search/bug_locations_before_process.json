        "intended_behavior": "The method should first check if `scale_factor` and `add_offset` are list instances and, if so, handle them appropriately by selecting the first item for length-1 lists before applying any operations that assume scalar values. This modification ensures that if either `scale_factor` or `add_offset` are provided as length-1 lists, the method treats them equivalently to scalars, thereby preserving the existing functionality while also accommodating datasets where these attributes are encoded as length-1 lists. Specifically, the code that currently directly attempts to use `.item()` on `scale_factor` and `add_offset` should be wrapped in a conditional block that checks for the type of these variables and correctly extracts their value if they are list objects. This adjustment maintains the method's purpose to scale and offset variable data according to CF conventions without failing when encountering a list format."
