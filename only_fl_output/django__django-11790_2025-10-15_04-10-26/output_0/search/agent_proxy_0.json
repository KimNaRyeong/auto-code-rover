            "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the `AuthenticationForm`'s `username` field not setting the `maxlength` HTML attribute, we need to understand where and how `AuthenticationForm` is defined and used. Based on the issue description, this problem may involve looking into the form's definition and perhaps where the username field specifically is handled or modified, especially in relation to the mentioned regression.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to collect the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `AuthenticationForm` class to find which file it's defined in:\n   - `search_class(\"AuthenticationForm\")`\n\n2. Since the regression was introduced in a specific commit (5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13), it's important to check any code changes related to `AuthenticationForm` or its `username` field around this commit. However, understanding we cannot search directly by commit in these API calls, we should at least find where the username field is defined or manipulated within `AuthenticationForm`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"AuthenticationForm\", \"__init__\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean_username\", \"AuthenticationForm\")`\n\n3. Lastly, it might be beneficial to look for any explicit mention of the `maxlength` attribute being set or modified for the `username` field in the entire codebase, to understand how it was previously handled and where the regression might have occurred:\n   - `search_code(\"maxlength\")`\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of where the issue might lie within the codebase, focusing on the authentication form's structure and any recent changes that could have affected the `maxlength` attribute handling for the username field."
