        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to use `select_template` whenever the template to be included is specified as a list of possible templates. The current implementation utilizes `get_template`, which does not support lists and can only handle a single template name. To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the method should: Check if the resolved template variable (`self.template.resolve(context)`) is a list. If it is a list, use `select_template` instead of `get_template` to select the first existing template from the list. Ensure that the original single-template functionality remains unchanged for backward compatibility. This means keeping the logic for when a single template name is resolved (not a list), it should still use `get_template` as it currently does. All other aspects of the `render` method should remain the same, ensuring that template rendering still respects the current context or a new, isolated context if specified by `self.isolated_context`."
