        "intended_behavior": "The `plot` method should ensure that markers defined by mathtext are correctly center-aligned. This might require adjusting the interpretation of mathtext within the plotting logic, specifically where marker positions are calculated. The change should ensure that the coordinates of mathtext markers are adjusted such that they appear centered at the specified plot points, without altering the behavior for non-mathtext markers. This might involve a condition check for mathtext markers and applying an alignment correction based on the marker size and possibly the bounding box of the rendered text."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that rendering of mathtext is likely handled within Text handling functionalities, any method responsible for rendering text (including `draw` if applicable) should ensure mathtext is centered based on its rendered size. If the issue stems from how the bounding box of mathtext is calculated or interpreted, this method might need to be adjusted to consider the actual visual center of mathtext symbols. Changes here should ensure that when mathtext is used as a marker, the alignment visually appears centered at the specified data points, while maintaining existing functionalities for rendering regular text across the library."
