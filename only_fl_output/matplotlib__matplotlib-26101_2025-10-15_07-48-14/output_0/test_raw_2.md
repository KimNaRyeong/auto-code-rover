To craft a script that specifically checks for the claimed alignment issue with Matplotlib's mathtext markers, we can draw inspiration from previous discussions and attempt a clear-cut approach. Recognizing the limitations in programmatically assessing visual alignment without direct attribute comparison (due to possible differences in internal handling of marker paths between standard and mathtext markers), we can analyze the bounding box of the rendered figure or visually inspect the output. However, for the sake of this automated script, we will rely on a heuristic check and the assumption that if an alignment issue exists, it will affect the positioning in a significantly detectable manner.

Here's how `reproducer.py` can be structured:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_marker_alignment():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms

        # Prepare a figure
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.set_xlim([0, 20])
        ax.set_ylim([0, 20])

        # Standard star marker
        standard_marker, = ax.plot(10, 10, marker="*", markersize=25, linestyle='None')

        # Mathtext marker
        mathtext_marker, = ax.plot(15, 10, marker=r"$\star$", markersize=25, linestyle='None', color='r')

        # Draw the figure to access the rendered positions
        fig.canvas.draw()

        # Get the data-to-display transform
        transform = ax.transData

        # Get the display coordinates for standard and mathtext markers
        standard_display = transform.transform(standard_marker.get_data())
        mathtext_display = transform.transform(mathtext_marker.get_data())

        # Assuming alignment issues will significantly offset the markers, let's define a threshold
        alignment_threshold = 1.0  # in display units, arbitrarily chosen for demonstration

        # Calculate the distance between the two markers in display space
        distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(standard_display) - np.array(mathtext_display))

        assert distance <= alignment_threshold, f"Markers are misaligned by more than {alignment_threshold} display units."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # AssertionError indicates the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)  # Any other exception is unexpected
    else:
        print("Markers appear to be aligned within the defined threshold.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_marker_alignment()
```

This script aims to assess the alignment by comparing the positions of standard and mathtext markers in display space, which avoids direct, possibly unavailable attribute comparisons. It uses a simple distance calculation and asserts that if this distance exceeds a defined threshold, the issue is present. This approach bypasses the intricacies of marker rendering while focusing on the practical outcome of alignment, which was the original concern.
