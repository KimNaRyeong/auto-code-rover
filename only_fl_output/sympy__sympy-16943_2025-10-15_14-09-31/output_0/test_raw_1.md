Given the provided context and objectives, here's an updated version of the `reproducer.py` Python script designed to reproduce the described issue in a more accurate manner, considering the previous feedback. This script no longer attempts to import `FormalPowerSeries`, following the error message indicating such a class cannot be imported from `sympy`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, fps
    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        p = fps(x ** 2)
        # Since we are checking if fps DOESN'T always return a formal power series,
        # thus we need to assert on the wrong behavior that it returns x**2(a Pow object)
        # and does not support indexing as per the issue description.
        assert p == x**2, "Expected fps to return x**2 for this example"
        try:
            # Attempt to use the object in a way that would fail if it's not a formal power series
            _ = p[0]  # this should raise a TypeError if p is a 'Pow' object not supporting indexing
            print("Issue not reproduced: The result supports indexing, which is unexpected for a Pow object.")
        except TypeError:
            print("Issue reproduced successfully: Returned object does not support indexing.")
    except AssertionError as ex:
        print_stacktrace(ex)
        raise ex
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version checks specifically for the behavior described in the issue â€“ that the `fps` function does not always return a formal power series, as expected by the user, and when it doesn't (returning `x**2` in this case), it fails to support the same interface (like indexing), thus demonstrating the inconsistency/problem mentioned.
