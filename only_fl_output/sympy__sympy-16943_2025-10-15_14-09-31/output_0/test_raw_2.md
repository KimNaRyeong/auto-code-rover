To accurately reflect the requirement for reproducing the issue stated and integrating the feedback provided, here's the updated script `reproducer.py`. The objective is to demonstrate the inconsistency with the `fps` function from sympy and how it handles a polynomial such as `x**2`, which results in an object that doesn't fulfill the expected interface of a formal power series, particularly the support for indexing.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, fps
    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        p = fps(x ** 2)
        # Expecting `p` to be an instance of `FormalPowerSeries` if the issue is fixed,
        # but it is a `Pow` object due to the bug. We replace the expected behavior check with
        # a check that fails when the issue is present and passes when the issue is fixed.
        assert not isinstance(p, x.__class__), "fps should not return a Pow object for a polynomial."
        print("Test passed: fps returned an object that is not a simple Pow, potentially fixed the issue.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catching the AssertionError to print a custom stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        # For any other exception, print the stack trace and pass it along
        print("An unexpected error occurred, not directly related to the original issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will:
- Attempt to use `fps` with `x ** 2` and checks if the return value is not a simple power (`Pow`) object, aiming at the core of the issue where the expectation is for `fps` to return something that complies with the formal power series interface or similar, and not just a polynomial unchanged.
- Throw an `AssertionError` if the check fails, meaning the issue is still present if `fps` returns a simple `Pow` object.
- If the function returns a different object type (implying a potential fix or change in behavior), it prints a message indicating the test has passed, suggesting the issue might have been addressed.
- Utilizes the provided function `print_stacktrace` to offer detailed error information, enhancing debuggability.
