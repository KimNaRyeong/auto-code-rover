        "intended_behavior": "The `fps` method should be updated to ensure it returns a `FormalPowerSeries` object (or an object with a similar interface) for all types of inputs, including cases where the input is already in a form that does not require traditional series expansion (e.g., `x**2`). To achieve this, additional logic might be added to wrap the direct return values like `Pow` objects into a `FormalPowerSeries` object or another suitable structure that implements the same interface expected by users (support for indexing, arithmetic operations, etc.). This adjustment would ensure that regardless of the input's complexity or simplicity, the output consistently supports a predictable set of operations, aligning with the documented behavior and user expectations. The modification should be careful to preserve the functionality for cases that currently return a correct `FormalPowerSeries` object, only altering the behavior for cases that currently do not. This may involve checking the return type of `compute_fps` and wrapping it if necessary, before deciding to return `f` as is or as part of a formal series construct."
