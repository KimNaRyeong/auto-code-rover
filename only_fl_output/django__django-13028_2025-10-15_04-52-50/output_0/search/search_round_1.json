        "content": "Based on the search results, we have some insights and follow-up actions to get more context about the issue. Let's analyze the results we received:\n\n1. **Classes Not Found**:\n    - The search did not find the `ProductMetaDataType` and `ProductMetaData` classes in the codebase. This could mean that either these classes are dynamically defined (less likely in Django model definitions) or there might be typos or issues with the search queries.\n    - **Follow-up Action**: Double-check for any possible typos in the class names provided in the issue description. If there are none, consider broader search terms or searching for key methods or attributes (like `filterable`) related to these models.\n\n2. **Method `check_filterable` Found**:\n    - **What does this part of the code do?**\n      - The `check_filterable` method is part of Django's ORM layer (`django/db/models/sql/query.py`), designed to raise a `NotSupportedError` if an expression (in this context, a model field or an annotation) used in a filter operation is flagged as not filterable (`filterable=False`).\n    - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n      - The error encountered by the user is directly related to this method. The `NotSupportedError` being raised indicates that the `metadata_type` field (or related expression) is considered not filterable by Django's ORM, likely due to the `filterable` attribute being set to `False`.\n    - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n      - The intended behavior likely is to allow filtering on fields that are marked as `filterable`. With the misinterpretation or conflict caused by the custom `filterable` attribute in the user model `ProductMetaDataType`, there seems to be unintended interaction causing the ORM to treat the model field as non-filterable.\n\nGiven these reflections, the issue might stem from the ORM's behavior of considering custom model field attributes named `filterable` as instructions on whether the field can be used in filter operations. Django does not expect model fields to use `filterable` as a custom attribute name, which leads to the unexpected `NotSupportedError`.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. **Clarify Usage of `filterable` Attribute in Models**:\n    - Since direct searches for the models failed, a possible next step would be to search the codebase for mentions of the `filterable` attribute outside of the `ProductMetaDataType` context. This might reveal custom logic or other models using similar patterns that could further clarify the issue.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"filterable =\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Review Django ORM Documentation or Source Code**:\n    - Further review of Django's documentation or source code around query construction and filtering may shed light on reserved attribute names and their impact on model field behavior. This will not involve direct API calls but is an essential step in understanding the issue's root cause.\n\n3. **Investigate How `ProductMetaDataType` is Used in Queries**:\n    - Since the direct search for the usage of `metadata_type` in filter operations returned no results, it may be useful to look at how `ProductMetaDataType` is generally related or linked to `ProductMetaData` in the project, especially in query scenarios.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"ProductMetaDataType\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Manual Code Review**:\n    - A manual review of the files where `ProductMetaData` and `ProductMetaDataType` are defined could reveal insights missed by automated searches, such as dynamically constructed models or fields.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can gather more context on the issue and potentially identify both the cause of the `NotSupportedError` and avenues for resolving it."

However, it should do so in a way that recognizes and accommodates the possibility that developers might unknowingly use attribute names that conflict with Django's internal mechanics."
