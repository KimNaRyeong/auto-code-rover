        "intended_behavior": "The core issue stems from a naming conflict between a user-defined model field attribute `filterable` and Django's internal use of the `filterable` attribute within the ORM layer to determine if a field or expression can partake in filter operations. To resolve this issue without impacting existing functionality for all Django users, the intended behavior should involve a refactor or update of how Django's ORM determines if an expression is filterable, perhaps by: - Renaming the internal attribute from `filterable` to something less likely to be used by end-users, ensuring backward compatibility by checking if the model field explicitly defines this attribute and handling it accordingly. - Introducing a namespacing or scoping mechanism for internal attribute names to prevent naming conflicts with user-defined model attributes. - Providing a clear error message or warning when Django detects model field attributes that clash with internal attribute names, guiding developers towards resolving the conflict. This method's intended behavior is to maintain its original purpose: ensuring expressions used in filter clauses are suitable for such operations. However, it should do so in a way that recognizes and accommodates the possibility that developers might unknowingly use attribute names that conflict with Django's internal mechanics."
