Search for any method or class that might be directly related to the issue. Since the issue description mentions a specific logic called during excluding a multi-valued relationship, it is likely tied to a particular method. The method mentioned is `sql.Query.split_exclude`, so first, we'll search for this method to understand where it's defined and to get the context of its implementation.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"split_exclude\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue specifically calls out the handling of multi-valued relationships and the optimization of SQL queries, it might be beneficial to look into how these SQL queries are structured in the codebase. However, without knowing the exact classes or files these operations are defined in, it\u2019s hard to target a search. If `split_exclude` provides specific file or class context, we would proceed with more targeted searches based on that information.\n\n3. Assuming the method `split_exclude` is part of a larger query-building framework or class, it's also useful to see if there are related methods or code snippets that handle SQL query construction, particularly focusing on `NOT IN` constructs which might be scattered across the codebase. With the intention of replacing them or seeing their usage context, we might want to search for code snippets containing \"NOT IN\" to identify these patterns:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"NOT IN\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of where the logic for handling multi-valued relationships through SQL queries is implemented and how it might be optimized by transitioning to `NOT EXISTS`. Further actions will depend on the results obtained from these API calls."

It constructs an SQL query where a condition is applied to exclude records based on the defined criteria. The method comments subtly hint at a consideration for potentially using `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead of `WHERE NOT IN` due to easier optimization by the database's query planner and better handling of NULL values.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThis method directly relates to the reported issue. It employs a `NOT IN` SQL pattern to exclude certain records, which is identified as potentially inefficient and problematic in terms of optimization and NULL handling. The code snippet's comments acknowledge this potential inefficiency and suggest `NOT EXISTS` as a preferable approach, aligning with the issue's recommendation.\n\n#### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior of modifying this part of the code would be to refactor the query construction to leverage `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN`. This would presumably improve the efficiency of generated SQL queries by the Django ORM when excluding records based on relations, especially in scenarios with complex JOINS and where NULL values might be present. The goal would be to ensure SQL queries generated by Django's ORM are optimized for performance and correct in their handling of NULLs.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nGiven the direct relation of the `split_exclude` method to the issue and the clear identification of the problematic `NOT IN` logic together with the suggestion to move towards `NOT EXISTS`, the next step would be to:\n\n- Refactor the `split_exclude` method's logic to replace the `NOT IN (SELECT parent_id FROM thetable WHERE name = 'foo' AND parent_id IS NOT NULL)` pattern with a `NOT EXISTS` subquery pattern.\n- Ensure the refactoring properly handles the complexities of NULL values in a way that maintains or improves query performance across different database backends supported by Django.\n- Proceed to testing to ensure that this change does not introduce regressions or affect query correctness while observing any performance improvements.\n\nThis analysis provides a focused direction for addressing the reported issue by refining the query generation to adopt best practices for SQL query performance and correctness."

The intended modification is to refactor this method to use `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN` to improve query performance and handle NULL values more effectively. The logic within `split_exclude` should be adapted to generate a `NOT EXISTS` subquery for the exclusion filter, ensuring that the new approach still supports the same filtering capabilities while making the query more efficient and reliable, especially regarding NULL handling. This changes aims to preserve the existing functionality of excluding records based on a given set of criteria while improving the method's efficiency and correctness."
