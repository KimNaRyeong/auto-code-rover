Currently, it likely processes all keystrokes uniformly, hence the issue with styling compound keystrokes differently.\n   - For compound keystrokes (e.g., `Shift+X`), the parent `<kbd>` element generated by the `KeyboardTransform` class should include an additional CSS class, such as `compound`, to distinguish it from single keystrokes and other child `<kbd>` elements. This way, CSS can target compound keystroke containers specifically, allowing for different styling as required by the issue report.\n   - The existing functionality for single keystrokes must be preserved, ensuring that they continue to be rendered correctly without the additional `compound` class. Thus, the method(s) undertaking the transformation need conditional logic to check if the keystroke is compound and then, and only then, add the `compound` class to the parent `<kbd>` element.\n   - This enhancement requires logic to parse the `:kbd:` content to detect compound keystrokes (identified by the presence of a plus `+` sign or similar delimiters) and apply the modified HTML structure only in those cases."
