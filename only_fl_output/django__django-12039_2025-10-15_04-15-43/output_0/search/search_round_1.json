When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

The issue points directly to the handling of `col_suffixes` in the `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns` class and also mentions how indexes with `opclasses` are affected. Let's focus on gathering information on those areas:\n\n1. To understand how the `Index` class generates the faulty SQL, it's essential to look into the implementation of this class.\n2. Since the `Columns` class was explicitly mentioned along with a link pointing to a problematic line in `ddl_references.py`, examining this file further would be beneficial.\n\nHere are the API calls that can help retrieve the necessary context to address the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the Index class** to see how it's implemented and how it might be generating the CREATE INDEX statements.\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. **Search within `ddl_references.py` for the `Columns` class**, since the issue points to this file as part of the problem.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Columns\", \"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\")`\n\n3. **Get code around the problematic line** to understand how `col_suffixes` are handled, as the issue description suggests there's a problem with how empty strings within `col_suffixes` are leading to the spacing issue.\n   - Given that there's no exact line number provided and the URL to the file might reflect a state of the repository at a specific time, it's essential to look at the logic around the handling of `col_suffixes` rather than a specific line. However, since the direct line isn't provided, this step might require a generic look into the implementation details of how columns are referenced during index creation, so skipping the direct line lookup.\n\n4. Since `opclasses` are mentioned, it's also important to understand how they are processed during the SQL generation for CREATE INDEX statements.\n   - `search_code(\"opclasses\")`\n\nThese API calls should help gather the necessary code context around how Django generates SQL for index creation and how the spacing issue tied to descending order and `opclasses` usage without explicit ordering comes about."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context surrounding the issue with whitespace in `CREATE INDEX` statements in Django's implementation, let's dissect the findings from the results of the made API calls:\n\n### 1. Index Class in `django/db/models/indexes.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `Index` class defines how database indexes should be constructed in Django models. It includes properties such as `fields`, `name`, `db_tablespace`, and `opclasses`, alongside methods for constructing SQL statements (`create_sql`, `remove_sql`), and other utility functions like `deconstruct`, `clone`, and `set_name_with_model`. \n\n**Relationship with the bug**\nThe `create_sql` method within this class is likely where the SQL for creating indexes is generated. Given the bug description involves incorrect formatting in the generated SQL statements, this method and how it handles `col_suffixes` and `opclasses` could be central to where the bug originates.\n\n**Intended behavior**\nThe intended behavior would be for the `create_sql` method to correctly format SQL statements with proper spacing, both when `opclasses` are specified and when columns have a descending order (`-name`).\n\n### 2. Columns Class in `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `Columns` class holds references to one or many columns with functionality to return a string representation of these columns, correctly appending any `col_suffixes` where necessary. This includes handling both the quoting of column names and appending any suffixes provided.\n\n**Relationship with the bug**\nGiven the issue indicates that the space (or the lack thereof) after column names or `opclasses` in generated SQL statements is problematic, the implementation of string representation in `Columns`, specifically around `col_suffixes`, is directly related. The logic that appends `col_suffixes` to column names (or leaves space where expected) would be a likely place for the bug.\n\n**Intended behavior**\nThe intended behavior for this class would be to ensure that any `col_suffixes` or elements related to `opclasses` are appended correctly to column names, including correct spacing. This means handling empty strings in `col_suffixes` in such a way that they do not lead to incorrectly formatted SQL statements.\n\n### 3. `opclasses` Usage Across the Codebase\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\nOccurrences of `opclasses` across files like `ddl_references.py`, `base/schema.py`, and `postgresql/schema.py` suggest that `opclasses` play a vital role in specifying how a column should be indexed, especially for database backends that support this feature (like PostgreSQL).\n\n**Relationship with the bug**\nThe bug description specifically mentions the use of `opclasses` leading to spacing issues in the generated SQL. This means that the implementation of index creation where `opclasses` are handled is not correctly managing spaces or suffixes, affecting the visual and syntactical correctness of SQL. \n\n**Intended behavior**\nThe handling of `opclasses` in index creation should ensure that the generated SQL respects proper formatting rules, including the presence or absence of spaces as needed, with or without `opclasses` being specified.\n\nGiven this analysis, a deeper look into how `create_sql` in `Index` and the string representation in `Columns` handle `col_suffixes` and `opclasses`, respectively, could illuminate the source of the bug and suggest where changes need to be made to achieve the intended behavior described."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This involves handling descending order indicators (e.g., `-name`) and the presence of `opclasses` correctly. Specifically, when generating the part of the SQL statement that specifies columns and their order (`ASC`, `DESC`), it should ensure that a space is consistently included between column names, order direction, and any `opclasses`. This preserves the functionality of creating indexes while ensuring the SQL is formatted correctly.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`\n  - **Class:** `Columns`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `Columns` class's string representation method (or a method handling string generation for `CREATE INDEX` SQL specifically) needs to account for and correctly handle empty strings in `col_suffixes`. When generating the final SQL fragment for column references in indexes, it should ensure no unwanted spaces are included when `col_suffixes` are empty, and that necessary spaces are present when joining column names with `opclasses`. This adjustment will address the spacing issue observed in the SQL output, ensuring that `opclasses` are correctly formatted with or without a column order specifier.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors are critical for resolving the issue described, ensuring that the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statements generated by Django are both syntactically correct and adhere to expected formatting standards."
