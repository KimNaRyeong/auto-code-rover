This involves handling descending order indicators (e.g., `-name`) and the presence of `opclasses` correctly. Specifically, when generating the part of the SQL statement that specifies columns and their order (`ASC`, `DESC`), it should ensure that a space is consistently included between column names, order direction, and any `opclasses`. This preserves the functionality of creating indexes while ensuring the SQL is formatted correctly."

        "intended_behavior": "The `Columns` class's string representation method (or a method handling string generation for `CREATE INDEX` SQL specifically) needs to account for and correctly handle empty strings in `col_suffixes`. When generating the final SQL fragment for column references in indexes, it should ensure no unwanted spaces are included when `col_suffixes` are empty, and that necessary spaces are present when joining column names with `opclasses`. This adjustment will address the spacing issue observed in the SQL output, ensuring that `opclasses` are correctly formatted with or without a column order specifier."
