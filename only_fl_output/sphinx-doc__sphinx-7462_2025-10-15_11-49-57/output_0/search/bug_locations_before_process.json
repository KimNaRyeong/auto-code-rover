        "intended_behavior": "The `unparse` method needs to be modified to handle empty tuples correctly. This involves adding a check before the `pop` operation to ensure the `result` list is not empty. This way, when the method encounters an empty tuple annotation, it will not attempt to pop the last comma, thus preventing the `IndexError` from being raised. The intended behavior should preserve the normal processing of non-empty tuples and other AST nodes, only altering the behavior for the edge case of empty tuples."
