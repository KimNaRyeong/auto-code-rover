Search for the `pretty.py` file to identify if it hosts related functions or classes for pretty printing, as the issue description suggests that the fix was intended for this file.\n   \n2. Search for any existing methods or classes related to pretty printing in the `SymPy` library, specifically targeting the `lerchphi` function, to understand the current implementation before adding new functionality. The `PrettyPrinter` class or similar may be involved.\n\n3. Search for any existing code that mentions `lerchphi` to see how it's currently being handled or if there are any specific cases already in place for pretty printing or standard functionality.\n\nBased on the issue description, here are the API calls:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"class PrettyPrinter\", \"pretty.py\")`: To find the `PrettyPrinter` class or equivalent in `pretty.py` where modifications are likely needed.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"lerchphi\", \"pretty.py\")`: To check if there are already specific pretty-print methods for `lerchphi` in `pretty.py`.\n- `search_code(\"lerchphi\")`: To get a broader context of how `lerchphi` is used or defined in the project.\n\nThese searches should provide a solid understanding of where and how to implement the requested pretty-print functionality for `lerchphi`."
