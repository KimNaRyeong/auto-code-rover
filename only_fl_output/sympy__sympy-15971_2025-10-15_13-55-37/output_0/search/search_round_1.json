        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can derive the following insights and steps forward:\n\n1. **PrettyPrinter Class in `pretty.py`**:\n   - The `PrettyPrinter` class inherits from `Printer` and is designed to convert expressions into a 2D ASCII-art representation. This class is crucial for implementing pretty printing functionalities in SymPy.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: Since the issue involves adding pretty-printing functionality for the `lerchphi` function, modifications are likely to be needed in this class to include a new method or modify an existing one to handle `lerchphi` expressions specifically.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The goal would be to implement a method within `PrettyPrinter` or a related mechanism that recognizes `lerchphi` function calls and properly formats them into a visually appealing, human-readable form.\n\n2. **Non-existence of `lerchphi` Methods in `pretty.py`**:\n   - The search indicates that there is currently no implementation for pretty printing the `lerchphi` function in `pretty.py`. This is the gap that needs to be filled to resolve the issue.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: This confirms the necessity of the issue being addressed, showing there is no existing implementation for pretty printing the `lerchphi` function, hence the need for development.\n   - **Intended behavior**: We need to create a new method or logic within the `PrettyPrinter` class or its workflow to detect and format `lerchphi` when encountered.\n\n3. **Occurrences of `lerchphi` in the Codebase**:\n   - `lerchphi` is referenced in multiple files, notably in `hyperexpand.py`, the `__init__.py` of `functions`, `zeta_functions.py`, and in LaTeX printing support (`latex.py`).\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: These files likely contain the definitions and manipulations of the `lerchphi` function. This is crucial for understanding how `lerchphi` is currently being handled in terms of logic, representation, and LaTeX printing. The way `lerchphi` is represented in LaTeX could provide insights into how it should be represented in ASCII pretty print.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The references, particularly in `zeta_functions.py`, could guide the development of pretty-printing functionality by understanding the mathematical representation and usage of `lerchphi`. The representation in `latex.py` could serve as inspiration for how to structure its pretty print format.\n\nGiven the above context and analysis, the next steps would involve:\n- Exploring how `lerchphi` is implemented and used within `zeta_functions.py` and `hyperexpand.py` could provide insights into how it works and any special considerations needed for pretty printing.\n- Looking at how `lerchphi` is formatted for LaTeX in `latex.py` might offer ideas on how to approach its pretty-print representation.\n- With this information, development can proceed on implementing a method or updating an existing workflow in `PrettyPrinter` to handle `lerchphi` pretty printing, ensuring consistency with its mathematical representation and existing printing formats.\n\nThe immediate next API call would likely involve diving deeper into how `lerchphi` is represented in existing code, particularly:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"lerchphi\", \"sympy/functions/special/zeta_functions.py\")`: This would help understand the implementation and representation logic of `lerchphi`.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"lerchphi\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")`: To see how `lerchphi` is currently formatted for LaTeX output, which could guide the ASCII pretty print formatting."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This method should check for instances of the `lerchphi` function within the expressions being pretty-printed and format them into a readable, aesthetically pleasing ASCII art form. The method should capture and accurately represent the mathematical functionality of `lerchphi`, incorporating appropriate formatting rules to ensure that the pretty-printed output is both interpretable and consistent with SymPy's pretty printing standards for special functions. This task involves identifying the parameters of `lerchphi` and deciding on their representation in the output. The mechanism for identifying `lerchphi` functions within expressions and formatting them needs to be integrated seamlessly with the existing pretty printing processes, ensuring that it does not interfere with the rendering of other expressions or symbols that may be part of the input."
