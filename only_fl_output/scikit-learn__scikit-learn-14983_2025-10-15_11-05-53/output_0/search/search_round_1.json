        "content": "The supplied information reveals that both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes are defined in the file `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` and inherit from a base class named `_RepeatedSplits`. Neither class has a custom `__repr__` method defined, which is likely why the issue with the incorrect `__repr__` string is occurring. By default, if a Python object does not have a `__repr__` method defined, it inherits one from its nearest ancestor in the class hierarchy that does. If none of the ancestors up to `object` defines `__repr__`, then the default implementation is used, which merely shows the object's class name and memory address, not a user-friendly representation that includes instance-specific attribute values.\n\nGiven this context, to address the issue, we need to:\n\n1. **Understand the intended representation**: According to the expected results mentioned in the issue, the correct `__repr__` for these classes should include the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` attributes.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**: The bug arises because a specific `__repr__` method that outputs the desired string format is missing from both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior would be to implement a `__repr__` method that dynamically constructs a string including the class name and the current values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. This method needs to be added to both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n\nGiven the inheritance from `_RepeatedSplits`, it\u2019s also valuable to check if `_RepeatedSplits` has a `__repr__` method that could potentially be overridden or if it is absent, which necessitates implementing `__repr__` from scratch for both classes. If `_RepeatedSplits` does have such a method, understanding its implementation would be crucial to ensure consistency and possibly extend it in `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n\nBased on these considerations, the next steps involve:\n\n- Checking the `_RepeatedSplits` class for any existing `__repr__` method or relevant implementation that helps with the issue.\n- Depending on the findings, decide whether to override an existing method or implement a new one in both child classes.\n\nTherefore, the next API call would be to investigate the `_RepeatedSplits` class for a `__repr__` method.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"_RepeatedSplits\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"_RepeatedSplits\")\n```"
