Given the issue encountered when running the script previously provided, it's crucial to adjust the script to specifically target the reported problem while ensuring any needed dependencies are checked for or correctly installed. However, assuming that the environment for running this script has scikit-learn installed correctly, the nature of the failure indicates an environmental problem rather than a problem with the test script itself.

For environments where scikit-learn is not installed correctly or fully built, these types of import errors can occur, preventing the script from running as intended. It's also important to make sure that the version of scikit-learn is compatible with the script's expected functionality. The issue described originally pertains to the `__repr__` methods of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, not to the environment setup, so let's focus on ensuring the script is directly addressing this.

Let me provide an updated script that does not change fundamentally—since the original script was correct for its purpose—but please ensure your environment where scikit-learn is installed is correctly set up. This means:
- Having a compatible version of scikit-learn installed (the issue mentions version 0.21.2).
- Ensuring that scikit-learn is fully built if installed from source, as mentioned in the error message.

Here's the original script with the correct purpose and function to detect the reported issue regarding `__repr__`. Before running, verify your scikit-learn installation by running something like `python -m pip show scikit-learn` to confirm the version and installation status.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_correct_repr():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    expected_rkf = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

    rkf_repr = repr(RepeatedKFold())
    rskf_repr = repr(RepeatedStratifiedKFold())

    assert rkf_repr == expected_rkf, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedKFold: {rkf_repr}"
    assert rskf_repr == expected_rskf, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedStratifiedKFold: {rskf_repr}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_correct_repr()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    print("No issue found.")
    exit(0)
```

Ensure your environment is correctly set up to run this script, addressing any installation or build issues with scikit-learn beforehand.
