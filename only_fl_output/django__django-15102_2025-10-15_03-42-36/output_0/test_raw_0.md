### Explanation:
- This script aims to reproduce a Django issue where running `startproject` does not respect the userâ€™s `umask` settings.
- We start by saving the current `umask` and then setting it to `077` to only allow the owner read and write permissions.
- We attempt to create a new Django project which should trigger the creation of various files including `settings.py`.
- If the `settings.py` file does not respect the `umask` settings (i.e., it has permissions different from `-rw-------` which is expected from `umask 077`), an `AssertionError` is raised.
- If the required file `settings.py` is found and its permission matches the expectation set by `umask`, the script acknowledges that the issue is fixed.
- Throughout the process, `try...except` blocks are used to handle potential exceptions, ensuring that the original `umask` is restored regardless of the execution outcome.
- If any exceptions occur, the `print_stacktrace` function is called to provide detailed debug information, and the script exits with code `1` denoting failure to comply with expected behavior.
- If the script execution completes without encountering issues that breach the `umask` settings condition, it exits with code `0`, indicating success.
