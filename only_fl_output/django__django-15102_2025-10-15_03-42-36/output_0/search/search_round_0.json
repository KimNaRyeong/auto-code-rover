This means that the user's umask doesn't work, e.g.:\n$ umask 077\n$ touch foo\n$ ls -l foo\n-rw------- 1 talex talex 0 2007-05-12 13:27 foo\n$ PYTHONPATH=trunk ./trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py startproject mysite\n$ ls -l mysite/settings.py\n-rw-r--r-- 1 talex talex 2804 2007-05-12 13:28 mysite/settings.py\nI discovered this whilst trying to make a Zero Install package for Django. Everything in the Zero Install cache is read-only, so startproject fails with:\nFile \"/var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=262c95b5a7cc34f525408b675106e4e4ae3494cc/django/core/management.py\", line 799, in startproject\nfp = open(main_settings_file, 'w')\nIOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../site/settings.py'\nThanks,\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how Django's `startproject` command works, especially how it handles file permissions when creating project files like `settings.py`. The user's umask is not being honored, which leads to incorrect permission settings for new files. Here are the API calls that we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the method that's responsible for handling the creation of new files in the `startproject` command. We'll start by looking for the `startproject` command itself.\n   - `search_method(\"startproject\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue also explicitly mentions the handling of file permissions not respecting the user's `umask`, we should look for code snippets that involve permission settings or file writing operations within the context of `startproject`.\n   - `search_code(\"open\")`\n   - `search_code(\"chmod\")`\n\n3. The error traceback provided mentions a failure related to writing to `settings.py` due to permission issues. Thus, it's helpful to search for where `settings.py` might be specifically handled in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"settings.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to locate the critical sections of the Django codebase where modifications may need to be made to respect the user's `umask` when the `startproject` command creates new files."
