        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location needs to be modified to change the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable's value to incorporate the module name (`%(name)s`) as part of the logging format. The proposed format suggested in the issue is \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\". This change aims to enhance the logging output by including both the log level and the module name alongside the filename and line number, improving the ability of developers to trace the source of log messages. The existing functionality, which includes the filename, line number, log level, and message, should be preserved while extending the format to include the module name appropriately. This adjustment also implies that wherever `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is utilized within the codebase (e.g., for configuring loggers), it would automatically start displaying logs in the new, more informative format without requiring additional adjustments specifically for the format to take effect."
