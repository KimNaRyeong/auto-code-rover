The format specifies that log messages should include the filename (padded to 25 characters), the line number (padded to 4 digits), the log level (padded to 8 characters), followed by the actual log message.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue indicates that the current logging format lacks the module name which could be crucial for debugging or tracing log messages back to their origin more effectively. The issue description suggests replacing the filename with the module name and possibly including the filename and relative path later in the format. Thus, the line of code directly relates to the change requested in the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to adjust the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable to include the module name (`%(name)s`) and potentially to format the output to include both the module name and the relative file path. A proposed format is \"`%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s`\".\n\nGiven the specific change request in the issue description, the next steps would involve adjusting the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in `src/_pytest/logging.py`. However, before proceeding with a patch, it might be beneficial to:\n\n- Review any comments or documentation in `src/_pytest/logging.py` around the existing `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` definition to understand the rationale for the current format.\n- Search for places where `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used or referenced to understand how changes might impact other parts of the codebase.\n\nBased on the singleton nature of the found definition, additional context could be gathered by examining the code around the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` definition within `src/_pytest/logging.py` to understand how it is used and if there are mechanisms to overwrite or customize this default in different contexts (e.g., user configuration).\n\nLet's proceed with the latter, aiming to understand the immediate context wherein this variable is applied:\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/logging.py\", 18, 10)\n```\n\nThis call aims to examine the broader usage of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`, checking for potential comments or adjacent configuration options that may provide additional insights or considerations for implementing the suggested improvements."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The proposed format suggested in the issue is `\"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"`. This change aims to enhance the logging output by including both the log level and the module name alongside the filename and line number, improving the ability of developers to trace the source of log messages. The existing functionality, which includes the filename, line number, log level, and message, should be preserved while extending the format to include the module name appropriately. This adjustment also implies that wherever `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is utilized within the codebase (e.g., for configuring loggers), it would automatically start displaying logs in the new, more informative format without requiring additional adjustments specifically for the format to take effect."
