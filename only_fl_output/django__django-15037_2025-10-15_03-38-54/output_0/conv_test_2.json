You may need to adjust the `DATABASES` setting for a more accurate reproduction against such databases.\n- The Django environment is set up programmatically within the script through `settings.configure()` and `django.setup()`.\n- The script attempts to simulate table creation and a foreign key reference similar to the described issue with raw SQL commands and then uses Django's `inspectdb` command to introspect the database schema.\n- If the assertion fails, it means the script detected the issue as described. On success, it indicates the specific foreign key reference handling might no longer be an issue, or the reproduction scenario needs adjustment for the specific database backend in use.\n- The adjusted `print_stacktrace` function helps in debugging by printing a clear traceback if exceptions occur."
