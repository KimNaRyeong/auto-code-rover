        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `latex` method and the `print_latex` function within the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file:\n\n### Analysis of the `latex` Method\n\n1. **Functionality**: This method converts the given expression to a LaTeX string representation. It has a wide range of parameters to configure how expressions are converted, including how fractions, inverse trigonometric functions, and matrices are displayed, along with several other formatting options.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: The issue described involves the incorrect LaTeX wrapping of expressions when converting Jupyter notebook outputs to LaTeX or PDF formats. The `latex` method includes an `itex` option, which specifies if itex-specific syntax is used, including emitting `$$...$$`. Since the issue describes an incorrect LaTeX wrapping related to the `$$\\begin{equation*}...$$` syntax, this method seems to be directly relevant to the issue, particularly the handling of the `mode` parameter that can be set to `inline`, `equation`, or `equation*`. \n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the bug's nature, adjusting the `latex` method to correctly handle LaTeX wrapping without unnecessary `$$` delimiters for `equation` or `equation*` modes could be a solution. This would involve ensuring that when expressions are meant to be displayed as stand-alone equations (thus requiring the `equation*` environment for non-numbered equations in LaTeX), they are not doubly wrapped with `$$...$$`, which switches them back to math mode, creating a conflict.\n\n### Analysis of the `print_latex` Function\n\n1. **Functionality**: This function simply prints the LaTeX representation of a given expression. It funnels through the `latex` method by passing any specified settings directly to it.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: While `print_latex` itself is likely not directly responsible for the issue, it is relevant in the context of understanding how LaTeX expressions are rendered and printed in the broader sympy ecosystem. Given that this function uses the same settings as `latex()`, any changes to how `latex()` handles its parameters\u2014specifically regarding LaTeX wrapping\u2014would impact how `print_latex` outputs LaTeX representations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The expected behavior from a fix would not necessarily involve changes to `print_latex` directly, but ensuring that the underlying `latex` method behaves correctly with respect to LaTeX wrapping would, by extension, ensure that expressions printed using `print_latex` are correctly formatted.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the relationship between the reported issue and the codebase's current handling of LaTeX expressions, particularly the use of `$$` delimiters within certain modes, a focused analysis and adjustment of how the `latex` method applies these delimiters based on the `mode` parameter seem warranted.\n\nUnderstanding that the `latex` method can work in different modes (`plain`, `inline`, `equation`, `equation*`), and considering it already has an `itex` boolean flag to toggle between different types of delimiters, the solution might involve:\n\n- Reviewing or adjusting the logic related to these parameters to ensure they correctly handle all scenarios, particularly the use of `equation` or `equation*` within the context of the `itex` flag or similar settings.\n- Ensuring that when in `equation*` mode, expressions are not unnecessarily wrapped in `$$`, which causes the LaTeX processor to treat them incorrectly.\n\nThese insights point towards the need for modifications within the handling of these specific settings in the `latex` method to resolve the described issue."

The `mode` parameter's handling needs to ensure that when expressions are set to be displayed in these modes, they are treated as being in LaTeX math mode by default and thus do not require the additional `$$` wrapping. This adjustment should preserve the method's current functionality while fixing the LaTeX output issue when converting Jupyter notebooks to LaTeX or PDF formats. Specifically, the check surrounding the usage of `$$` (related to the `itex` flag or when setting the `mode`) should be refined to exclude cases where the expression is already meant to be in a math environment (`equation` or `equation*` modes). This ensures that the output LaTeX is valid and can be processed without errors by LaTeX compilers.\n\n**Additional Context:** The detailed analysis suggests that the main issue lies in how the `latex` function handles math mode delimiters (`$$`) around `equation` or `equation*` environments. The solution should be focused on refining this logic to align with LaTeX best practices, ensuring compatibility with LaTeX processors and preventing the documented error from occurring."
