LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.\nSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.\nType  H <return>  for immediate help.\n...\nl.300     $$\\begin{equation*}\n1\\end{equation*}$$\n?\n!

        "content": "To effectively address this issue, we need to understand where and how the LaTeX conversion is handled in the Jupyter notebook or nbconvert project. Based on the description of the issue, it seems necessary to find the part of the code that wraps outputs in LaTeX with `$$...$$` and modify it to use `$\\displaystyle ...$` instead. The functions or methods that handle LaTeX output formatting, particularly for displaying equations or mathematical expressions, are of interest.\n\nLet's start by collecting some code context with the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for a code snippet to find where the LaTeX wrapping with `$$` occurs**: This is critical for identifying the exact location in the codebase where the output is being wrapped incorrectly. We need to replace `$$\\begin{equation*}...$$` with a different format.\n   - `search_code(\"$$\\\\begin{equation*}\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods related to LaTeX conversion or output formatting**: Since the issue describes a problem with LaTeX output, methods that likely manipulate or generate LaTeX code for output are relevant. Given the commonality of printing tasks in sympy and nbconvert, looking for anything related to 'printing' or 'LaTeX' would be useful.\n   - `search_method(\"latex\")`\n   - `search_method(\"print_latex\")`\n\nThe collected context from these API calls will help identify the code sections that need modification to resolve the LaTeX output issue described."
