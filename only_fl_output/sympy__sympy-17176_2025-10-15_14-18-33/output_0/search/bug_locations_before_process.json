        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `_finger` should produce distinct fingerprints for logically different expressions, even when they involve complex operations like `Xor` and negation. Since the current implementation erroneously assigns identical fingerprints to distinct expressions (`(A1 & A2 & A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & A2 & ~A3)` and `(A1 & A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (~A1 & A2 & A3)`), the algorithm needs a refinement that better captures the distinct logical structures of expressions involving `Xor`. This might involve more nuanced tracking of the context in which symbols appear, particularly for complex boolean operations."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary issue lies within `_finger` impacting `bool_map`, it's possible `bool_map` might also require adjustments after changes to `_finger`. Ensuring `bool_map` accurately reflects the equivalence or lack thereof between two boolean expressions, once `_finger` is corrected, is essential. If `_finger`'s improvements change the data structure or interpretation of fingerprints, `bool_map` may need corresponding adjustments to utilize this data effectively. The intended behavior here remains to accurately identify when two boolean expressions are logically equivalent through variable mapping while preserving its capability to handle simpler cases as currently intended. This ensures that cases like `Xor` being equivalent to its negation are correctly handled, reflecting that such mappings should not exist as they represent different logical behaviors."
