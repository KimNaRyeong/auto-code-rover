To accurately reproduce the issue you've described related to Django's command line option parsing within a mutually exclusive group when using list arguments, we'll craft a standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script intends to replicate the problem and will attempt the suggested operations that lead to the failure. For clarity and tracking, a deliberate AssertionError is introduced to reflect when the issue is present, adhering to the specific conditions you requested.

Execute the following steps to create the script:

1. **Create `reproducer.py`:** Use the provided code template.
2. **Install Django:** If not already available in your environment (since the script depends on Django).
3. **Run the script:** Use `python3 reproducer.py` within your project's root directory.

Here's your revised `reproducer.py` script:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
        from django.core.management import call_command
        from django.conf import settings
        import django

        settings.configure()
        django.setup()

        class Command(BaseCommand):
            def add_arguments(self, parser):
                group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
                group.add_argument('--foo', nargs='+', type=int)

            def handle(self, *args, **options):
                pass

        # Mocking Django's command line call
        try:
            call_command('some_command', foo=[1, 2, 3])
        except CommandError as ce:
            print_stacktrace(ce)
            raise AssertionError from ce

        # The following line will only be reached if no assertion is raised, indicating a fix
        print("Executed without raising CommandError. The issue might be fixed.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**
- This script sets up a minimal Django environment to avoid the missing command issue reported in the previous execution.
- It includes a mock Django command within the `main()` function rather than relying on Django to discover it unsuccessfully due to execution context differences.
- This approach aims to simulate the environment where the issue happens closely, focusing on the command line argument handling.
- If the script succeeds in calling `call_command` without issues related to argument parsing or mutual exclusivity, it means the issue might not be reproducible under these simulated conditions.

**Next Steps:**
Should the script fail as designed—signifying the presence of the described issue—the stack trace printed will help identify the failure point within Django's management command infrastructure or the custom command logic itself. Conversely, a successful execution without assertion errors may suggest either an environmental factor affecting the previous setup or adjustments in newer Django versions that mitigate this issue.
