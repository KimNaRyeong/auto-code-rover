        "content": "The collected context provides valuable information about the `MCodePrinter` class from the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file. This class is designed to convert SymPy expressions into their Mathematica equivalent. The issue described is specifically concerned with two aspects:\n\n1. **Handling of Derivatives**: The current implementation lacks a method (`_print_Derivative`) for handling derivatives correctly. Given the issue description, the intended behavior for this part of the code would be to properly translate a SymPy derivative expression into the corresponding Mathematica `D` function syntax. For example, converting `Derivative(f(t), t)` into `D[f[t], t]`. Since the search for `_print_Derivative` yielded no results, it clarifies that this functionality is currently missing and needs to be implemented for proper handling of derivative expressions.\n\n2. **Handling of Floats With Exponents**: Similarly, the absence of a `_print_Float` method means the class currently does not specifically handle floating-point numbers, especially in the format with exponents (e.g., `1.0e-4`). The reported issue and the intended fix suggest that floating numbers should be correctly formatted into Mathematica's notation for exponents (`1.0*^-4`). Since this method is also not found, it highlights a gap in the current implementation regarding how floats with exponents are printed.\n\nGiven this context, the relationship between these parts of the code and the bug is straightforward: the missing methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` lead to the incorrect or default handling of derivatives and floats with exponents in the Mathematica code printer functionality. Introducing these methods as described in the issue would directly address the reported problems, aligning the output closer to Mathematica's expected syntax.\n\nTo complete the context necessary for crafting a patch, we need to ensure where exactly to insert these new methods within the `MCodePrinter` class structure. While the methods do not currently exist, it would be useful to see how similar methods are implemented and structured within the class to ensure consistency and adherence to the existing design pattern. Therefore, considering the structure and existing methods of the `MCodePrinter` class, no further immediate API calls are required. The next step is to craft a patch adding these two methods (`_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float`) according to the code patterns and standards observed in the class definition provided."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Specifically, for an expression like `Derivative(f(t), t)`, the method should return a string `D[f[t], t]`, which correctly represents the derivative in Mathematica syntax.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n   - **File**: sympy/printing/mathematica.py\n   - **Class**: MCodePrinter\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Create a new method `_print_Float` that handles floating-point numbers with exponents in a way that matches Mathematica's syntax. For instance, a Python float represented as `1.0e-4` should be converted into Mathematica's notation `1.0*^-4`. This method should correctly identify and transform the exponent part from `e` to `*^`, ensuring that the floating-point numbers are accurately represented in Mathematica format."
