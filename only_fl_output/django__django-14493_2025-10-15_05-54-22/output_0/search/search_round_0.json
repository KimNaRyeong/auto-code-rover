        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we should perform the following API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` is implemented and particularly how it uses `max_post_process_passes`, we should look into its class definition:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")\n```\n\n2. The issue points out a problem in the `post_process` method related to how `substitutions` is handled, specifically in the block of code referenced by the GitHub URL. We should examine the `post_process` method of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")\n```\n\n3. To get the exact context of where the `UnboundLocalError` occurs, we should look at the code around the problematic area mentioned in the issue description:\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", 251, 5)\n```\n\nThese calls should provide sufficient context for the issue at hand, laying the groundwork for crafting a patch that resolves the `UnboundLocalError` by ensuring `substitutions` is handled correctly even when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0."
