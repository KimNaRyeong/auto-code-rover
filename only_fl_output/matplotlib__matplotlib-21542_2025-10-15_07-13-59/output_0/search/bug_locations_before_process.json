        "intended_behavior": "Currently, this method initializes self.formatter with an old-style FormatStrFormatter if a format string is provided, leading to the reported inconsistency. The intended behavior is to allow this initialization to either default to new-style string formatting or remove this specific logic, letting the formatting be handled more generically downstream (potentially via the Axis class's _set_formatter method). This adjustment would ensure consistency with the formatting conventions of normal axes. Additionally, to address backward compatibility and guide users through the transition, a deprecation warning for old-style format strings in this context might be needed. The implementation should be carefully designed to preserve existing functionality (e.g., when a Formatter instance is passed directly) while integrating the new behavior."

        "intended_behavior": "Since this method directly sets the formatter onto the colorbar's long axis, it's crucial that the formatter passed respects the new-style formatting conventions. Depending on the changes made to the __init__ method or formatter handling logic elsewhere, ensuring that update_ticks supports and reinforces the use of new-style string formatting (or any new formatting logic) without imposing legacy constraints is necessary. This does not necessarily imply that update_ticks itself is 'buggy,' but rather, it may need to be updated or augmented to align with and support the proposed enhancement."
