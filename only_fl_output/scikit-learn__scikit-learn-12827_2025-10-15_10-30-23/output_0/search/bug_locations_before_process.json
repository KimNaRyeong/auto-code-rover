        "intended_behavior": "The documentation within the `QuantileTransformer` class should be updated to include a detailed explanation of its implementation, especially how it maps data to a uniform or normal distribution. This explanation should cover if and how the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) is computed or approximated, and then how this empirical CDF or its equivalent is used to transform the input data to match the desired output distribution. The intention is not to alter the functionality but to make the existing implementation clearer to users and developers by providing insight into the underlying algorithmic approach, possibly referencing computational methods, mathematical formulas involved in the transformation process, and how the parameters of the class affect this process."
