Request aborted.\nReason given for failure: CSRF token missing or incorrect.\nExpected behaviour:\nFilesystem error or similar reporting incorrect media storage setup.\nComment:\nYes, the setup in this scenario is invalid to begin with, but the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem.\nI suspect a real problem with an underlying filesystem will also get covered in the same way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue about CSRF failure incorrectly reported due to storage problems during file uploads in a Django project, the following search API calls can be made based on the information provided in the issue description:\n\n1. To understand how the `File` model is set up and interacts with file uploads:\n   - `search_class(\"File\")`\n\n2. To get insights into how Django admin is configured for the File model, which might include custom admin methods related to file handling:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"FileAdmin\", \"app/admin.py\")`\n\n3. Given that the problem could lie in how file uploads are handled, especially concerning temporary storage and filesystem checks, it would be valuable to see how Django's file upload mechanism is implemented or overridden in the project:\n   - `search_method(\"save\")` searching globally for the `save` method as it's commonly used in Django models and storage classes, but without specific class context, it catches any override or usage related to file handling.\n   - `search_method(\"handle_uploaded_file\")` because the handling of uploaded files directly might have custom implementations that are essential to the issue.\n\n4. Since the CSRF error could also be related to how storage errors are caught and managed, a search for how exceptions are handled during the upload process could give clues:\n   - `search_code(\"except\")` this is a broad search intending to catch exception handling related to file uploads or storage problems within the project.\n\nPlease proceed with these API calls to provide the necessary code context for addressing the issue described."
