Request aborted.\nReason given for failure: CSRF token missing or incorrect.\nExpected behaviour:\nFilesystem error or similar reporting incorrect media storage setup. \nComment:\nYes, the setup in this scenario is invalid to begin with, but the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem. \nI suspect a real problem with an underlying filesystem will also get covered in the same way.\n"
