        "content": "To address the issue described, it's crucial to understand where and how this particular division operation occurs within the codebase. Since the issue mentions a division operation that leads to `ZeroDivisionError` when using a specific syntax, it's likely connected to a method that handles division operations or a section of code specifically crafted to manage such operations. Therefore, I will initiate the investigation by searching for instances of division operations, especially ones that might interact with fractions or decimal numbers.\n\n1. `search_code(\"2//.5\")` - This will help identify any direct usage of this operation which may be causing the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"divide\")` - Assuming that a method named `divide` or similar could be present, this search will help locate any custom division logic that might be responsible for the error.\n3. `search_code(\"//\")` - This broad search is aimed at finding all instances of the floor division operator to locate potential custom implementations or overrides that could lead to the described behavior.\n\nThese searches are designed to collectively provide a comprehensive overview of how division operations are handled within the project, which is essential for identifying the root cause of the `ZeroDivisionError`."
