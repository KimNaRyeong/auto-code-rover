        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that when performing floor division between numbers, especially involving a Float as the divisor, the operation correctly returns the floored division result. The method should handle floating-point division such that 2//0.5 evaluates to 4, adhering to Python's division rules. This behavior should be consistent regardless of the number types involved in the operation (e.g., Integer, Rational, Float), ensuring that the return value is correctly floored and no ZeroDivisionError is raised unless the divisor is genuinely zero. Any optimizations or special handling for Sympy's specific numeric types should preserve the mathematical integrity of the floor division operation."

        "method": "__rfloordiv__",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to __floordiv__, this method handles the reverse floor division operation. It must ensure that division by floating-point numbers is handled correctly, especially in cases that could lead to improper rounding or errors. The method should ensure that for any Float divisor, the division is handled following mathematical principles, ensuring that operations like 2//0.5 return the correct result, 4. Special attention should be given to maintaining the functionality across different numeric types in Sympy, ensuring that the results are consistent with expected mathematical outcomes and Python's built-in types."
