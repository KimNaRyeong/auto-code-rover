It offers customization options such as line wrapping, number of columns, usage of Unicode characters, precision, ordering, and using a compact square root symbol.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug**: Given the issue mentions the expected behavior of getting \"x_{1,i}\" as a pretty-printed output but ends up with a different representation, it suggests that the issue may reside in how `pretty_print` (or a function it calls, like `pretty`) handles indexed expressions or expressions involving subscripts in general.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior should be that when `pretty_print` is called with an indexed expression, it should format it in a way that matches mathematical conventions closely, which in this context means transforming an expression like `indexed(x1, i)` into a visually appropriate format, likely using subscripts, \"x_{1,i}\".\n\nGiven the absence of findings for a `format_expression` method and the expected output \"x_{1,i}\", there are a couple of strategic API calls we could make next to drill down further:\n\n- Since the `pretty_print` method relies on `pretty` to do the actual formatting as suggested by the snippet, we should explore the `pretty` method itself. There may be specific handling for indexed types that can be adjusted or extended.\n- Given the significant role of the file `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` which likely deals with indexed objects (9 matches found), we should explore how these indexed expressions are formulated and if there's custom pretty-print handling within:\n\n1. **Explore `pretty` Method**: \n- `search_method_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")`: To see the implementation details of `pretty` which is directly called by `pretty_print`.\n\n2. **Investigate Handling of Indexed Expressions**:\n- Since `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` seems crucial for managing indexed expressions, determining how it integrates with the pretty-printing mechanism could be key.\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Indexed\", \"sympy/tensor/indexed.py\")`: To see if there's specific logic within the `Indexed` class that might affect how these objects are pretty-printed, possibly overriding default behavior or providing hooks for customization."

This might involve modifying how indexed objects are detected and rendered, possibly with special cases or enhancements for subscripts and supercripts handling within the pretty printing process.\n\n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`\n     - **Class**: `Indexed`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: If the `Indexed` class contains logic directly impacting how indexed expressions are represented when pretty-printed, it may need to be adjusted to ensure compatibility with the desired pretty-print format. This would involve ensuring that the class provides sufficient metadata or formatting hints to the pretty-printing process to correctly render \"x_{1,i}\" as expected. If `Indexed` class contributions to the pretty-print process are implicit or excessively generic, adding explicit handling or customization options for pretty printing might be necessary.\n\nBoth locations highlight the need for modifications to ensure the pretty printing process respects the formatting conventions for indexed expressions, preserving the overall functionality but enhancing it to address the use case outlined in the issue."
