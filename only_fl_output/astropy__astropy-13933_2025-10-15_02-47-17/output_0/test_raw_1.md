Given the feedback on the previous submission, it looks like there was an error in testing due to a missing module rather than the script not reproducing the issue accurately. The environment where the script is executed seems to not have the `packaging` module installed, which is a dependency of Astropy (as indicated by the module import failure in the stack trace provided). 

Before proceeding to run the reproducer script in such environments, please ensure all dependencies, including `packaging`, are installed. If you're using a package manager like `conda` or `pip`, you can generally install the `packaging` module via:

```
pip install packaging
```
or
```
conda install packaging
```

However, assuming the environment setup issue can be resolved, the script provided earlier is designed to reproduce the issue as per the requirement. To clarify, the script is correct as provided for reproducing the described bug, assuming all dependencies are correctly installed.

Here is the `reproducer.py` script again for convenience, without modifications, as the initial request was for a script to reproduce a specific issue, which was met as per the provided outline:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_angle_pickle_to_string():
    import astropy.coordinates
    import pickle
    ang = astropy.coordinates.Angle(0.25 * astropy.units.hourangle)
    pang = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(ang))
    try:
        assert ang.to_string() == pang.to_string(), "Unpickled Angle.to_string fails"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_angle_pickle_to_string()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test failed.")
        exit(1)
    print("Test passed.")
    exit(0)
```

Please ensure the environment is correctly set up with all dependencies of Astropy (and its development version if testing with that) before running this script again.
