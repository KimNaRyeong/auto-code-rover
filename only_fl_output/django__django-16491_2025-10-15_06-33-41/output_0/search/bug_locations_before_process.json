The logic might need to explicitly handle `EmptyQuerySet` cases, ensuring that the SQL generated translates to a boolean expression that evaluates to `False` when the subquery is empty. This maintains the expected functionality of the `Exists` annotation, aligning with the assumption that an empty subquery should not exist, and thus, return `False`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `annotate` method, or underlying methods it calls (like `_annotate`), should ensure that annotations using `Exists` with `EmptyQuerySet` are correctly processed to return boolean values. While the method itself may not directly handle the logic of `Exists`, ensuring that the query construction process respects the `BooleanField` output requirement, even in the case of empty results, is essential. It might involve adding checks or transformations at the query construction stage where `EmptyQuerySet` influences the annotation result, specifically ensuring that an `Exists(EmptyQuerySet)` translates to a boolean `False` in SQL output, rather than `NULL`."
