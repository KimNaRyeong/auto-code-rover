To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue described, you would need to simulate a mini Django project environment first. Since we're dealing with database interactions and Django model annotations, this script will include essential Django setup steps like configuring settings, defining models, and performing database migrations in code. 

Here's how you can structure `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            "default": {
                "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
                "NAME": "db.sqlite3",
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=("__main__",),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

def main():
    try:
        # Run the steps to reproduce the issue here
        run_test_cases()
        print("Test passed. The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)

def run_test_cases():
    class A(models.Model):
        pass

    class B(models.Model):
        pass

    models_created = False
    try:
        A.objects.create()
        models_created = True
    except RuntimeError:
        # Models have not been migrated yet
        pass

    if not models_created:
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command("migrate", verbosity=0)

        # Creating instances after migrations
        A.objects.create()
        B.objects.create()

    # Case: should return False
    a_should_be_false = A.objects.annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool
    assert a_should_be_false is False, f"Expected False, got {a_should_be_false}"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_django_environment()
    main()
```

This script tries to be a minimal setup where it:

1. Sets up the Django environment programmatically with `settings.configure()` for an SQLite database.
2. Defines two simple Django models within the script to keep everything standalone.
3. Implements logic to handle initial migrations within the script. This is usually not recommended for a Django project but is done here to make the script self-contained.
4. Runs test cases where the issue is reproduced by annotating an `Exists` subquery and asserts the results.
5. Utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to report assertion errors comprehensively.

Please remember that dynamically performing migrations as shown here is a simplification for demonstration purposes. Normally, migrations are handled with dedicated management commands and not mixed into application logic.

To execute this script, you'd run: `python3 reproducerer.py` in your terminal.

**Important Note:** This script assumes you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install Django`) and that you're familiar with running Python scripts that interact with Django models and databases. The behavior of the script could vary depending on the Django version and the database backend specifics.
