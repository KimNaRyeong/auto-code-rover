Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` crafted to address the issue you've encountered. When executed, this script should attempt to reproduce the issue involving `io.fits.FITSDiff` incorrectly reporting differences between identical files, specifically when comparing a file containing Variable Length Arrays (VLAs). It utilizes Python's exception handling mechanisms to catch the AssertionError if the comparison fails (indicating a bug) and prints a detailed stack trace of the error using the provided function.

Please ensure that the requisite packages (i.e., Astropy) are correctly installed in your environment before running this script.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.io import fits

    try:
        # Step 1: Create FITS file with a VLA column
        col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
        hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
        hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

        # Step 2: Compare the file to itself using FITSDiff
        diff_result = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits')
        
        # Step 3: Check if the files are reported as identical
        if not diff_result.identical:
            print(diff_result.report())
            raise AssertionError("FITSDiff incorrectly reported differences.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the script executed the test correctly
    else:
        print("Passed: FITSDiff correctly identified the files as identical.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Execution Notes

- Ensure Astropy is installed: You can install it using pip (`pip install astropy`) if you haven't done so already.
- Run the script: Place `reproducer.py` at the root of your project and execute it using Python 3 (`python3 reproducer.py`). The script should work as intended, raising an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace if the issue is present, and exiting with code 0 if and when the issue is resolved, indicating no bug was detected.
- Environment Compatibility: This script is designed for environments with a functioning Python 3 interpreter and access to necessary libraries. Make sure your environment meets these requirements for accurate results.
