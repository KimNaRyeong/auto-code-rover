Now widget['attrs']['id'] contains the \"id\" we would like to use when rendering the label of our CheckboxSelectMultiple.\nHowever BoundWidget.id_for_label() is implemented as\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])\nignoring the id available through self.data['attrs']['id']. This re-implementation for rendering the \"id\" is confusing and presumably not intended. Nobody has probably realized that so far, because rarely the auto_id-argument is overridden when initializing a form. If however we do, one would assume that the method BoundWidget.id_for_label renders that string as specified through the auto_id format-string.\nBy changing the code from above to\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn self.data['attrs']['id']\nthat function behaves as expected.\nPlease note that this error only occurs when rendering the subwidgets of a widget of type CheckboxSelectMultiple. This has nothing to do with the method BoundField.id_for_label().\n</issue>"
