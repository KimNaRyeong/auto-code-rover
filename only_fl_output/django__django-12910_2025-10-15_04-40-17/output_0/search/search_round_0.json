That would prevent having do to the manual and error prone options['skip_checks'] dance. In all cases that should be done in a different PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding replacing `Command.requires_system_checks = True` with a more flexible approach that allows specifying either all checks, no checks, or a subset, the following API calls would be highly relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the class Command**: Understanding where the `Command` class is defined and any existing properties or methods related to system checks would provide foundational context. This class is likely where modifications are needed.\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. **Search for uses of requires_system_checks**: Finding the current implementations or references of `requires_system_checks` will help identify where changes need to be made to support the new `required_system_checks` attribute.\n   - `search_code(\"requires_system_checks = True\")`\n\n3. **Search for instances where skip_checks is manually handled**: Since the issue mentions an objective to avoid manual and error-prone `options['skip_checks']` implementations, identifying where these occur would be informative for proposing a comprehensive solution.\n   - `search_code(\"options['skip_checks']\")`"
