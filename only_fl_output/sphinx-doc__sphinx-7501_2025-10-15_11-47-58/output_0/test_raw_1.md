To address the issue where the script failed because the `phpmyadmin` directory already exists and to adapt the script to run from the root directory of the project (without cloning the repository again), the updated `reproducer.py` script is modified accordingly. This script assumes it is placed in the root directory of an already cloned `phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin` project and will directly work with the local files:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    # Ensure we are in the root directory of the project
    if not os.path.exists('doc') or not os.path.exists('.git'):
        raise OSError("This script should be run from the root directory of the phpMyAdmin project.")

    # Changing working directory to 'doc'
    os.chdir('doc')
    
    print("Installing Sphinx...")
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'Sphinx==3.0.0'])
    
    print("Building HTML documentation...")
    result = subprocess.run(['make', 'html'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    
    if "duplicate term description" in result.stderr:
        raise AssertionError("Duplicate term description found in glossary.rst")
    elif result.returncode != 0:
        print("Build finished with errors, but not the one we're looking for.")
        print("Error details:", result.stderr)
        raise Exception("Documentation build failed with errors.")
    else:
        print("No duplicate term description issue detected.")

try:
    reproduce_issue()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if issue is present or other errors encountered
else:
    print("Issue not found or resolved, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if issue is resolved or not detected
```

This script attempts to build the Sphinx documentation from the `doc` directory of the phpMyAdmin project. It no longer clones the repository, assuming it's already present. On encountering the specific issue (duplicate term description in `glossary.rst`), it raises an `AssertionError`. For any other build failure, it raises a generic exception with the error details but utilizes the same mechanism to print the stack trace for debugging purposes. This ensures clarity on whether the script fails due to the described issue or another unexpected error.
