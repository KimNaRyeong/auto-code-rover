Here are the appropriate APIs calls to start collecting the needed information:\n\n1. For understanding how `validate_key()` is implemented or expected to be called in various cache backends, and to confirm if it's indeed not called in the methods mentioned:\n   - `search_method(\"validate_key\")`\n\n2. To get specific implementation details about the methods where `validate_key()` is presumably missing:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"touch\", \"LocMemcache\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"delete_many\", \"BaseMemcachedCache\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"touch\", \"MemcachedCache\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"MemcachedCache\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"MemcachedCache\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"touch\", \"PyLibMCCache\")`\n\nEach of these API calls will provide us with the necessary context to understand how `validate_key()` is currently integrated within these methods and how it can be uniformly applied across all operations to prevent the described issue."
