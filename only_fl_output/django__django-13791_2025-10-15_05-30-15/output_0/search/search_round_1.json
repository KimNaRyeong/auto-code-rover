The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

Below is a breakdown of the questions based on the code provided:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `parse_duration` function parses a duration string into a `datetime.timedelta` object. It supports the preferred Django format ('%d %H:%M:%S.%f'), ISO 8601 representation, and PostgreSQL's day-time interval format. The function uses regular expressions to match the input string and extracts the duration components into a dictionary (`kw`). It handles the sign of the duration, adjusts microseconds precision, and makes sure negative signs are correctly applied to seconds if specified. The extracted components are then converted to float values, and respective `datetime.timedelta` objects are created for days and the rest of the components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds). Finally, it combines these timedeltas, taking into account the sign of the overall duration.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe reported bug is related to how this function handles negative durations that only include days. Specifically, the issue points to the final line of the method, `return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)`, where the sign of the duration is ignored if the input string only includes days. This is because the multiplication of the `sign` variable with the `datetime.timedelta` object constructed from the `kw` dictionary results in zero if the dictionary does not contain any components other than days, which have already been popped out to construct the `days` variable. Therefore, if `kw` results in a timedelta of zero, multiplying it by `-1` still gives zero, and thus, the sign is effectively ignored.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to correctly parse and reflect the sign of the duration even if the input string only contains days. That is, if the input string indicates a negative duration consisting solely of days (for example, \"-P2D\"), the function should return a `datetime.timedelta` object representing a negative duration of two days. To fix the bug, the code needs to ensure that the sign is correctly applied to the `days` variable before the final timedelta object is returned. This would likely require adjusting how the `days` timedelta is constructed or amended to correctly incorporate the sign for cases where the rest of the components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) are absent or zero."

Bug Location:\n   - File: django/utils/dateparse.py\n   - Method: parse_duration\n\nIntended Behavior:\nThe `parse_duration` method needs to be modified to ensure that the sign is correctly applied to durations that only consist of days. To achieve this, the calculation handling the final return value, specifically the line `return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)`, should be adjusted. This adjustment must ensure that the sign is incorporated into the `days` `datetime.timedelta` object before or during its creation, rather than relying on the final combination step, which does not work when `kw` results in a timedelta of zero duration. The change must preserve the existing functionality for all other cases (e.g., durations including hours, minutes, seconds, and/or microseconds, in addition to or instead of days) while correctly handling the sign for durations consisting solely of days. Essentially, the sign should directly influence the `days` timedelta, ensuring negative durations are properly represented even when only days are specified, without altering the method's behavior for parsing other components of the duration string."
