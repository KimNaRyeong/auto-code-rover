</code><intended_behavior>Although not a direct modification to a specific class or method within this file, the logic around signal definition or handling here may need revisiting to support the consumption and interpretation of the newly included deletion source context. This may not involve changing existing signal mechanics but ensuring that signals like pre_delete and post_delete can work with additional data (context about the deletion origin) passed to them.</intended_behavior>]
