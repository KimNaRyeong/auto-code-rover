However, when the colorbar is extended using extend='both', the black lines at the extremities do not show up.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import from_levels_and_colors\nmy_cmap = mpl.cm.viridis\nbounds = np.arange(10)\nnb_colors = len(bounds) + 1\ncolors = my_cmap(np.linspace(100, 255, nb_colors).astype(int))\nmy_cmap, my_norm = from_levels_and_colors(bounds, colors, extend='both')\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 1))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\ncbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=my_cmap, norm=my_norm, orientation='horizontal', drawedges=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=0.05, bottom=0.4, right=0.95, top=0.9)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254401-7516988d-1efb-4887-a631-de9a68357685.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254881-92c167b7-aa13-4972-9955-48221b38b866.png)\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.1\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gain a proper understanding and collect sufficient code context for resolving the issue concerning drawing edges on colorbars with extensions in Matplotlib, we should consider checking the implementation details of the colorbar and its related components. Based on the issue description, the relevant components are likely to involve the `ColorbarBase` class, where the colorbar is initially created and managed, and possibly methods related to drawing edges and handling the `extend` option. The functions `from_levels_and_colors` and `ColorbarBase` are explicitly mentioned in the code for reproduction, so we'll start by exploring these areas:\n\n1. Search for the `ColorbarBase` class definition to understand how colorbars are implemented.\n2. Look into the logic for `drawedges` within `ColorbarBase` to see how edges are drawn and why they might be missing at the extremities.\n3. Given that `from_levels_and_colors` is used to create the colormap and norm, investigating its implementation might offer some insights into how the `extend='both'` option is handled and how it might affect the drawing of edges.\n\nHere are the API calls we will use to gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"ColorbarBase\")`: To find where the `ColorbarBase` class is defined in the Matplotlib codebase.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"drawedges\", \"ColorbarBase\")`: To get details on how edges are drawn in the colorbar and identify any conditions that could prevent the drawing at extremities.\n- `search_code(\"from_levels_and_colors\")`: To check the implementation of `from_levels_and_colors` and understand how it handles the `extend` option.\n\nExecuting these searches should provide us with enough information to start drafting a fix for the issue."

        "content": "The search results provide an important insight and also indicate a need for adjusting our search strategy to gather more context effectively.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n- The API calls intended to find the `ColorbarBase` class and methods related to `drawedges` within it yielded no results. This outcome suggests either a misunderstanding of the internal structure of Matplotlib or perhaps an issue with the specifics of the search input (e.g., a typo, or the class might be defined in a module that wasn't directly searchable with the given API parameters).\n\n- The snippet from `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` for `from_levels_and_colors` gives us a starting point regarding how color maps and norms are created based on levels and colors, with an `extend` parameter that can be set to 'neither', 'both', and presumably 'min' or 'max'. This part is directly related to the issue since the bug manifests when the `extend='both'` option is used, suggesting that the way `from_levels_and_colors` handles the `extend` parameter might influence how the colorbar's boundaries are drawn or interpreted, but without the explicit connection to the drawing of boundary edges.\n\n### Adjusted Search Strategy\nGiven the unsuccessful attempts to find `ColorbarBase`, we need to reconsider our approach. There might be a couple of reasons for the failure: the class might be nested within another module or file that wasn't directly addressed, or there might have been a misinterpretation of its location. Considering Matplotlib's structure, it's plausible that the colorbar functionality is extensively divided across multiple files.\n\n1. **Revised API Calls**:\n    - **Search for ColorbarBase Again**: It\u2019s possible that the class is defined in a different context or indirectly through a component that wasn\u2019t captured by the initial search term. Exploring files related to colorbar handling could be helpful.\n    - **Direct Search in Likely Files**: Since `ColorbarBase` was not found directly, we can make assumptions about where it might be defined based on the structure of Matplotlib. For instance, colorbar related functionalities could be in a file named related to `colorbar.py` or similar.\n    - **Investigate Drawing Mechanism Further**: Given the specific issue with edge drawing, approaching this from another angle by looking for methods or functions related to `extend` options and how edges are drawn in general in the context of colorbars could be beneficial.\n\n2. **New API Calls to Consider**:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"class ColorbarBase\", \"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\")`: To try and locate the `ColorbarBase` class within a file that is likely to contain it based on the naming convention.\n    - `search_method(\"extend\")`: Since the `extend` option plays a critical role in the issue, exploring where and how it's used across the entire codebase might give clues on affecting the drawing of edges.\n\nGiven the failure to locate `ColorbarBase`, let\u2019s pivot our approach and directly search for files and methods that may deal with the `extend` functionality and edges drawing in colorbars more broadly. This strategy entails searching broadly across the codebase for related functionalities and not just targeting a specific class. This approach should hopefully provide insights into the mechanisms by which `extend` and edge drawing are implemented and interact, which is crucial for identifying the root cause of the bug."
