Given the feedback and the need to accurately reproduce and verify the presence of the stated issue, let's craft another attempt at a `reproducer.py`. The approach here aims to programmatically confirm whether edges at the extremities of the colorbar are not being drawn as expected when `drawedges=True` and `extend='both'` are set. This version will try to evaluate the condition directly related to the visibility of the edges at the colorbar's extremities.

Please find the updated standalone python file `reproducer.py`:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproducer():
    import matplotlib as mpl
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import from_levels_and_colors

    my_cmap = mpl.cm.viridis
    bounds = np.arange(10)
    nb_colors = len(bounds) + 1
    colors = my_cmap(np.linspace(0, 1, nb_colors))
    my_cmap, my_norm = from_levels_and_colors(bounds, colors, extend='both')

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 1))
    cbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=my_cmap,
                                      norm=my_norm,
                                      orientation='horizontal',
                                      drawedges=True)

    # Force a draw so we can inspect the colorbar's artists
    fig.canvas.draw()

    try:
        # Instead of inspecting visibility directly (which is a property that might not sufficiently capture the issue),
        # We inspect the edge lines by assessing the existence of drawn edges where expected.
        edge_lines = cbar.dividers.get_segments()
        if not edge_lines or len(edge_lines) < len(colors) - 1:
            raise AssertionError("Not all expected edges in the colorbar are visible.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the issue is reproduced
        
    print("Issue not found: Colorbar edges at extremities are correctly visible.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproducer()
```

This script performs a more nuanced check by directly examining the segments in the colorbar's divider lines. The expectation is that for a colorbar extended on both ends and with `drawedges=True`, there should be dividing lines corresponding to the edges between each color segment, including proper representation at the extremities. If this condition fails, the script raises an `AssertionError` and outputs a stack trace through the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If the condition regarding the edges is met, it suggests that the issue cited is not present, and the script exits with code 0, indicating success.
