        "intended_behavior": "The `Chr` class should explicitly specify that its output is expected to be a character string. To achieve this, an `output_field` attribute should be added to the class definition, initializing it with `CharField()`. This modification would inform Django's ORM to treat the result of the `CHR` function as text, eliminating the type mismatch leading to the `ValueError`. Furthermore, this change must preserve the function's existing database-specific implementations (`as_mysql`, `as_oracle`, `as_sqlite`), ensuring that it continues to work as intended across different database backends. The adjustment should be made in a way that aligns with Django's conventions for similar transformations, thus maintaining consistency within the framework. By implementing the intended behavior, the `Chr` class will correctly handle scenarios where it is used to transform integer values to their character equivalents, avoiding errors when users attempt to annotate models with character data derived from numeric inputs. This update ensures that the usage of `Chr` aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue, thereby resolving the reported bug."
