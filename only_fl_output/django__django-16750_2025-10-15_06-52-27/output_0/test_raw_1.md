Given the requirement and the issue encountered during the previous attempt, it appears that initializing the Django environment programmatically before defining any models or engaging in any other Django-specific operations can resolve the `AppRegistryNotReady` error. Taking this into consideration, the adjusted script is structured to ensure that the Django setup is performed correctly with minimal configuration, suitable for a standalone script execution context.

Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Configure Django for standalone script usage
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    ),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

from django.db import models
from django.db.models.functions import Chr
from django.db.models import Value

# Define a simple model to use for the test
class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # Mimic the operation that's causing issues
        TestModel.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value(77)))
        print("Issue is fixed, ValueError was not raised as expected.")
        return True
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not reproduce_issue():
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the issue is reproduced
    else:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if the issue does not occur
```

This script sets up Django to run in a standalone mode with an in-memory SQLite database, thus avoiding the `AppRegistryNotReady` error by calling `django.setup()` after configuring the settings but before using any of Django's components that require the framework to be fully initialized. It tries to reproduce the specified issue by performing the operation that has caused the error and handles both the reproduction and the potential absence (fix) of the problem as described.
