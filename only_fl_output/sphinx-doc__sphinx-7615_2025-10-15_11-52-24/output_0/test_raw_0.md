This script attempts to reproduce the reported Sphinx issue by creating a temporary Sphinx project with the problematic RST content and then building it. After the build, it asserts the HTML output to check if the issue is present, based on the expected behavior described in the issue. If the error is found, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and its stack trace will be printed. If Sphinx correctly renders the backslashes as expected, the script will exit with a message indicating no issues were detected.
