In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\n**To Reproduce**\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering.\n```\nTwo \\\\\nThree \\\\\\\nFour \\\\\\\\\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\n**Expected behavior**\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\n**Screenshots**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.6\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding Sphinx's handling of backslashes in comparison to Docutils, we need to narrow our investigation to the components involved in parsing and rendering RST (reStructuredText) content. Given the information, the likely suspects include the parsing logic, potentially a specific visitor pattern for rendering, or even the way escape sequences are processed. Here are the API calls we can make to gather more context:\n\n1. We need to understand how Sphinx extends or utilizes Docutils for parsing RST. Thus, we should look for classes or methods in Sphinx that are responsible for parsing RST.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"RSTParser\")\n    search_method(\"parse\")\n    ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions incorrect rendering of backslashes which is fundamental to escape sequences, identifying code related to escape sequence handling might be useful.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"escape sequence\")\n    search_code(\"\\\\\\\\\")\n    ```\n\n3. Given that Sphinx could modify or extend the behavior of Docutils, identifying how Sphinx renders text blocks might provide insights.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"render\")\n    search_code(\"visit_textblock\")\n    ```\n\nThese calls are designed to help isolate where Sphinx might be diverging from Docutils or mishandling backslashes during the rendering process."
