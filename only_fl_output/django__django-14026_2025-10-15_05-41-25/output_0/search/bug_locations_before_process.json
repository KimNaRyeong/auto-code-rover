This behavior should ensure that when the Sum function is called, if the result is NULL due to no applicable data, it returns this default value instead of NULL. This modification should be implemented in such a way that it does not disrupt the existing functionality for users who rely on the current behavior (i.e., receiving NULL by default)."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the annotate method to support a mechanism through which it can gracefully handle and apply default values for aggregation results, specifically in conjunction with the Sum method (and potentially other aggregation methods). This would likely involve integrating the handling of the default value option provided in the Sum class into the query construction process within annotate. The objective is to preserve the existing behavior of annotate while allowing for the specification of default values for aggregations that can return NULL, thereby providing a seamless experience for developers looking to avoid NULL aggregation results without external workarounds."
