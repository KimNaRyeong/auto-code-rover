        "intended_behavior": "The method should include a preprocessing check to convert boolean arrays to a numeric type (e.g., float) before they are used in calculations or passed to other functions/methods like _huber_loss_and_gradient. This conversion should occur immediately after input validation steps to ensure that all further operations on X work with numerical data, thus avoiding type-related operations that are not supported with boolean types. This change should be transparent to the user, not affecting the public API or the method signature. It should also not alter the behavior for inputs that are already in a numeric format. It's important that this behavior change does not impact performance for non-boolean inputs. Therefore, the conversion should be conditioned on the detection of boolean data types. A comment should be added above the conversion operation explaining the reason for the conversion (i.e., to prevent type errors during optimization with boolean predictors)."
