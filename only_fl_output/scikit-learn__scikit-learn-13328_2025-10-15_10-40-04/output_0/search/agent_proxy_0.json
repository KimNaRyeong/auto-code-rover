            "content": "To address the issue reported regarding the `TypeError` when fitting `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors, we can take the following steps to gather more context from the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the `HuberRegressor` class to find in which file it is defined.\n2. Search for the `fit` method within the `HuberRegressor` class to understand how it handles the data types of `X`.\n3. Since the error mentions the use of the numpy boolean negative and suggests using the `~` operator or the `logical_not` function instead, it would be insightful to locate where this operation is happening within the context of the `HuberRegressor` class or its methods. The traceback points towards operations involving calculation of gradients and handling outliers, possibly in a method named `_huber_loss_and_gradient` or similar.\n4. The traceback also mentions `_minimize_lbfgsb` from `scipy.optimize.lbfgsb.py` as part of the call stack, but this is likely a downstream issue triggered by the input from `sklearn`, so modifying SciPy's code is outside the scope. Focus should remain on how `scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b` is called and with what parameters from within the `sklearn` implementation.\n5. Finally, gathering context on how the `fit` method interacts with boolean arrays or how it calls optimization routines with the input data (`X`) will be critical.\n\nBased on these steps, the following API calls will provide the necessary code context to understand and start addressing the issue:\n\n- `search_class(\"HuberRegressor\")`: To locate the file where `HuberRegressor` is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"HuberRegressor\")`: To inspect the implementation details of the `fit` method within the `HuberRegressor` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_huber_loss_and_gradient\", \"HuberRegressor\")`: Assuming the private method involved in the traceback is part of `HuberRegressor`, to understand how boolean arrays are handled.\n\nThese API calls focus on understanding the implementation of `HuberRegressor` and specifically how it processes input data types, which is at the core of the reported issue."
