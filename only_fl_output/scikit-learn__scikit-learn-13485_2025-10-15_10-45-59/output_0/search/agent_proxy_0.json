Considering the mention of `check_array` not supporting 3D inputs and its comparison with `GridSearchCV`, we need to ascertain the implementation details of `CalibratedClassifierCV`, particularly how it interacts with `check_array`. \n\nWe should perform the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CalibratedClassifierCV\")`: This will help locate the file or files where `CalibratedClassifierCV` is defined, which is essential for understanding its implementation.\n\n2. `search_method(\"check_array\")`: Since the issue revolves around the usage of `check_array` within `CalibratedClassifierCV`, finding all references to `check_array` might provide insight into how it's typically used in the context of scikit-learn estimators and whether it\u2019s a pattern that could/should be adjusted for 3D inputs."
