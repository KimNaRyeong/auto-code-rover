If we could, I'd be happy to provide a PR to do so\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. `CalibratedClassifierCV` Class Context\nThe `CalibratedClassifierCV` class is defined in `sklearn/calibration.py` and inherits from `BaseEstimator` and `ClassifierMixin`. It has several methods, including `__init__`, `fit`, `predict_proba`, and `predict`. These methods facilitate its functionality as a meta-estimator for calibrating classifiers to provide more accurate probability estimates. Given the issue context related to being intolerant to 3D inputs, it's likely the `fit` method or somewhere similarly fundamental where `check_array` might be invoked to validate inputs.\n\n### 2. `check_array` Method Context\nThe `check_array` function, defined in `sklearn/utils/validation.py`, is a utility for validating input arrays, ensuring they meet specific criteria (e.g., 2D shape, finite values, minimum samples/features). It's quite flexible, offering parameters like `accept_sparse`, `force_all_finite`, `ensure_2d`, and `allow_nd`, which control how strict the checking is. The `ensure_2d=True` default parameter makes it clear why `CalibratedClassifierCV` cannot accept 3D inputs by default, as `check_array` is set up to raise an error if an input isn't 2D unless `allow_nd` is explicitly set to `True`.\n\n### Relationship Between `check_array` and the Bug\nThe issue stems from the use of `check_array` within `CalibratedClassifierCV`, likely in a way that enforces 2D inputs (`ensure_2d=True`) without an option to override this for 3D input. Given the `check_array` method has an `allow_nd` parameter, a modification to the way `CalibratedClassifierCV` uses `check_array` could potentially resolve the issue by allowing 3D data structures.\n\n### Intended Behavior in Context of the Issue\nConsidering the issue at hand, the intended behavior would be for `CalibratedClassifierCV` to gracefully handle 3D inputs, similar to how other meta-estimators (like `GridSearchCV`) operate without rigid input dimensionality restrictions. This adjustment would involve tweaking the parameters passed to `check_array` when validating inputs in `CalibratedClassifierCV` (likely in the `fit` method), specifically setting `ensure_2d=False` and `allow_nd=True` as necessary to accommodate 3D inputs.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step to gather more pinpointed context would be to examine how `CalibratedClassifierCV` calls `check_array`. This involves looking into the `fit` method within `CalibratedClassifierCV`:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/calibration.py\")`: This would reveal the specific usage of `check_array` within the `fit` method context of `CalibratedClassifierCV` and clarify how the existing implementation could be adjusted to accommodate 3D inputs."

This could be achieved by adjusting the parameters passed to `check_array`, making `ensure_2d=False` and `allow_nd=True`. This change would enable `CalibratedClassifierCV` to accept 3D inputs by being more flexible with the input shape, aligning with the behavior of other meta-estimators like `GridSearchCV`. It's crucial that this modification preserves existing functionality for 2D inputs to ensure that the utility of `CalibratedClassifierCV` isn't diminished for use cases that already work. This might involve checking the dimensionality of the input and conditionally setting these parameters so that 2D inputs are still handled as they are currently, while also supporting 3D inputs where necessary."
