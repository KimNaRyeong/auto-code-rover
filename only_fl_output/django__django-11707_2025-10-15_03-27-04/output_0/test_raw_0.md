Below is a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue as described. This script assumes you have a Django environment set up with at least two models, `Group` and `Event`, with a field `group_id` in the `Event` model that references `Group`. Please adjust the model imports and setup accordingly to your project's structure before running the script.

```python
import os
import pickle
import django
from django.db import models

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

# Import your models here, adjust import paths as per your project's structure.
from your_app.models import Group, Event

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        groups = Group.objects.annotate(
            has_event=models.Exists(Event.objects.filter(group_id=models.OuterRef('id')))
        )
        with django.test.TestCase().assertNumQueries(0):
            pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(groups.query))
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError:
        print("The issue is present.")
        exit(1)
```

Please make sure:
- Django is properly configured, and your project's settings are correctly set up.
- Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the path to your Django project settings.
- Replace `your_app.models` with the correct import path where your `Group` and `Event` models are defined.
- This script checks whether pickle attempts to evaluate the queryset when pickling. If it does so without raising an `AssertionError`, then the issue is present. If the script executes without any exceptions, it suggests that the issue has been resolved.

Running this script in your project root should allow you to verify whether the Django version you are using still has the issue described.
