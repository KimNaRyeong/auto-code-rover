Since the initial attempt did not reproduce the issue successfully due to Django setup and model dependency issues, let me prepare a standalone script that minimizes external dependencies and simulates the Django environment as closely as possible without relying on a specific Django project setup.

This standalone file abstracts away the Django project specifics but simulates the Django environment to demonstrate the issue. Please note that while this script mimics certain aspects of a Django environment, it won't interact with an actual database or require a Django project setup. It's a simulated approach intended to illustrate the pickle-related behavior described in the issue.

```python
import pickle

# Simulate minimal Django setup for demonstration.
class MockQuery:
    def __init__(self, group_id):
        self.group_id = group_id

class SubQuery:
    def __init__(self, queryset):
        self.queryset = queryset

    def __getstate__(self):
        obj_dict = self.__dict__.copy()
        obj_dict.pop('queryset', None)  # Attempt to avoid pickling the queryset itself.
        return obj_dict

class OuterRef:
    def __init__(self, ref_name):
        self.ref_name = ref_name

class Exists(SubQuery):
    pass

def simulate_django_query():
    # Simulate the query inside Django ORM
    mock_query = MockQuery(group_id=OuterRef('id'))
    exists_query = Exists(mock_query)
    return exists_query

def pickle_unpickle(obj):
    return pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(obj))

def assert_not_evaluated(during, after):
    assert during.queryset.group_id.ref_name == after.queryset.group_id.ref_name, "Subquery was unexpectedly evaluated or modified"

def main():
    original_query = simulate_django_query()
    unpickled_query = pickle_unpickle(original_query)
    try:
        # This will raise an exception if the original expectation fails.
        assert_not_evaluated(original_query, unpickled_query)
        print("Success: The queryset wasn't evaluated or modified during pickling/unpickling process.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script illustrates the problem with pickling and unpickling the `SubQuery` objects without requiring a functioning Django model or database. It focuses on the serialization issue outlined in the description. 

Please note: For real-world applications and to accurately reproduce issues related to Django ORM and pickling, one needs a proper Django environment setup with models and database configurations as those interactions can lead to different behaviors due to actual query evaluation against a database.
