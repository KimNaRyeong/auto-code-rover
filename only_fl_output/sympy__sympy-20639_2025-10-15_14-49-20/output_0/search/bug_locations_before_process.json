When encountering an expression such as pi**(1/E), the method should retain the base and exponent structure without simplification that leads to inaccurate representation. This means specifically detecting combinations of constants and their exponents that are known to produce incorrect simplifications and handling them in a way that preserves the mathematical intent and accuracy."
