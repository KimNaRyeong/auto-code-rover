This script attempts to create a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles, expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, as described in the issue. The `print_stacktrace` function is utilized to provide a detailed output of the exception if it is raised, helping to pinpoint the issue in the code.

**Note:** This reproducer is built based on the provided instructions and the premise of an issue existing within a fictional `Permutation` class, which is not part of Python's standard library or commonly known third-party libraries. Thus, for an actual project, the `Permutation` class specifics and behavior would need to align with the project's implementation details.
