        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should be enhanced to correctly handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them sequentially. The method should not raise a `ValueError` when encountering non-unique elements across different cycles during the construction process. Instead, it should allow the construction of permutations from these non-disjoint cycles, applying them one after the other to form the final permutation object. This involves potentially modifying the validation logic to permit non-unique elements if they are part of separate cycles in the input and adjusting the permutation construction logic to apply these cycles in the given order.\n\nThis adjustment preserves existing functionalities for inputs that already conform to the expected unique elements requirement or are given in array form or as single cycles. It extends the capabilities of the `Permutation` class to support a broader range of inputs, making it more flexible and useful for situations where permutations from non-disjoint cycles need to be generated.\n\nThe solution should ensure no adverse effects on other methods that rely on the `__new__` method for object creation, maintaining overall class integrity and performance. Existing unit tests (if any) should be reviewed and potentially extended to cover this new input scenario, ensuring backward compatibility and correctness across the class's usage."
