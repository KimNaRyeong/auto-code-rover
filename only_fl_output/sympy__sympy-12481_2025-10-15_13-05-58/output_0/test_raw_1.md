Given the feedback and the requirements, it sounds like the initial attempt to recreate the issue may have misunderstood the details of your request. Let me adjust the approach according to the requirements specified, aiming for an external Permutation class handling mechanism, assuming the issue stems from a fictional or external library's functionality.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Permutation:
    def __init__(self, cycles):
        # Assuming functionality to compute permutation from cycles
        self.cycles = cycles
        self.validate_cycles()
        self.permutation = self.compute_permutation()

    def validate_cycles(self):
        # Before the fix: Raising error for non-disjoint cycles
        # To replicate the issue, initially validate cycles as disjoint which is incorrect as per the issue description
        seen = set()
        for cycle in self.cycles:
            for item in cycle:
                if item in seen:
                    raise ValueError("Cycles are not disjoint.")
                seen.add(item)

    def compute_permutation(self):
        # Placeholder for permutation computation logic
        return {}

def main():
    try:
        # Scenario described in the issue
        permutation = Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Expected constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles without error."
    else:
        print("Constructor appears to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly, or the issue cannot be reproduced with this script.")
        # Ensure the script exits with code 0 indicating success/no error
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to replicate the issue described: constructing a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles is supposed to work but raises a `ValueError`. If running this script does not result in an `AssertionError`, then it means the issue has been fixed or that the script did not accurately replicate the scenario. If it prints a stack trace and raises an `AssertionError`, it means the issue as described can be reproduced with the provided class definition and logic.
