        "content": "To address the issue described, I will need to investigate the implementation details of several components within the SymPy codebase. Here are the API calls that I predict will provide the necessary context:\n\n1. **SymPy's `__eq__` implementation in `Expr` class**: The error trace suggests that the method `__eq__` within an `Expr`-derived class (or the `Expr` class itself) is involved. I'll search for the `Expr` class and the `__eq__` method inside it to understand how equality is checked and how it ends up evaluating string representations.\n\n2. **`sympify` function where the issue potentially originates**: The error trace mentions `sympify`, which seems to be a key function in the process that leads to the attempt to `eval` unknown string representations. Investigating its implementation might show why it decides to `eval` passed objects and whether there's an alternative approach that could be used.\n\n3. **`parse_expr` function and related context**: Given that `parse_expr` in `sympy_parser.py` is directly mentioned in the trace and is part of the process that evaluates expressions, a closer look at this function will be important for understanding how expressions are parsed and evaluated and thus how the unwanted `eval` is being triggered.\n\n4. **Searching for the code snippet that results in the error**: Directly searching for the snippet that causes the error (the evaluation part) might help pinpoint where exactly the dangerous `eval` is being called, and thus how we might avoid it.\n\nHere are the API calls according to the plan:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Expr\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"Expr\")\nsearch_method(\"sympify\")\nsearch_method(\"parse_expr\")\nsearch_code(\"expr = eval(\")\n```"
