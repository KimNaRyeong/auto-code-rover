        "content": "To address the issue of adding a `--skip-checks` option to the `runserver` command in a Django project, we need to gather code context regarding the command's implementation. Specifically, we should:\n\n1. Identify the class that implements the `runserver` command in Django.\n2. Determine how command-line options are defined and handled within this class.\n3. Understand the mechanism by which system checks are triggered during the execution of the `runserver` command.\n\nFirst, we'll start by searching for the class that implements the `runserver` command.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"runserver\")\n```\n\nNext, assuming the `runserver` command is defined within a known file (let's say it's `base_command.py` for illustration purposes), we would look for the method that parses and handles command-line options. This is a hypothetical file name used for demonstration purposes only.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"add_arguments\", \"base_command.py\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, to understand how system checks are integrated into the command execution, we need to look for relevant code that triggers the checks. \n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"check\")\nsearch_code(\"SystemCheckError\")\n```\n\nIf the project follows Django's typical structure, the actual triggering of checks might occur in a method that is part of the command execution flow, such as `handle` or something similar.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"runserver\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide the necessary context to start addressing the issue by identifying where to add the `--skip-checks` option and how to bypass the system checks when this option is used."
