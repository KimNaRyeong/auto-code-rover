Support mathjax 3.0
[MathJax 3.0 was released mid last year](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html), and has a number of improvements - most notably on the speed of loading (something like an 80% decrease in load time). It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.

The [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements. What do folks think?
