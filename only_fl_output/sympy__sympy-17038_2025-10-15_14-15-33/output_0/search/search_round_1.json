        "content": "<issue>isqrt gives incorrect results\nThe `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:\n```\n>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt\n>>> n = 4503599761588224\n>>> s = isqrt(n)\n>>> s  # correct result is 67108864\n67108865\n>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True\nFalse\n```\nor\n```\n>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999\n100000000\n```\nVersions: Python 3.7.3, SymPy 1.4, macOS 10.14.5\n## Analysis\nFor small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):\n```\nif n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\nreturn int(_sqrt(n))\n```\nThe main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.\n*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.\nIf we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of \"smallish\" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)\nWhether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.\nIn the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.\nI guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from `sympy/core/power.py` concerning the `isqrt` function:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `isqrt` function aims to return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the input `n`. Within the function, there's a conditional check to determine the method used for calculating the square root. If `n` is smaller than a predefined threshold (`17984395633462800708566937239552`), it uses `int(_sqrt(n))` for the computation, which relies on Python's `math.sqrt` function (aliased to `_sqrt`) and then converts the result to an integer. For inputs larger than this threshold, it falls back to a more precise, integer-based square root calculation method, `integer_nthroot(int(n), 2)[0]`, which ensures accurate results for very large integers where floating-point precision would be inadequate.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The bug arises in scenarios where the chosen threshold and the computation method (`int(_sqrt(n))`) lead to inaccurate results due to the limitations of floating-point precision. Specifically, the given examples (`n = 4503599761588224` and `n = 9999999999999999`) indicate that the conditional threshold and/or the computation method (`int(_sqrt(n))`) do not adequately account for inaccuracies in `math.sqrt`'s floating-point calculations. This results in off-by-one errors for square roots of large numbers that are close to floating-point precision limits.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- The intended behavior would be for `isqrt` to always return the truly largest integer that does not exceed the square root of `n`, accommodating the precision challenges that arise when working with large integers. This includes correctly handling edge cases around the precision boundary, ensuring that `s**2 <= n` always holds true when `s` is the output of `isqrt(n)`. The adjustment should either recalibrate the threshold to a safe value that accounts for floating-point precision limits (possibly `2**52 + 2**27`, based on the analysis) or refine the computation method to ensure accuracy when `n` is close to the threshold, by possibly introducing a check after the initial square root calculation to verify the correctness of the result and adjust if necessary.\n\nGiven these insights, further action to resolve the bug might involve adjusting the threshold value and enhancing the accuracy of the `int(_sqrt(n))` computation or its subsequent validation to ensure it always adheres to the definition and expectations laid out for `isqrt`."

To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should involve:\n\n- Re-evaluating and possibly adjusting the threshold from `17984395633462800708566937239552` to a safer boundary that accurately reflects the limits of floating-point precision (potentially adjusting it to `4503599761588224` or `2**52 + 2**27` as suggested in the issue analysis).\n- Introducing a post-processing verification step that checks if the returned square root, when squared, is greater than `n`. If it is, decrement the result by 1 to ensure it fits the condition `s**2 <= n`.\n- Alternatively, the method's condition for using `math.sqrt` could be refined to ensure it only applies within a bound guaranteed to preserve accuracy, given the limitations of floating-point arithmetic. This might involve a more conservative estimate of where floating-point precision is reliable, based on the assumption of IEEE 754 binary64 format for Python floats and the accuracy of `math.sqrt` across different platforms.\n- It may also be prudent to include a more direct fallback or adjustment within the computational path that uses `math.sqrt`, ensuring that edge cases near the boundary of floating-point precision are correctly handled, potentially through checking and correcting the result before returning it. This ensures that the function's behavior remains consistent and accurate across the full range of possible input values.\n\nThese adjustments aim to maintain the efficiency of the method for smaller values of `n` while ensuring its accuracy and reliability for larger inputs, directly addressing the discrepancies raised in the bug report."
