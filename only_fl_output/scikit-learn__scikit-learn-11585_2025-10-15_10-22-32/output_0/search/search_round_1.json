        "content": "<issue>SparsePCA incorrectly scales results in .transform()\n#### Description\nWhen using `SparsePCA`, the `transform()` method incorrectly scales the results based on the *number of rows* in the data matrix passed.\n#### Proposed Fix\nI am regrettably unable to do a pull request from where I sit. The issue is with this chunk of code, as of writing this at [line number 179 in sparse_pca.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py#L179):\n```python\nU = ridge_regression(self.components_.T, X.T, ridge_alpha,\nsolver='cholesky')\ns = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\ns[s == 0] = 1\nU /= s\nreturn U\n```\nI honestly do not understand the details of the chosen implementation of SparsePCA. Depending on the objectives of the class, making use of the features as significant for unseen examples requires one of two modifications. Either (a) **learn** the scale factor `s` from the training data (i.e., make it an instance attribute like `.scale_factor_`), or (b) use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` to remove the number-of-examples dependency.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA\nimport numpy as np\ndef get_data( count, seed ):\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ncol1 = np.random.random(count)\ncol2 = np.random.random(count)\ndata = np.hstack([ a[:,np.newaxis] for a in [\ncol1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n-col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\ncol2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n]])\nreturn data\ntrain = get_data(1000,1)\nspca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)\nresults_train = spca.fit_transform( train )\ntest = get_data(10,1)\nresults_test = spca.transform( test )\nprint( \"Training statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_train.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_train.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_train.min() )\nprint( \"Testing statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_test.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_test.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_test.min() )\n```\nOutput:\n```\nTraining statistics:\nmean:       -0.009\nmax:        0.067\nmin:       -0.080\nTesting statistics:\nmean:       -0.107\nmax:        0.260\nmin:       -0.607\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe test results min/max values are on the same scale as the training results.\n#### Actual Results\nThe test results min/max values are much larger than the training results, because fewer examples were used. It is trivial to repeat this process with various sizes of training and testing data to see the relationship.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in light of the SparsePCA scaling issue:\n\n### 1. SparsePCA Class Overview\n\n- The `SparsePCA` class is found within `sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py` and includes methods related to the Sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. It inherits from `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`, indicating it is designed to fit a model to data and transform it based on learned parameters.\n- The class initialization (`__init__`) includes parameters such as `n_components`, `alpha`, `ridge_alpha`, etc., which configure the behavior of the PCA.\n- The `fit` method prepares the model based on training data (`X`), and the `transform` method applies the learned model to transform data (`X`).\n\n### 2. transform Method\n\n- This method implements the transformation of input data `X` into a new space defined by the Sparse PCA components. The `ridge_alpha` parameter, used for ridge shrinkage in case of under-determined systems, plays a critical role here.\n- In versions before 0.21, `ridge_alpha` could be specified both during the class instantiation and within the `transform` method directly. However, it's slated for removal from the `transform` method arguments to emphasize its pre-specification in the class constructor.\n- The contentious code block (around line 179) pertains to the normalization/scale adjustment of the results obtained after the ridge regression of `X` against the PCA components.\n\n### 3. Issue Analysis and Intended Behavior\n\nThe issue points to how the scaling (or normalization) of the transformed data is handled, specifically criticizing the use of `.sum(axis=0)` for scaling data, which inadvertently introduces a dependency on the number of examples.\n\nThe current behavior results in rescaling the transformed data (`U`) by the square root of the sum of squares of `U` across its columns. This scaling method does not take into account the varying sizes of input data, leading to a disparity in the output scale between different-sized datasets.\n\nThe intended behavior, as suggested in the issue, could involve one of two changes to mitigate the impact of the input data size:\n\n- **Option a:** Learn the scale factor `s` during the fitting process and make it an instance attribute. This approach would ensure that the scaling factor is consistent across different-sized datasets, using the scale identified during training for all transformations.\n- **Option b:** Adjust the current scaling mechanism to use the mean (`np.mean`) rather than the sum, which inherently normalizes the scale factor `s` with the number of examples, thus removing the undesirable dependency on dataset size.\n\nGiven this understanding, a patch should modify the transformation process to either learn the scaling factor during fitting or revise the scaling calculation to mitigate the issue. This change is crucial for maintaining consistent scaling of the transformed data regardless of the size of the input dataset."

This involves addressing the issue within the code segment specifically around the calculation and application of the scale factor `s`. \n\n   One potential fix (Option a) could be to learn the scale factor `s` during the model's fit process and save it as an instance attribute (e.g., `self.scale_factor_`). This scale factor would then be used within the `transform` method to scale the transformed data. \n\n   Alternatively (Option b), changing the calculation from using `.sum(axis=0)` to `.mean(axis=0)` (or a similar adjustment that avoids scaling by the number of examples) would mitigate the issue. This change adjusts the scale factor to not depend on the dataset size, ensuring consistency across different dataset sizes.\n\n   In either approach, care must be taken to preserve the existing functionality for users not impacted by this issue, ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining the algorithm's efficacy in reducing dimensionality and handling sparse data effectively. \n\n   A review of how the modification impacts the overall algorithm's performance and correctness, particularly in edge cases or when used in conjunction with other parts of the library, would be critical to ensure the robustness of the change."
