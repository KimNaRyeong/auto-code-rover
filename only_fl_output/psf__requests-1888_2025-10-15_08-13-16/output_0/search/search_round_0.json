I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.\nI Wrote this test:\n```\ndef test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):\nrequests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')\n```\nand this is the result of py.test:\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = <OpenSSL.SSL.Connection object at 0x000000000345CC50>\nbuf = u'GET /redirect/1 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: httpbin.org\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, defl...cept: */*\\r\\nUser-Agent: python-r\nequests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Windows/8\\r\\n\\r\\n'\nflags = 0\ndef sendall(self, buf, flags=0):\n\"\"\"\nSend \"all\" data on the connection.

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will perform the following API calls to gather more context about the code structure, particularly focusing on the `requests` library and its interaction with `urllib3` and `pyopenssl`, as well as the handling of redirects and encodings.\n\n1. Since the description mentions that the URL is decoded to a Unicode string in `requests.adapters.py` around the handling of a `301` response, let's get the context of the code there:\n   - `get_code_around_line(file_path=\"requests/adapters.py\", line_number=181, window_size=10)`\n\n2. The issue description points to a problem occurring when the URL, after being decoded, is passed on to `resolve_redirects`, implying this method might call or interact with urllib3 in a way that ends up passing Unicode strings to pyOpenSSL. We need more context about `resolve_redirects`:\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"resolve_redirects\")`\n\n3. Given that pyOpenSSL raises a TypeError about expecting byte strings but receives a Unicode string instead, there's an evident need for understanding the data flow into pyOpenSSL. We should look into how `sendall` is invoked with urllib3 and pyOpenSSL:\n   - `search_method_in_class(method_name=\"sendall\", class_name=\"Connection\")`\n   - Since the problem involves a type check, it would be useful to see how `buf` is handled before it reaches `sendall`:\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"if isinstance(buf, _memoryview):\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a detailed view into how redirects and HTTP methods interact across these libraries, pinpoint where Unicode strings might erroneously be passed around instead of byte strings, and clarify the handling of HTTP request bodies within the SSL connection establishment."
