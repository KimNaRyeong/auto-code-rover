Based on your specific request to reproduce an issue related to a 301 redirect that triggers a `TypeError` from within the `pyOpenSSL` library when using certain packages, the following `reproducer.py` Python script attempts to directly replicate this situation. This script includes the specified function for printing a stack trace if the error occurs, as requested:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # This line attempts to trigger the issue by requesting a URL known to respond with a 301 redirect.
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If no exception was raised, we assume the issue could not be reproduced.
        print("Issue could not be reproduced.")
    except Exception as e:
        # If an exception was caught, we'll check if it's related to the issue we expect.
        if isinstance(e, TypeError) and str(e) == "buf must be a byte string":
            # If the exception matches our criteria, we acknowledge the issue's reproduction.
            raise AssertionError("Issue successfully reproduced.") from e
        else:
            # If the exception doesn't match, we print the stack trace for debugging.
            print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        # If an AssertionError was raised, we print its message.
        print(ae)
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        # The script exits with code 0 when the issue is reproduced.
        import sys
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script when executed as `python3 reproducer.py` should, according to the issue description, attempt to perform an HTTP GET request which is expected to result in a 301 response. Upon handling this response, due to the mentioned library versions and error, a `TypeError` should be triggered. The script checks for this specific type of error and confirms the issue's presence, subsequently exiting with code 0 if the issue can indeed be reproduced based on the conditions provided.

Please note that the exact reproduction of the issue as described depends on the environmental setup and the versions of the libraries involved (`cryptography`, `ndg-httpsclient`, `pyOpenSSL`, `pyasn1`, and potentially even `requests` itself). Adjustments to the environment or package versions might be necessary to closely replicate the specified conditions.
