Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the issue you've described. It will make a request to a URL that responds with a `301` redirect. The issue as described manifests when the request library passes a Unicode string instead of a byte string to lower levels (like `urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL`), eventually causing a `TypeError` in `pyOpenSSL`.

`reproducer.py` attempts to trigger the issue and catches the `TypeError` to print a stack trace. It asserts the presence of the issue if the exception is caught, demonstrating the problem you've outlined.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        # Attempt to trigger the bug with a request that will redirect
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If the request does not raise an error, we assume the issue is fixed
        print("No issue detected, the bug seems to be fixed.")
        return True
    except TypeError as te:
        # If a TypeError is caught, print the stack trace and assert the presence of the issue
        print_stacktrace(te)
        return False

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert not test_pyopenssl_redirect(), "The issue is still present, check the stack trace above."
```
When you run this script with `python3 reproducer.py` in your root directory, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue you've described is replicated, showing that the bug is present. It also prints a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

Remember, for the issue to be accurately reproduced, your environment must match the one described (with the specific versions of `pyOpenSSL`, `cryptography`, `ndg-httpsclient`, and `pyasn1` installed). If those specific versions are not in use or if any updates to the libraries involved have addressed the issue, the script might not trigger the error as expected.
