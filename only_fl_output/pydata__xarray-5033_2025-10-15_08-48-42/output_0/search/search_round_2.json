Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

This function is a wrapper around `open_dataset`, suggesting that `open_dataset` might be where the `engine` parameter, if it exists, is utilized or that this functionality ties indirectly to how external backends might be handled.\n\n    - **What does this part of the code do?** The provided code snippet loads a dataset into memory, potentially handling different data sources or formats by delegating to `open_dataset`, which is likely responsible for the actual opening of the dataset, potentially leveraging the `engine` parameter there.\n    - **Relationship to the issue**: The issue concerns itself with the simplification of adding custom backends for opening datasets, specifically suggesting enhancements around how the `engine` parameter is used. While the snippet doesn\u2019t directly mention the `engine` parameter, the delegation to `open_dataset` hints that `open_dataset` might be the actual interface where such an enhancement could be implemented.\n    - **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the `open_dataset` (and possibly `load_dataset`) methods would be capable of accepting a function or class directly via the `engine` parameter, bypassing the current string-based engine resolution mechanism to more intuitively support custom backends.\n\n2. **Search results on \"engine parameter\", \"register backend\", and \"setup.py\"**: The inability to find references using these search terms suggests that the current approach to handling backends and the `engine` parameter might not be straightforward or is handled in a less direct manner than the issue submitter assumed. It might be necessary to look into how the `open_dataset` method works, given that `load_dataset` defers to it for actual dataset opening operations.\n\nGiven these observations, the next steps in the investigation should likely involve:\n\n- Directly examining the `open_dataset` method to understand its current handling of the `engine` parameter and how it interfaces with different backends. This would clarify whether the `engine` parameter is indeed handled in a manner that restricts the straightforward addition of custom backends as functions directly.\n\nFor further context, the following API calls would be pertinent:\n\n1. `search_method(\"open_dataset\")`: This will provide direct insight into how datasets are opened, how the `engine` parameter is currently parsed, and how it could potentially be enhanced to support the feature request.\n\nThis step is crucial for aligning the project's capabilities with the feature request described in the issue, specifically enabling easier addition and use of custom backends by directly passing functions or classes instead of relying on a pre-registered engine name string."

The mention of specific backends (e.g., `netCDF4_`, `cfgrib_`, `h5netcdf_`, etc.) implies that `open_dataset` serves as a central method for interfacing with different file formats and backend engines. These methods are likely tailored to handle the specifics of each data format, leveraging distinct backends to read or write data efficiently.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n    The `open_dataset` methods distributed across various backend files are specialized implementations for opening datasets using different engines. The variation across these files suggests that each backend has customized logic for handling its particular data format. The implementation in `api.py` acts as a high-level entry point that delegates to these backend-specific methods based on the `engine` parameter or filename extension.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n    The issue at hand is not really a \"bug\" but a feature request to simplify the addition of custom backends by allowing a direct pass-through of functions or objects via the `engine` parameter, instead of relying on a pre-defined, string-identified engine. The current backend mechanism, inferred to be spread across various backend-specific implementations and potentially centralized through the `api.py` module, likely does not support such dynamic backend specification out-of-the-box.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n    To resolve the issue, the `open_dataset` implementation(s), especially the one in `api.py`, would need to be enhanced to:\n\n    - Support receiving a custom function or class object directly via the `engine` parameter.\n    - Bypass the existing engine lookup and validation mechanism when such an object is provided, directly invoking the supplied backend for dataset operations.\n    - Preserve existing functionality for string-specified engines.\n\nThis enhancement requires identifying where the current engine specification, lookup, and validation process occurs within `api.py` (or potentially within a centralized mechanism that spans across the backend-specific files) and introducing a new branch in the logic to handle function or class object-based engine specifications.\n\nGiven these considerations, the **bug locations** relevant for addressing the feature request are:\n\n- **Location 1**: File: `xarray/backends/api.py`, Method: `open_dataset`. This method should be modified to include a condition that checks if the `engine` parameter is a function or class object and, if so, directly uses it as the backend without going through the standard engine lookup process. This will effectively allow users to pass custom backend engines directly when opening a dataset."
