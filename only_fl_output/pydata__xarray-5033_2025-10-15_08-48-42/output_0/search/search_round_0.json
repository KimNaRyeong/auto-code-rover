Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I'll need to understand how `load_dataset` is currently handling the `engine` parameter and how backends are registered. Thus, I will focus on gathering context around these areas:\n\n1. Search for the `load_dataset` method, as this is where the `engine` parameter is used.\n2. Look into how external plugins or backends are registered, as mentioned relating to `setup.py` \u2014 this might not be directly searchable via code if it's a configuration-based approach, but anything akin to a backend registration or management within the codebase could be relevant.\n3. Investigate any existing mechanism within the code that checks or validates the `engine` parameter.\n\nTo achieve this, I'll make the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"load_dataset\")`: To find where the `load_dataset` method is defined and how it's currently implemented, especially regarding handling the `engine` parameter.\n2. `search_code(\"engine parameter\")`: This would help in finding where the `engine` parameter is specifically checked or utilized beyond just the `load_dataset` function, giving context on its current handling.\n3. `search_code(\"register backend\")`: To possibly uncover how backends are registered within the Python code, which could point us to the system managing backend plugins.\n4. `search_code(\"setup.py\")`: Even though we might not find `setup.py` manipulation within the codebase (since it's more about the package setup configuration), this search might reveal discussions or references that explain how external plugins are currently integrated.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `engine` parameters and external backends are managed in the project, which will be crucial for figuring out how to implement the requested feature."
