Based on the description in the issue, we will search for the classes or methods that handle validators, the ValidationError mechanism, and any instances where validators might be including error messages. We'll start by searching for the class that handles validators and any use of `ValidationError`.\n\n1. `search_code(\"ValidationError\")` - This will help us identify where `ValidationError` is being used across the project, which is likely where we'll need to include the provided value.\n2. `search_code(\"validators\")` - Since the issue discusses built-in validators, this search should help us find where these validators are defined or utilized.\n3. `search_method(\"validate_email\")` - Assuming there is a specific method for email validation as an example, this will provide insight into how a specific validator is implemented and how it raises a `ValidationError`.\n\nThese searches will give us a broader understanding of where and how validation errors are handled and where we might make modifications to include the provided value in the error messages."
