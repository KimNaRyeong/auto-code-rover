        "intended_behavior": "This file likely contains the core logic for built-in validators used across Django. To resolve the issue, validators in this file should be enhanced to support custom error messages that can include the provided value. The mechanism for raising a `ValidationError` should be adjusted or extended to interpolate the provided value into the error message. This might involve modifying how `ValidationError` is instantiated by each validator to accept and insert the provided value into the error message, possibly through a placeholder mechanism or formatting method. The existing functionality for validation should be preserved, with the enhancement that error messages can now dynamically include the provided value that failed validation."

        "intended_behavior": "For form fields, especially those handling user inputs like email, customization of the `ValidationError` messages to include the input values requires adjustments at the field level. Methods responsible for field-specific validation within this class should be reviewed to ensure they can support including the provided value in any raised error messages. This might mean adjusting how these methods construct `ValidationError` instances or how they define error messages. The goal is to enable the use of placeholders or dynamic strings that can include the provided value, thus making error messages more informative. This should be done in a way that maintains backward compatibility and doesn't break existing custom validators or error message customizations."
