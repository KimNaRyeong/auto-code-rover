        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context surrounding the use of `ValidationError` and `validators` in the project provides insight into how validation errors are thrown and handled, as well as where validators are defined and utilized within the Django framework. Since the `validate_email` method was not found, it indicates either an error in the method name provided in the search or that such functionality is buried within other validation mechanisms, perhaps as part of the validators set for fields or forms.\n\n### Analysis of `ValidationError` Usage\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `ValidationError` occurrences across various files such as `forms`, `models`, `admin`, `password_validation`, and others suggest that Django raises `ValidationError` exceptions in multiple contexts, including form validation, model field validation, and more specific contexts like password validation rules and geo IP checks.\n\n#### Relationship with the issue\nThe issue specifically wants to enhance these validators to include the provided value within the error messages, which implies that wherever `ValidationError` is raised, the code might need adjustments to support using a placeholder for the provided value. \n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior would involve modifying these implementations to ensure that when `ValidationError` is raised, it includes a way to interpolate the provided value within the error message. This might involve adjusting how error messages are defined (to include a placeholder for the provided value) and how `ValidationError` instances are instantiated (to pass the provided value).\n\n### Analysis of `validators` Usage\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe mentions of `validators` across files such as `forms/fields.py`, `db/models/fields`, and `core/validators.py` indicate that validators are extensively used in form fields, model field definitions, and as part of the core validation mechanism. This aligns with Django's mechanism for enforcing data integrity and business logic at various levels within an application.\n\n#### Relationship with the issue\nSince validators are central to the issue, understanding where and how they are defined and applied is crucial. The issue's resolution likely involves modifying these validators or the framework around them to support including the input value in error messages.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended modifications could involve enhancing the validators' interface to support error message customization, including the problematic value. This might mean adjusting both the definition of validators to allow for such flexibility and the points where validators are used to pass additional context (the input value) into the `ValidationError` mechanism.\n\n### Next Steps Based on the Analysis\n\nGiven the absence of a direct hit for the `validate_email` method, our next step should involve a closer examination of where email or general field validation occurs, particularly within `forms/fields.py` and `core/validators.py`, as these areas appear central to both the handling of `ValidationError` instances and the definition/application of validators.\n\n1. **Re-examine validators definition and usage**: Since the `validate_email` method was not found, explore closely related methods or validators used for email fields. This might involve searching for field-specific validation mechanisms employed for `EmailField` or equivalent fields.\n   \n   - `search_code(\"EmailField\")` to identify how email validation might be implemented or referenced.\n   \n2. **Examine core validator implementations**: Given the high number of `validators` mentions in `core/validators.py`, a deeper look into this file could provide insights into how validators are constructed and how they could be enhanced to include the provided value in error reports.\n\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"validator\", \"django/core/validators.py\")` to understand how validators are implemented and potentially identify a spot for enhancement.\n\nThese steps aim to identify the structural locations and mechanisms where the proposed enhancement can be integrated within the existing framework for raising and handling `ValidationError` with a more informative context."

To resolve the issue, validators in this file should be enhanced to support custom error messages that can include the provided value. The mechanism for raising a `ValidationError` should be adjusted or extended to interpolate the provided value into the error message. This might involve modifying how `ValidationError` is instantiated by each validator to accept and insert the provided value into the error message, possibly through a placeholder mechanism or formatting method. The existing functionality for validation should be preserved, with the enhancement that error messages can now dynamically include the provided value that failed validation.\n\n- **Location 2: File: django/forms/fields.py, Class: Field, Method: (various validation methods)**  \n    - **Intended Behavior**: For form fields, especially those handling user inputs like email, customization of the `ValidationError` messages to include the input values requires adjustments at the field level. Methods responsible for field-specific validation within this class should be reviewed to ensure they can support including the provided value in any raised error messages. This might mean adjusting how these methods construct `ValidationError` instances or how they define error messages. The goal is to enable the use of placeholders or dynamic strings that can include the provided value, thus making error messages more informative. This should be done in a way that maintains backward compatibility and doesn't break existing custom validators or error message customizations.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors align with the goal of making Django's error handling more informative and flexible, particularly in the context of displaying custom error messages that include user-provided values."
