To better align with the requirements and recreate the scenario considering Python 3's behavior, let's adjust the approach. However, it's important to note that the original issue seems related to Python 2, where Unicode handling could cause such errors. Python 3 fundamentally handles Unicode differently, making this specific issue (UnicodeEncodeError when dealing with Unicode assertion messages in tests) unlikely to appear. Nonetheless, here's how we might attempt to reproduce an issue in a Python 3 context, by trying to simulate a situation where handling Unicode incorrectly could potentially raise an error. Note, this adaptation aims at forcing a Unicode handling scenario that might cause a problem similar to what's expected; however, due to improvements in Python 3, reproducing the exact Python 2 error behavior may not be possible.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_unicode_assertion():
    try:
        # Simulate assertion with Unicode message
        assert False, "\u2603"
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Trying to simulate a handling that could cause UnicodeEncodeError in Python 2
        # In Python 3, this is not expected to fail, but we simulate stress on the system.
        try:
            message = str(e)
            print(f"AssertionError caught with message: {message}")
        except UnicodeEncodeError as unicode_error:
            print("UnicodeEncodeError caught: Demonstrates a potential issue.")
            print_stacktrace(unicode_error)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate reproduction of a similar issue
        else:
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 when no error or when issue is fixed/handled correctly

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_unicode_assertion()
```

In this version, the focus remains on catching the `AssertionError` and handling its message in a way that could potentially surface a Unicode encoding issue, particularly aiming at highlighting how Python 3's behavior differs substantially from Python 2's in terms of Unicode. Given Python 3's design, it's highly unlikely to encounter `UnicodeEncodeError` under normal assertion handling scenarios, so this script might not strictly reproduce the original issue but rather ensures correct handling of Unicode in assertion messages.
