        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather both high-level architectural information about how `xarray` integrates with parallel computation frameworks like `dask`, and more granular details about relevant classes, methods, or functions that facilitate this integration. Given the details in the issue, let's focus on several key areas:\n\n1. How `xarray` is currently wrapping `dask.array` objects. This will offer insights into potential refactoring.\n2. Inspection of the current mechanisms for parallel computation to understand how they can be extended or abstracted for other frameworks like `cubed`.\n3. The specific methods mentioned (`chunk`, `compute`, along with dask-like functions such as `blockwise`, `map_blocks`, and `rechunk`) to see how they're implemented or could be integrated with alternative frameworks.\n\nTherefore, the search queries could be targeted as follows:\n\n- Search for how `dask.array` objects are currently wrapped by `xarray` methods or classes. This might involve looking into specific classes or methods within `xarray` that deal with parallel execution.\n- Inspection of the specific methods or functions mentioned (`chunk`, `compute`, `blockwise`, `map_blocks`, `rechunk`) in the `xarray` codebase to understand their current implementation and reliance on `dask`.\n\nBased on the specifics mentioned in the issue, let's draft our API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")`: To start with, as `dask.array` objects are likely manipulated via `xarray`'s `DataArray` or similar high-level classes.\n2. `search_class(\"Dataset\")`: Since `Dataset` is another core structure in `xarray` that could be involved in wrapping and managing parallel computation frameworks.\n3. `search_method(\"chunk\")`: To find how chunking is implemented which is central to parallel computation.\n4. `search_method(\"compute\")`: This will provide us with information on how `compute` operations are currently abstracted.\n5. `search_code(\"dask.array\")`: To find explicit mentions of `dask.array` which could show us the points of current integration.\n6. `search_method(\"blockwise\")`: Though this might be more related to 'dask' or 'cubed', seeing if 'xarray' has any existing adaptation will be useful.\n7. `search_method(\"map_blocks\")`: Similar reason as above; to check for current usages or placeholders for such dask-like operations.\n8. `search_method(\"rechunk\")`: Given `rechunk` is mentioned as a dask-like function present in `cubed`, this could provide insights into flexibility for adding other frameworks.\n   \nThese calls will provide a broad view across different points of integration, current mechanism's adaptability, and areas requiring refactor for a more pluggable architecture concerning parallel processing frameworks integration within `xarray`."
