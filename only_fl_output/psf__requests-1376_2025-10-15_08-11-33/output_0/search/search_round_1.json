The error occurs during an assertion in a unit test which checks that the multipart form data is correctly formatted and does not mistakenly include the `b` prefix that indicates a byte string in Python.\n\nSince we couldn't directly access `test_requests.py`, we can:\n\n1. Try finding where `RequestsTestCase` is defined in the entire codebase. There's a chance `test_requests.py` was moved, renamed, or the issue description contains a typo.\n2. Search for the `httpbin` function, as it's likely a utility function used across various tests and might give us a clue as to where the tests related to the `requests` library are located.\n3. Look for the method `prepare` of the `Request` class within the `requests` library since the `prepare` method is a crucial part of requests where the error seems to be manifesting.\n4. Lastly, find references to `.encode('utf-8')` within the contexts of tests or request object creation, to possibly zero in on similar usage patterns or the code path that leads to the assertion error.\n\nLet's proceed with these alternative API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"RequestsTestCase\")`\n- `search_method(\"httpbin\")`\n- `search_method(\"prepare\")`\n- `search_code(\".encode('utf-8')\")`"
