Here's the plan:\n\n1. Identify the class where the issue is happening by looking at the stack trace provided in the issue description. It mentions `<test_requests.RequestsTestCase testMethod=test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames>`, suggesting that the issue resides within a test case of `RequestsTestCase`.\n\n2. Given that we know the test method name and have an indication of the file from the stack trace (`test_requests.py`), we will:\n   - Search for the class definition of `RequestsTestCase` in the file `test_requests.py` to get an overview of the class structure and other possibly related test cases or setup methods that could influence the behavior of the failing test.\n   - Search for the specific method `test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames` within `test_requests.py` to get the method definition and its immediate context.\n   - Look at the code around the line where the AssertionError occurs to understand the immediate context of the failing assertion.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"RequestsTestCase\", \"test_requests.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames\", \"test_requests.py\")`\n- `get_code_around_line(\"test_requests.py\", 356, 5)`"
