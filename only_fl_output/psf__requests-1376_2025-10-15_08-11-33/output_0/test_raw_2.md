Here's a standalone Python script tailored to reproduce the specified issue within a testing scenario. This script is explicitly designed to provoke an `AssertionError` if the problem as described persists and to utilize the provided `print_stacktrace` function for error reporting. Please ensure that this script is stored in the root directory of your project and that you have the `requests` library available in your environment. If `requests` is not installed, you can do so by running `pip install requests`.

```python
import requests

def httpbin(suffix):
    return f'https://httpbin.org/{suffix}'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to mirror the scenario that leads to the failure
    try:
        r = requests.Request(method='POST',
                             url=httpbin('post'),
                             data={'stuff'.encode('utf-8'): 'elixr'},  # Mimics the issue's setup
                             files={'file': ('reproducer.py', open(__file__, 'rb'))})  # References itself as the file content
        prep = r.prepare()

        # Executing assertions equivalent to those in the provided test case
        assert b'name="stuff"' in prep.body, "Assertion failed: b'name=\"stuff\"' not found in request body"
        if b'name="b\'stuff\'"' in prep.body:
            raise AssertionError("Assertion failed: Found unwanted b'name=\"b\\'stuff\\'\"' in request body")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensures a non-zero exit code in case of failure, as per common convention in error scenarios
    else:
        print("Issue not reproduced, test passed!")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script endeavors to recreate the environment and conditions under which the original issue was observed. Upon executing it with `python3 reproducer.py`, it will attempt to trigger the `AssertionError`. If the `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the issue's presence, the script will provide a detailed stack trace reflecting the error's context. Conversely, if the problem has been resolved and the test passes, the script will cleanly exit with code 0, signaling success.
