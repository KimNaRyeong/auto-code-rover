Certainly! Below is the corrected Python script that follows your instructions. It includes the necessary imports and error handling. Notice that I've included the array import from `numpy` to ensure the example is fully executable.

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_min_max_axis():
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis

    X = sp.csc_matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
    X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

    Y = sp.csr_matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
    Y.indptr = Y.indptr.astype('int64')

    expected_y = (np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int32), np.array([3, 4], dtype=np.int32))
    expected_x = (np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int32), np.array([3, 4], dtype=np.int32))

    try:
        min_max_y = min_max_axis(Y, 0)
        assert np.array_equal(min_max_y[0], expected_y[0]) and np.array_equal(min_max_y[1], expected_y[1]), "Mismatch in CSR matrix min and max values."

        min_max_x = min_max_axis(X, 0)
        assert np.array_equal(min_max_x[0], expected_x[0]) and np.array_equal(min_max_x[1], expected_x[1]), "Mismatch in CSC matrix min and max values."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected: TypeError when input is large csc matrix on 32 bit Windows.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_min_max_axis()
```

This script includes proper handling for comparing numpy arrays, which was missing from the initial attempt, and correct error handling practices to ensure that any exceptions caught during the execution are properly communicated back to the user. The `print_stacktrace` function will help in pinpointing exactly where and why the error occurred if the issue is still present. This script should be saved as `reproducer.py` and run with Python 3.x. It's designed to trigger an `AssertionError` if the original issue is encountered, thus confirming the presence of the described bug or exit cleanly with code 0 if the issue has been addressed.
