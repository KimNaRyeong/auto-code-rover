        "intended_behavior": "The `_g_sig_digits` function needs to safely handle cases where the `delta` is zero or negative, which can cause a math domain error when computing the logarithm. The function should ensure that the `delta` used in the logarithm operation is always positive and greater than zero. This could be achieved by adding a check or safeguard to return a default value of significant digits if the `delta` is non-positive. This change will preserve the functionality of calculating significant digits for data values while preventing domain errors for uniform or negative-only datasets."

        "method": "format_cursor_data",
        "intended_behavior": "While `format_cursor_data` correctly handles formatting for a variety of data types, including scalar mappable data, it indirectly contributes to the bug through its use of `_g_sig_digits` for calculating the number of significant digits. Since the direct cause relates more to how `_g_sig_digits` handles its input values, changes to `format_cursor_data` should be minimal, focused on ensuring any inputs to `_g_sig_digits` are validated or pre-processed to avoid domain errors. However, given `_g_sig_digits` is the primary fault point, adjustments here might only be necessary if additional context reveals this method as a direct contributor to error handling."
