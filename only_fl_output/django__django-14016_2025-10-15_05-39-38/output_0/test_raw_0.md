This script tries to reproduce the specific issue mentioned with `Q` objects in Django when using a non-picklable type with the `|` operator. The script includes the `print_stacktrace` function as required, which will clearly display where in the code the exception was raised if the issue exists.

Make sure your Django environment is set up correctly before running this script by having Django installed and configured. This means you should have a project with a configured database or use Django in a way that doesn't require a database connection for this specific test.
