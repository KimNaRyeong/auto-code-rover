Here are the API calls that will help us achieve this:\n\n1. Search for the `DateFormat` class to find which file it's defined in.\n2. Once we have the file path, search for the `Y` method within that file to understand its implementation.\n3. If step 2 does not directly reveal the implementation, we may need to search across the entire codebase for the `Y` method in case it's dynamically defined or handled in an unconventional way within the class.\n\nSo, the first step is to find out where `DateFormat` is defined:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"DateFormat\")\n```"
