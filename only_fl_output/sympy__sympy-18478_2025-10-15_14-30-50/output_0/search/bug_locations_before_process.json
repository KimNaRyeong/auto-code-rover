        "intended_behavior": "The `subs` method should accurately apply mathematical principles when substituting symbols with infinity. Specifically, it should recognize that while expressions like `x` or `exp(x)` appropriately tend towards positive infinity, oscillatory functions like `cos(x)` do not converge to a single value and thus should not be simplified to a boundary without extensive mathematical justification. Enhancements might include refined logic for identifying and appropriately handling cases of substitution with infinity, particularly for functions known to approach limits in distinct manners."
