To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue described, we have several assumptions and limitations to take into account:

1. Sphinx must be properly installed alongside its dependencies (including `docutils` as the error indicates it was missing).
2. The script attempts to use Python 3 syntax and compatibility (the original issue was reported for Python 2.7.3).
3. The script should create a minimal Sphinx project to exactly mimic the described behavior, generate the documentation, and then check the build folder for duplicate files.

Taking these into consideration, the provided standalone script below should work if all dependencies are installed correctly. This script tries to replicate the issue, but please note, behavior might differ based on the Sphinx and Python versions due to changes in the way paths and duplicates are handled.

```python
import os
import sys
import shutil
from sphinx.cmd.build import build_main
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project(source_dir, build_dir):
    os.makedirs(f"{source_dir}/document/downloads", exist_ok=True)
    (Path(source_dir) / "conf.py").write_text("project = 'TestProject'\n")
    (Path(source_dir) / "document/index.rst").write_text(
        ":download:`downloads/archive.zip`\n"
        ":download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`\n"
        ":download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`\n"
    )
    with open(f"{source_dir}/document/downloads/archive.zip", "wb") as f:
        f.write(b"Dummy zip content.")

try:
    source_dir = "test_source"
    build_dir = "test_build"
    
    setup_sphinx_project(source_dir, build_dir)

    # Build the Sphinx project
    build_main([source_dir, build_dir])
    
    # Check for duplicates
    downloads_dir = Path(build_dir) / "_downloads"
    archives = list(downloads_dir.glob("archive*.zip"))
    duplicates = [archive for archive in archives if archive.stem != "archive"]

    if duplicates:
        raise AssertionError("Duplicate archive files detected.")
    
    print("Test passed, no duplicates found.")
    sys.exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

finally:
    shutil.rmtree(source_dir, ignore_errors=True)
    shutil.rmtree(build_dir, ignore_errors=True)
```

This script simulates the scenario described in the issue report:
- It sets up a minimal Sphinx project structure with one RST file containing links to the same ZIP file in three different path forms.
- It builds the documentation.
- It checks the build output for duplicate ZIP files.

Please ensure Sphinx and all dependencies (including `docutils`) are correctly installed in your Python environment before running this script. Adjustments may be needed depending on the Sphinx version and project specifics.
