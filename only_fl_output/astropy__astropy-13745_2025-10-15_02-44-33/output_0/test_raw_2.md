Apologies for any confusion caused earlier. Here's a correctly formatted `reproducer.py` script incorporating the provided function for printing a stack trace. This script is designed to reproduce the issue described - the rejection of `float32` representation of π/2 by `Latitude`. 

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latitude_with_float32():
    from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
    import numpy as np
    try:
        lat = np.float32(np.pi / 2)
        Latitude(lat, 'rad')
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If we catch a ValueError, it confirms the issue is present
        raise AssertionError("Latitude(float32) should not raise an error") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_latitude_with_float32()
```

This script will execute the problematic code. If the issue exists, it will catch a `ValueError` when attempting to create a `Latitude` object with a `float32` representation of π/2, and then it will call the `print_stacktrace` function to print the stack trace. Afterwards, it escalates the issue by raising an `AssertionError`. This behavior aligns with the instructions provided to indicate that the problem is present. The script should terminate with exit code 0 only if the issue has been addressed and no exception is raised by the `Latitude` constructor when executing this script.
