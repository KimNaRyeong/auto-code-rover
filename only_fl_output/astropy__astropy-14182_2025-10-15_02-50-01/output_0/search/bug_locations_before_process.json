        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `__init__` method of the `RST` class to accept a `header_rows` argument. This argument should be optional and handled in such a way that existing functionality is not impacted if it's not provided. Enhance the `write` method(or relevant method within the class that generates the output) to check for the presence of `header_rows`. If present, these should be properly formatted and included in the output before the data rows. This implies that the output generation logic needs to be adaptive based on the presence of header rows, inserting them as additional rows at the beginning of the output table, formatted according to the rst standard. Ensure that this modification does not affect other writer classes or the overall functionality of the `write` method for scenarios where `header_rows` is not used, ensuring backward compatibility."
