It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue at hand, we need to gather more context about where and how `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are used within the LaTeX printing routines of the project. We will target three main objectives:\n\n1. **Identify where these commands are used**: Since we know the commands, we can search for the code snippets directly to see in which files and contexts they are utilized.\n2. **Determine the current mechanism for printing text in LaTeX routines**: If there's an existing centralized mechanism or several scattered implementations for printing text in LaTeX format.\n3. **Explore the possibility of adding a helper function**: We need to understand the current structure to integrate a new helper function seamlessly.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n1. `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\mathrm\")`: This will help us identify all occurrences of `\\mathrm` in the codebase to see how and where it's used.\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\text\")`: Similarly, this will locate all instances of `\\text` to compare and contrast its usage against `\\mathrm`.\n3. `search_method(method_name: \"print_text\")`: Although it seems there isn't a `print_text` method yet, this call will verify if any similar naming convention exists, possibly avoiding conflicts or redundancy.\n4. `search_code(code_str: \"amsmath\")`: This will help to see if the `amsmath` package is widely used or mentioned, which could influence the decision on standardization."
