It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### Usage of `\\mathrm` and `\\text`\nThe search results for `\\mathrm` and `\\text` provide us with specific insights into how they are currently being used within the Sympy library's LaTeX printing routines.\n\n1. **`\\mathrm` Usage Context**\n   - Found in `sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py` within classes `_erfs` and `_eis`, where `\\mathrm` is used in the documentation string to keep mathematical entities readable and consistent for a particular algorithm (`Gruntz algorithm`). This suggests that `\\mathrm` is employed for proper LaTeX rendering in special function handlers.\n\n2. **`\\text` Usage Context**\n   - Located in `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`, indicating `\\text` is used within documentation to generate LaTeX formatted strings, specifically for conditions and generated symbols in integration documentation. This infers `\\text` is preferred for adapting text rendering according to the math environment's font settings in documentation.\n\n#### Relationship to the Issue\n- The issue directly relates to standardizing the use of `\\mathrm` and `\\text` across LaTeX printing routines, noting that `\\mathrm` doesn't adapt to the current math font which `\\text` can, yet `\\text` requires the `amsmath` package. Our findings show `\\mathrm` being used in special function handling, primarily for maintaining notation consistency, and `\\text` in integration documentation, leveraging its font adaptation ability.\n- The current usage patterns suggest a mixed approach, optimized for the local context (notation consistency vs. font adaptation).\n\n#### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue\nGiven the issue description, the code snippets employing `\\mathrm` and `\\text` should ideally adapt based on a configurable setting allowing users to choose between font consistency (`\\mathrm`) and font adaptability (`\\text`). This integrated flexibility would necessitate adapting these and possibly other sections of the code to respect a global or scoped configuration setting.\n\n### Further Context Needed\nTo form a complete resolution strategy, additional context around configuration handling in SymPy and whether an infrastructure exists for such LaTeX-specific configurations would be beneficial. Additionally, understanding the structure and usage of `amsmath` within the project could help gauge the feasibility and impact of making `\\text` the standard option.\n\n#### Next Steps for Additional Context\n1. **Configuration Mechanism Inquiry**\n   - To understand how or if LaTeX printing configurations are handled, we need to explore if there's an existing configuration class or method that deals with rendering preferences.\n   - API Calls:\n     - `search_class(\"Config\")`\n     - `search_method(\"get_config\")`\n\n2. **`amsmath` Package Utilization Depth**\n   - Given its dependency for `\\text`, understanding how extensively `amsmath` is integrated and mentioned across the project can provide insights into the potential impact of standardizing on `\\text`.\n    - Suggested manual review of files returned by `search_code(\"amsmath\")` to find out how `amsmath` is configured or invoked. This would guide the decision towards making `\\text` the standard and assessing the impact on users not already using `amsmath`."

Here are the locations and suggestions for intended behavior:\n\n#### Location 1:\n- **File:** `sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py`\n- **Class:** `_erfs` and `_eis`\n- **Intended Behavior:** These classes utilize `\\mathrm` directly in their docstrings for LaTeX representation. A configurable printing method should be introduced to allow switching between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` based on user preference or a configuration setting. This would maintain the existing functionality (providing a readable LaTeX representation) while allowing flexibility in font adaptation.\n\n#### Location 2:\n- **File:** `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** Currently, this file uses `\\text` for LaTeX formatting in strings related to documentation. The intended behavior here would introduce the same flexibility as in special error functions, allowing the output to adapt based on a global/project-wide setting for text representation in LaTeX. This ensures documentation generated adapts to user preferences regarding LaTeX package dependencies and font consistency.\n\n### Intended Enhancement to Resolve the Issue:\n\n- **Addition:** To centrally manage the choice between `\\mathrm` and `\\text`, introduce a new helper function (suggested to be named `print_text` or similar) within a relevant module that handles LaTeX printing routines. This function would check the current configuration setting and output the text with the appropriate LaTeX command wrapped around it.\n\n  - **Potential Location for the New Method:** \n    - **File:** Likely within `sympy/printing/latex.py` or a similar file that centrally handles LaTeX printing routines.\n    - **Class/Module:** A class or module that is either specifically for configurations or globally accessible for LaTeX printing.\n  \n  - **Intended Behavior of the New Method:** The method should take a string of text as input and return it wrapped in either `\\mathrm{}` or `\\text{}` based on a global user-configurable setting. This solution would preserve existing functionality by defaulting to the current standard (likely `\\mathrm` for compatibility) but allow users who prefer or require `\\text` (and have the necessary LaTeX packages) to easily switch.\n\nConsidering the issue revolves around configuration and standardization rather than correcting a malfunction, our \"bug locations\" represent points of enhancement rather than traditional bugs."
