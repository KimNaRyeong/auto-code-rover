Given the specific requirements and the goal to reproduce the noted issue elegantly in a `reproducer.py` file, below is a crafted python script designed for execution in the root directory of a project like scikit-learn. This script will attempt to replicate the error associated with `_BaseComposition._set_params` method when there are no estimators. In the presence of the described issue, it will raise an `AssertionError` while providing a clear stack trace of the underlying problem. If the issue has been resolved, it exits gracefully with code 0.

Here's how the python script will look:

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # Attempts to invoke set_params on a ColumnTransformer with no transformers
        # This is the core operation to validate for the discussed issue reproduction
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If no ValueError is raised, we assume the issue has been resolved
        print("No issue detected: Issue appears to be resolved.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        if "not enough values to unpack" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Detected the issue as described.")
        else:
            # This branch helps identify other ValueErrors unrelated to the specific issue
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Encountered a different ValueError than expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catches all other exceptions which are not ValueError
        # This is crucial for diagnosing unexpected errors while attempting the reproduction
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Encountered an unexpected error type.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        # Stripping the code_context for clarity and conciseness
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown code context"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}", line {line_number}', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Printing the exception type and message for clear identification of the issue
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use this script:

1. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project.
2. Ensure your environment has the correct version of scikit-learn installed along with all required dependencies.
3. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py` command.

This script serves as a clear and concise tool for replicating the specific problem, aiding developers in validating the presence of the issue and facilitating efforts towards its resolution.
