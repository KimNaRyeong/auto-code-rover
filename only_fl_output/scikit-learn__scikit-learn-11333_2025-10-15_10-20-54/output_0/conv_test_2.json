In the presence of the described issue, it will raise an `AssertionError` while providing a clear stack trace of the underlying problem. If the issue has been resolved, it exits gracefully with code 0.\n\nHere's how the python script will look:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef main():\n    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n    try:\n        # Attempts to invoke set_params on a ColumnTransformer with no transformers\n        # This is the core operation to validate for the discussed issue reproduction\n        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)\n        # If no ValueError is raised, we assume the issue has been resolved\n        print(\"No issue detected: Issue appears to be resolved.\")\n        exit(0)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        if \"not enough values to unpack\" in str(e):\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            raise AssertionError(\"Detected the issue as described.\")\n        else:\n            # This branch helps identify other ValueErrors unrelated to the specific issue\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            raise AssertionError(\"Encountered a different ValueError than expected.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Catches all other exceptions which are not ValueError\n        # This is crucial for diagnosing unexpected errors while attempting the reproduction\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"Encountered an unexpected error type.\")\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        # Stripping the code_context for clarity and conciseness\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown code context\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\", line {line_number}', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    # Printing the exception type and message for clear identification of the issue\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1.
