Search for the `cse` method in the codebase to understand its implementation and any related documentation that could suggest why the behavior described in the issue arises.\n2. Search for the `MatrixSymbol` class to understand its structure and functionalities, since the issue seems to interact closely with how `MatrixSymbol` instances are processed by `cse`.\n3. Search for the `subs` method since it is directly used for substituting symbols within expressions, and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol` might be relevant to the problem.\n4. Search for any code that specifically handles the indexing of `MatrixSymbol` instances, as the issue seems to originate from or relate to how these instances are indexed or used within expressions.\n\nTherefore, the API calls will be:\n\n- `search_method(\"cse\")`: To understand the `cse` method's logic and documentation.\n- `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: To understand the implementation and usage of `MatrixSymbol`.\n- `search_method(\"subs\")`: To check the documentation or implementation details of the `subs` method, which might hint at issues when used with `MatrixSymbol`.\n- `search_code(\"matrix[i, j]\")`: To find code snippets that handle the indexing of matrices or `MatrixSymbol` instances, which might reveal patterns or known issues related to the problem described."
