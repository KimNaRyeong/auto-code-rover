It will be colored based on xtick.color / ytick.color.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams.update({'ytick.labelcolor': 'red'})\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot([1.01e9,1.02e9,1.03e9])\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![wrong_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083612-dddf85ba-ebfa-4bf0-8ae0-3dce36c17198.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![correct_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083512-34b3b32f-5d3a-4242-8742-2269bb09c20c.png)\n### Additional information\nThe following patch seems to fix it for my simple usecases:\n```\ndiff --git a/axis.py b/axis.py\n--- a/axis.py\n+++ b/axis.py\t(date 1675716341305)\n@@ -2203,7 +2203,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'bottom'\n@@ -2456,7 +2456,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'left'\n```\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.3\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\nNone\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we should focus our search on the implementation of how tick labels, including the exponent label, are colored and rendered in Matplotlib. The provided patch modifies behavior in what appears to be an `axis.py` file, suggesting that the relevant code changes might be located within classes or methods responsible for axis rendering, particularly those handling offset text and tick properties.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be highly relevant to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. To understand how the exponent label (offset text) is initially set up and its color attribute is determined, we should look into the file and search for classes or methods mentioned in the patch:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Axis\", \"axis.py\")` - This would help us identify the `Axis` class within `axis.py`, where the tick and label properties are likely managed.\n\n2. The specific method responsible for handling the offset text setup based on the patch provided:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"set_offset_position\", \"axis.py\")` - This call is based on the assumption that setting the position might involve setting properties such as color. If \"set_offset_position\" doesn't directly match, it will be necessary to adjust based on actual method names related to offset text found in the class definition from the first call.\n  \n3. To correctly apply the provided patch and understand its impact, looking at the code surrounding the changes will be helpful:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']\", \"axis.py\")` - To find where the xtick color is set for the offset text, informing us of the existing pattern before applying the patch.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color']\", \"axis.py\")` - Similarly, to identify where the ytick color is assigned for the offset text, which will be modified according to the patch.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how axis tick labels and their colors are handled, specifically in relation to the offset text (exponent label) in the `axis.py` file for Matplotlib. This will allow us to better understand the existing implementation and how the proposed patch affects it."
