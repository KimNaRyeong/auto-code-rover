Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\nThis is because FileResponse is not async compatible (nor is that likely, since neither is open()).\nA new project with:\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\"daphne\",\n...\n]\nASGI_APPLICATION = \"project.asgi.application\"\nrunserver, and then visit any page serving static files such as /admin/.\nThe fix is to have ASGIStaticFilesHandler adapt the iterator in the same way StreamingHttpResponse does.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation and usage of `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, `StreamingHttpResponse`, and potentially `FileResponse`, as these are directly mentioned in the issue. Additionally, understanding how `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` handles iterators could be crucial for devising a solution. Here are the API calls that would help gather this information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: This will help us find where `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is defined in the codebase.\n\n2. `search_class(\"StreamingHttpResponse\")`: Since the warning originates from `StreamingHttpResponse` being unable to consume synchronous iterators properly in an ASGI environment, understanding its current implementation is critical.\n\n3. `search_method(\"StreamingHttpResponse\", \"http.response.py\")`: Given the warning's specific reference to a line in `http/response.py`, this will help identify the method raising the warning and any specific checks or handling for iterator types.\n\n4. `search_code(\"FileResponse is not async compatible\")`: While it's a comment mentioned in the issue, searching this could lead us to discussions or code comments in the codebase where `FileResponse`'s incompatibility with async operations is addressed or noted, providing further context.\n\n5. `search_method_in_class(\"__iter__\", \"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: Since the issue revolves around the handling of iterators in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, specifically searching for how it implements or overrides the `__iter__` method could offer insights into potential places for adaptation.\n\n6. `search_method_in_class(\"__aiter__\", \"StreamingHttpResponse\")`: Understanding if `StreamingHttpResponse` has an asynchronous iterator implementation (`__aiter__`) will be necessary for ensuring the proposed fix aligns with existing asynchronous support within Django 4.2. \n\nThese API calls aim to collect context regarding the issue's components, their current implementations, and how they interact within an ASGI application, especially in relation to handling file responses and iterators."
