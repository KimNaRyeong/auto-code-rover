Search for any methods directly related to `RootOf` handling, such as solving or substituting expressions, to see how generators are managed.\n3. Search for the method where the generator for a polynomial is retrieved or set (`gen` attribute usage) to examine its behavior further.\n\nHere are the specific API calls to execute:\n\n- `search_class(\"RootOf\")`\n- `search_method(\"subs\")`\n- `search_method(\"gen\")`"
