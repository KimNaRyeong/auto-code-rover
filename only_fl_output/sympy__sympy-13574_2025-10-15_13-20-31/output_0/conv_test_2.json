Consider the following examples:\r\n\r\n' ' ' \r\nIn [1]: import sympy\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from sympy.matrices import randMatrix\r\n\r\nIn [3]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=1)\r\nOut[3]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[13, 61, 13],\r\n[59, 29, 59],\r\n[88, 13, 61]])\r\n\r\nIn [4]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=50)\r\nOut[4]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[90, 60,  0],\r\n[ 0,  0,  0],\r\n[60, 59, 25]])\r\n\r\nIn [7]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=99)\r\nOut[7]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[0, 0, 19],\r\n[0, 0,  0],\r\n[0, 0,  0]])\r\n\r\nIn [9]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=0)\r\nOut[9]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[78, 78, 61],\r\n[68,  8, 61],\r\n[22, 68,  8]])\r\n' ' ' \r\n\r\nAlso, the documentation says `If percent is less than 100 then only approximately the given percentage of elements will be non-zero.`, but the behaviour is the opposite.

The goal now is to carefully construct a script that explicitly checks for symmetry and reports precisely when it fails to achieve that.\n\nGiven the updated requirements, let's include more detailed checks for symmetry and adjust the script accordingly, clarifying the output messages and ensuring any exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef is_symmetric(matrix):\n    return matrix == matrix.T\n\ndef test_randMatrix_symmetric_sparse_matrices():\n    from sympy.matrices import randMatrix\n    try:\n        test_pass = True\n        for percent in [1, 50, 99, 0]:\n            matrix = randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=percent)\n            if not is_symmetric(matrix):\n                test_pass = False\n                print(f\"Matrix not symmetric at percent={percent}:\")\n                print(matrix)\n                break  # Break on the first failure\n        assert test_pass, \"Some matrices were not symmetric as expected.\"\n\n        if test_pass:\n            print(\"All matrices are symmetric as expected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_randMatrix_symmetric_sparse_matrices()\n```\n\nThis script introduces a loop to test various `percent` values more systematically, checking if the generated matrix is symmetric at each step. The `is_symmetric` function is a more explicit and direct approach to checking the matrices. If any matrix fails this symmetry check, the script reports the specific `percent` value that caused the issue. This should ensure that the script can correctly identify any failures to generate symmetric matrices according to the specified `percent` parameter value."
