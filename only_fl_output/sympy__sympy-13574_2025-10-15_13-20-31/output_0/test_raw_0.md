This script will test the symmetry of matrices generated by `randMatrix` with different `percent` values. If the matrices are not symmetric, the script will print a stack trace pointing to the exact assertion that failed. This helps in identifying at which `percent` value the function `randMatrix` starts deviating from the expected behavior of producing symmetric sparse matrices. When the issue is not present (i.e., all generated matrices are symmetric as expected), the script will complete without errors and print a confirmation message.
