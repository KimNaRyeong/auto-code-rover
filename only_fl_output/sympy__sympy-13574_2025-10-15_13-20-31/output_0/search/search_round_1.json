The optional `seed` or `prng` parameters can be used to control the randomness for reproducibility.\n\nFor symmetric matrices, after initially filling the upper triangle (including diagonal) with random numbers, it mirrors these values across the diagonal to ensure symmetry.\n\nWhen `percent` is less than 100, the function seems to compute the number of elements that should remain non-zero and sets the rest to zero, then shuffles the matrix elements.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug relates to the manner in which the `percent` parameter influences the generation of symmetric matrices. Ideally, setting `percent` to values other than 100 should uniformly distribute zeroes across the matrix while maintaining symmetry. However, based on the issue description, the method fails to maintain symmetry for values of `percent` less than 100, suggesting a flaw in how the non-zero elements are distributed or how symmetry is preserved post-application of this parameter.\n\nThe bug might be tied to the operations performed after calculating the `z` value (the count of elements to set as zero) and the subsequent steps to shuffle the matrix's internal representation, potentially disrupting the symmetry established earlier.\n\n### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior for the `randMatrix` function when generating symmetric matrices with a `percent` less than 100 should be:\n\n1. **Maintain Symmetry:** Even after introducing zeroes to reduce the density of non-zero elements, the resulting matrix should remain symmetric. This means if an element at `(i, j)` is set to zero/non-zero, the corresponding symmetric element at `(j, i)` should also be zero/non-zero, preserving the matrix's symmetry.\n\n2. **Approximate Percentage of Non-Zero Elements:** The number of non-zero elements should be approximately the specified `percent` of the total number of elements in the matrix. This involves handling the distribution of zeros in a way that affects both halves of the matrix (above and below the diagonal) uniformly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the problem possibly lies in the implementation details of how non-zero (and consequently zero) elements are distributed while shuffling `m._mat`, especially regarding maintaining symmetric elements' integrity post-shuffling. It suggests a need to refine the logic post the computation of `z` to ensure both the density constraint (`percent`) and symmetry are honored correctly."

Bug Location: \n   - File: sympy/matrices/dense.py\n   - Class: N/A\n   - Method: randMatrix\n\nIntended Behavior at Bug Location:\nTo resolve the issue, the `randMatrix` function should ensure that when generating a symmetric matrix with a `percent` parameter less than 100, it maintains symmetry even after reducing the density of non-zero elements. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic that sets elements to zero and shuffles the matrix to consider the matrix's symmetry. Specifically, for a symmetric matrix, instead of applying shuffling to the entire 1D representation of the matrix (`m._mat`), the algorithm should:\n\n- Identify positions (i, j) for non-zero elements in a way that respects the `percent` parameter and ensures that if `(i, j)` is chosen to be non-zero, then `(j, i)` is also chosen to be non-zero, thereby maintaining symmetry.\n- Fill the identified positions with random numbers as currently being done, and the rest should be set to zero.\n- Avoid blind shuffling that can disrupt the symmetry established. If any shuffling is needed, it should be done in a way that pairs of symmetric positions are moved together, ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.\n\nThis modification preserves the existing functionality of generating random matrices with specific characteristics (density of non-zero elements, symmetric property) while fixing the reported issue with the symmetry of sparse (percent < 100) matrices."
