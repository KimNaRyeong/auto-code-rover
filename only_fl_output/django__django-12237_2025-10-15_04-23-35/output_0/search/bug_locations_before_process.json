        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `slugify` method should be enhanced to handle the special case of the Turkish/Azerbaijani \"\u0130\" character such that it is converted to a lowercase \"i\" without generating a \"COMBINING DOT ABOVE\" character when `allow_unicode=True` is specified. This might involve adding a pre-processing step specifically for this character and potentially other Unicode characters that behave similarly. The objective is to ensure that all characters are transformed into a format that will be considered valid by the `SlugField` validator, which expects slugs to comprise only Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. This alteration must preserve the existing functionality for all other characters and scenarios, only adjusting the handling for specific problematic Unicode characters to prevent the ValidationError."
