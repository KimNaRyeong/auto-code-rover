Let's revise the `reproducer.py` script based on the feedback. The previous attempt resulted in executing the script with a `NameError` for `SympifyError` not being handled correctly. I'll adjust the script to import `SympifyError` correctly and ensure it does not result in an incorrect exit due to the unhandled exception.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_sympify_greek_alpha():
    from sympy import sympify, Symbol
    from sympy.core.sympify import SympifyError
    try:
        result = sympify("α")
        # Assuming that if the issue is present, an exception will be raised.
        # If sympify("α") succeeds without exception but gives unexpected output,
        # you should check the output against the expected Symbol representation.
        print("Success: No issue with sympify('α').")
    except SympifyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("SympifyError encountered") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympy_sympify_greek_alpha()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        # Exiting with 0 to signify the issue is reproduced successfully.
        exit(0) 
    except Exception as e:
        # For any unexpected exceptions, handle them accordingly.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate an unexpected failure.
        exit(1)
```

This script aims to reproduce the issue with `sympify("α")`. If the function `sympify` throws a `SympifyError` when attempting to parse the Greek character alpha ("α"), it confirms the issue is present. The script captures and prints a detailed stack trace of the error, providing insights into where and how the failure occurs. If an `AssertionError` is raised due to the presence of the `SympifyError`, we exit with code 0 to indicate that the issue has been successfully reproduced. Any other exceptions are handled separately, providing a stack trace for diagnostic purposes and exiting with a non-zero code to signify an unexpected error occurred.
