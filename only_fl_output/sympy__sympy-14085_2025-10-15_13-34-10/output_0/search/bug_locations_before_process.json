        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `sympify` method should be enhanced to explicitly recognize and convert Unicode Greek letters (e.g., \"\u03b1\") to their symbolic name equivalents within SymPy (e.g., `Symbol('alpha')`). The method already handles conversions of various types into SymPy recognized objects. However, for Greek letters like \"\u03b1\", there needs to be an addition or enhancement in the logic where it identifies these characters and maps them to their corresponding symbolic representations. This might involve extending the existing conversion or parsing mechanism to include a step specifically for handling Unicode Greek letters. This addition should preserve the general functionality of transforming different data types and expressions into SymPy-compatible symbolic objects without disrupting other conversion processes."

        "intended_behavior": "If the issue arises from how expressions are parsed (which could not be directly verified from the API call responses but is suggested by the use of `parse_expr` in `sympify`), then `parse_expr` may require adjustments to properly interpret and convert Unicode Greek symbols into their appropriate SymPy symbolic expressions. Although we couldn't directly inspect `parse_expr` due to the limitations in provided search results, an improvement here would involve ensuring that the parsing process includes steps for recognizing Unicode representations of Greek letters, treating them equivalently to their English symbolic names. This enhancement would enable `parse_expr` to operate correctly on strings containing such characters, expanding its ability to parse and convert a wider range of symbolic expressions into SymPy's format."
