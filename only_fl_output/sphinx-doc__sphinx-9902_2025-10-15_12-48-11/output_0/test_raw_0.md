To create a `reproducer.py` script for the context as given, we need to simulate an environment where Sphinx is invoked to generate documentation which includes a module level attribute with the `py:data` directive using `:type:` option. Since actually running Sphinx and parsing its output to validate link generation goes beyond the simplicity of a script like this, we'll instead focus on mimicking the scenario and checking for the presence of the issue described (understanding that in reality the validation of output would require inspection of the generated documentation).

The approach to simulate this requires a bit of creativity because the core issue revolves around Sphinx's handling of type links in generated documentation, which isn't directly reproducible via a simple Python script execution. However, we can structure a script that sets up a minimal Sphinx project with necessary files, runs Sphinx, and then checks the generated output for the expected clickable link. This mock-up will not fully replicate the manual check of a clickable link but will simulate checking for the expected reference format in the generated documentation source (e.g., HTML). 

This solution is more complex than what you might typically find in a single Python file due to the need to interact with external commands (Sphinx) and inspect file outputs. Nonetheless, it's a valuable demonstration of how one could automate testing of documentation generation issues to some extent.

Instructions and Limitations:
- This script presumes Sphinx is installed and accessible via the command line.
- It dynamically creates a minimal Sphinx project setup with necessary files that mimic the bug scenario.
- It then runs Sphinx to generate the documentation and checks for the presence of the issue by looking for the Unit type in the HTML content.
- This solution somewhat oversimplifies the issue; manually checking the generated HTML for a clickable link or the correct referencing format would be necessary for a definitive confirmation.

Environment considerations:
- It needs to be run in an environment where file writes are permitted and where Sphinx can be executed.
- This script directly interacts with the file system and subprocess module, making assumptions about the environment it's executed in.
