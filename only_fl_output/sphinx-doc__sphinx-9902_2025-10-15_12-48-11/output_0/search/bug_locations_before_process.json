This could involve tweaking autodoc settings, intersphinx mappings, or other Sphinx extensions that manage domain objects and references. Specifically, ensuring that Sphinx's autodoc extension can resolve short names to their full canonical paths for linking purposes, possibly through custom extensions or event handlers that enrich type information during the documentation build process."
