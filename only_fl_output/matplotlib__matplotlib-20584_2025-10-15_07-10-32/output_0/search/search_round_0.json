Unfortunately, I noticed that the result is much coarser than without manipulation. In fact, a simple `lc.set_segments(lc.get_segments())` has this effect. I would have expected this does nothing at all.\nMWE:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nx = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)\ny = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nZ = X ** 2 + Y ** 2\nc = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[1.0], colors=\"k\")\n# reset segments\nlc = c.collections[0]\nsegments = lc.get_segments()\nlc.set_segments(segments)\nplt.gca().set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.show()\n```\n|  ![sc1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181628/123953915-11206180-d9a8-11eb-9661-ce4363d19437.png) | ![sc2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/181628/123953934-17aed900-d9a8-11eb-8a50-88c6168def93.png) |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| default | with reset segments |\nThis is with mpl 3.4.2.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, I propose invoking the following API calls based on the elements mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. The issue relates to the manipulation of line segments after plotting with `contourf`, specifically mentioning `set_segments()` and `get_segments()` methods on a collection. It's likely that these methods are part of a class dealing with contour plots or line collections in Matplotlib. First, we need to find out which class `lc` (line collection) belongs to, and then we can inspect the methods of concern.\n\n2. We need to investigate how the `set_segments()` and `get_segments()` methods are implemented for this collection to understand why re-applying segments would result in a loss of detail.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"set_segments\")\nsearch_method(\"get_segments\")\n```\n\n3. Given that the issue is demonstrated using a contour plot, it would also be insightful to look into the implementation of the `contour` function to see if there's any preprocessing or postprocessing of segments that happens within this context, which might not be preserved when segments are manually set.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"contour\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"contour\", \"Axes\")\n```\n\n4. Since the issue mentions a specific behavior regarding visual output and possibly relates to internal handling of data within these methods, understanding the mechanism of how segments are stored, manipulated, or transformed can give clues to the root cause of the coarseness.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"c.collections[0]\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to get an overview of the relevant classes, methods, and the specific usage of collection handling within the contour plotting process. This context should help in diagnosing the issue and forming a basis for a potential fix."
