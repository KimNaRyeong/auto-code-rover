To address the request while acknowledging previous feedback and aiming to directly reproduce the issue, here is a corrected approach for a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script will attempt to programmatically identify the coarse effect on line segments by measuring an aspect of the line segments before and after the reset operation (`set_segments(get_segments())`). Given the graphical nature of this issue, let's focus on an indirect method by utilizing segment lengths or counts as a proxy for coarseness. Please be aware that directly correlating this with "coarseness" could be challenging, so this interpretation may need adjustment.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    try:
        x = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)
        y = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)
        X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
        Z = X ** 2 + Y ** 2

        # Plotting with contour
        c = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[1.0], colors="k")

        # Retrieving the line collection before reset
        lc = c.collections[0]
        original_segments = lc.get_segments()

        # Assuming that plotting doesn't change the number of segments,
        # resetting segments should not change their number or contents
        lc.set_segments(original_segments)

        # Retrieving the line collection after reset to compare
        reset_segments = lc.get_segments()

        if not len(original_segments) == len(reset_segments):
            raise AssertionError("Number of segments changed after reset.")

        # Further check: Ensure actual segment data remains consistent
        for orig, reset in zip(original_segments, reset_segments):
            if not np.array_equal(orig, reset):
                raise AssertionError("Segment data altered after reset.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # General error exit
    else:
        print("Issue not present or fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This script presumes that the definition of "coarseness" could be observed through the number of segments or their data consistency before and after the reset. This assumption may or may not align perfectly with the visual coarseness observed in the plots. Hence, the detection of the issue as described might need a more sophisticate or direct graphical analysis approach for which Python scripts have limited capability without human visual inspection.
