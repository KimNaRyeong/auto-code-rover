        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### PyLinter Class (from `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The `PyLinter` class acts as the core of the linting process in Pylint, handling the integration of various components such as checkers, reporters, and managing the workflow of analyzing Python code to generate reports based on those analyses. It has methods to register checkers (`register_checker`), set reporters (`set_reporter`, `register_reporter`), and perform the linting process (`check`, `check_single_file`, etc.).\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:** The implementation for categorizing checkers/reporters might be here, but it's not directly visible from the provided snippets. Since the issue mentions moving from using `__implements__` to using `isinstance` checks through `ABCMeta`, modifications would likely be needed in how the `PyLinter` class registers and categorizes these checkers/reporters.\n\n- **Intended behavior post-issue resolution:** After resolving the issue, the `PyLinter` class should be able to categorize checkers/reporters based not only on the presence of an `__implements__` attribute but also through isinstance checks, ensuring compatibility with more standard Python practices (using abstract base classes). This would facilitate easier plugin development and integration for external contributors.\n\n#### `__implements__` Usage (from `pylint/interfaces.py` and `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The provided code snippets show that `__implements__` is used to mark or check what interfaces (or abstract base classes in a broader sense) a given class implements. The implementation provides a clear warning that relying on `__implements__` is deprecated and encourages using standard inheritance patterns.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:** This directly relates to the issue at hand. The project already acknowledges the need to move away from the custom `__implements__` system toward more conventional Python practices, aligning perfectly with the issue's proposal.\n\n- **Intended behavior post-issue resolution:** The references to `__implements__` should either be removed or significantly reduced, with abstract base classes and `isinstance` checks taking over the responsibility of identifying if a class implements a specific checker or reporter interface. The deprecation notice suggests that this is already a recognized direction for the project, and the proposed change would be a continuation of this shift.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the scope of the issue and the analysis of the context provided, the next steps involve:\n1. **Designing/Identifying Abstract Base Classes:** For each type of checker/reporter, abstract base classes need to be either identified or designed, ensuring they can serve as a standardized interface for plugin development.\n\n2. **Refactoring Registration and Categorization Logic:** The `PyLinter` class's methods for registering and utilizing checkers/reporters will need to be refactored. This involves replacing checks for `__implements__` with `isinstance` checks against the new abstract base classes.\n\n3. **Migration Plan:** For backward compatibility, a migration plan needs to be developed for existing plugins using the `__implements__` attribute, encouraging or automatically adapting them to use the new ABC-based approach.\n\n4. **Documentation:** Finally, updating documentation to clearly guide future developers on using the new system for creating plugins is crucial, emphasizing the ABCs and `isinstance` checks over the deprecated `__implements__` attribute.\n\nThis resolution plan should address the issue's core concerns while ensuring a smooth transition for existing and future plugins."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

To resolve the issue, this method should be modified to also (or instead) use `isinstance` checks to identify the checker type based on the newly created or existing abstract base classes (ABCs). The `isinstance` checks should be designed to work alongside the `__implements__` attribute during a transition period to ensure backward compatibility.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`\n  - **Class:** `PyLinter`\n  - **Method:** `register_reporter`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `register_checker`, `register_reporter` should be updated to categorize reporters based on their adherence to an ABC, using `isinstance` for this type-checking. The presence of an `__implements__` attribute can be used initially for backward compatibility, but the primary mechanism should be based on ABCs to align with Python standards and ease plugin development.\n\nConsidering that `__implements__` is already flagged for deprecation within the codebase, it's clear that the project intends to move towards a more standardized approach for plugin interfaces. The transition should be smooth and clear for plugin developers, with sufficient documentation and possibly helper tools or scripts to aid in the migration from `__implements__` to ABC-based interfaces."
