Let's structure our inquiry to cover these needs:\n\n1. **Find the current implementation of checkers/reporters**: To understand the use of `__implements__`, we'll need to locate where checkers/reporters are defined or referenced in the codebase.\n\n2. **Understand how PyLinter categorizes checkers/reporters**: This will likely involve looking at how PyLinter uses the `__implements__` attribute, meaning we need to find where this logic is implemented.\n\n3. **Identify the location of isinstance checks**: Before proposing changes, we should see if there are any existing `isinstance` checks that could be relevant to our changes.\n\nLet's begin with:\n- Searching for the `PyLinter` class to understand its structure and methods relevant to categorizing checkers/reporters.\n- Locating the `__implements__` attribute usage within the project to see how its currently employed for checkers/reporters.\n- Identifying key checkers or reporters to see their current setup before changing them to use ABCMeta.\n\nHere are the API calls to make:\n- search_class(\"PyLinter\")\n- search_code(\"__implements__\")"
