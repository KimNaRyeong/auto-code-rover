To resolve the issue, this method should be modified to also (or instead) use `isinstance` checks to identify the checker type based on the newly created or existing abstract base classes (ABCs). The `isinstance` checks should be designed to work alongside the `__implements__` attribute during a transition period to ensure backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `register_checker`, `register_reporter` should be updated to categorize reporters based on their adherence to an ABC, using `isinstance` for this type-checking. The presence of an `__implements__` attribute can be used initially for backward compatibility, but the primary mechanism should be based on ABCs to align with Python standards and ease plugin development."
