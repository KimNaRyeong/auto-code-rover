        "content": "To address the issue provided, we need to gather more context on how the `DecimalValidator` and `DecimalField` classes handle the validation process in the Django framework. We need to examine the implementations of these classes and any relevant methods like `clean` or `to_python` mentioned in the issue description, as well as the validator handling process that may have changed due to the commit mentioned.\n\nBased on the issue, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `DecimalValidator` class to understand its implementation and to see how it validates decimal values including those in scientific notation:\n   - `search_class(\"DecimalValidator\")`\n\n2. Search for the `DecimalField` class, specifically how it's implemented because the issue arises when the `clean` method of this class is called with scientific notation decimal values:\n   - `search_class(\"DecimalField\")`\n\n3. Search for the `clean` method within the `DecimalField` class as this is directly related to the issue raised. Understanding its implementation could reveal why validation fails for scientific notation:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DecimalField\")`\n\n4. Since the `to_python` method is mentioned as a workaround location, it's relevant to see how it's implemented within the `DecimalField` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DecimalField\")`\n\n5. The issue description mentions a specific commit where the change that introduced the bug occurred, so it's crucial to look into the changes made by this commit. While I cannot directly search by commit in this environment, inspecting the `run_validators` method mentioned in the stack trace could provide clues about the validation logic changes that may contribute to the issue:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"run_validators\", \"DecimalField\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive overview of how decimal validation is handled within Django's form fields and validators, giving us the necessary context to propose a solution or further investigate the issue."
