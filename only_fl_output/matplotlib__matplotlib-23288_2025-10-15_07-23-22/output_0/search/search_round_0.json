QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the described issue, we should first gather some context from the Matplotlib codebase, focusing on how text with URLs is handled, particularly when saving figures as PDFs. This process might involve checking how text is drawn, and how link annotations are added in the PDF backend. Relevant classes and methods likely pertain to PDF rendering and the handling of text objects, including their annotations.\n\nGiven the description of the issue, we aim to understand how rotating text interacts with URL link areas in the PDF. The issue hints at the need to either adjust the existing rectangle (Rect) representation of clickable areas or to correctly utilize \"QuadPoints\" for non-axis-aligned link areas.\n\nFirst, let's extract more details on the implementation of text object rendering in PDF files and the mechanism for embedding URLs into these objects:\n\n1. Search for the part of the code responsible for rendering text objects to PDF, which might involve methods related to drawing text or saving to PDF. We're particularly interested in how URLs are attached to text objects.\n2. Look into the classes or methods handling the PDF annotations for links, especially those managing the link area's geometry.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"savefig\")\n- search_code(\"plt.text\")\n- search_code(\"url\")\n- search_class(\"PDFPages\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"draw_text\", \"PDFPages\")"
