QuadPoints\r\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\r\nspecified by Rect.\r\n\r\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\r\n\r\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\nmain\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\ngit checkout\n"

To check whether the clickable area corresponds to the rotated text or not is a manual step, so instead of automatically raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (which isn't feasible due to the nature of the bug), this script outlines steps for manual verification.\n\nGiven the inability to programmatically detect whether a PDF viewer respects the rotated clickable area or default to the unrotated rectangle, the script includes instructions for manual verification.\n\nPlease follow the manual steps outlined in the comments at the end of the script to verify the issue.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        plt.text(0.5, 0.5, \"Long text with link\", rotation=45, url=\"https://matplotlib.org\")\n        plt.savefig(\"link.pdf\")\n        plt.close()\n        \n        # Since the clickable area's rotation cannot be programmatically verified,\n        # perform the following manual steps:\n        # 1.

Try clicking on the rotated text \"Long text with link\".\n        # - If clicking the rotated text opens the hyperlink, the issue is fixed.\n        # - If you need to click where the text would be if it were not rotated \n        #   (i.e., the horizontal bounds of the original non-rotated text), \n        #   then the issue persists.\n        print(\"Generated 'link.pdf'.

The script generates a PDF file named `link.pdf` with rotated text containing a hyperlink.\n2. After running the script, you need to manually open the `link.pdf` file in a PDF viewer.\n3. Attempt to click the hyperlink by targeting the visually correct location of the rotated text.\n4. If your click activates the hyperlink correctly, this would indicate that the issue might have been resolved or your PDF viewer handles `QuadPoints` properly.\n5. If you need to click where the text would have been had it not been rotated (the horizontal space before rotation), this indicates that the issue is present, meaning the clickable area did not rotate with the text."
