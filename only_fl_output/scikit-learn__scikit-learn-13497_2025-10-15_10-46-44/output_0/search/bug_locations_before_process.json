        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior in the `_estimate_mi` method is to enhance how `discrete_features` is handled so that it robustly manages its values whether they're specified as 'auto', a boolean, or an array of indices/boolean mask. This involves implementing additional checks or logic to: \n\n- Correctly detect and process `discrete_features` when it is an array of indices or a boolean mask, ensuring compatibility with numpy's future versions that may enforce stricter type checks. This likely means refining the conditionals around lines 250-262 to more accurately and safely assess the nature of `discrete_features` and apply the appropriate logic for each case.\n\n- Ensure that the functionality remains the same for existing checks (i.e., when `discrete_features` is 'auto' or a boolean), but adds safeguards or more explicit type handling to prevent future errors with numpy compatibility.\n\nThis update is critical to preserve existing functionality while also ensuring compatibility with future versions of numpy and maintaining the flexibility of handling different types of inputs for `discrete_features`. The change should be made with minimal impact on the method's efficiency and overall logic flow."
