        "intended_behavior": "The `register_cmap` function must ensure that a colormap, once registered with a specified name, is accessible under that name through any subsequent call to `get_cmap` or when used in plotting functions like `imshow`. This method should validate or enforce that the registered name takes precedence over the intrinsic name of the colormap object for all retrievals and uses within matplotlib. This adjustment ensures that user-defined names for colormaps are consistently recognized across the library without causing confusion or errors due to name mismatches."

        "method": "get_cmap",
        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cmap` function should be adjusted to accurately retrieve colormaps by their registered names, prioritizing these over the intrinsic names given to colormap objects upon their creation. If a colormap has been registered with a custom name, `get_cmap` must resolve this name to the correct colormap object, ensuring that the colormap can be utilized in functions like `imshow` seamlessly. This enhancement assures that the registration name fully supersedes the original name for all practical purposes inside the matplotlib framework."
