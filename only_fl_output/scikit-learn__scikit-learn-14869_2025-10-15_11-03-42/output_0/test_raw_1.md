Given the clarification, I propose an adjusted `reproducer.py` that correctly raises an `AssertionError` when the issue occurs and is more aligned with your exact requirements for issue demonstration. This script aims to pinpoint the scenario you described with the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` when using `categorical_crossentropy` on a binary classification problem. 

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # noqa
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    import numpy as np

    X = np.array([[1, 0],
                  [1, 0],
                  [1, 0],
                  [0, 1],
                  [1, 1]])
    y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])

    gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                                        min_samples_leaf=1)
    gb.fit(X, y)
    pred_1 = gb.predict([[1, 0]])[0]
    pred_2 = gb.predict([[0, 1]])[0]

    # Checking if predictions make sense for binary classification
    if not (pred_1 == 1 and pred_2 == 0):
        raise AssertionError("Predictions do not align with expected binary classification outcomes.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 indicating the issue is present

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("The test has passed successfully.", file=sys.stdout)
sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 indicating the issue was not found or has been fixed
```

This script will function as a diagnostic tool to check if the issue you described is present. It attempts to fit a binary classification model using `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` with `categorical_crossentropy` and then makes predictions on simple inputs. If the predictions do not align with the expected binary outcomes (which in this case would be `[1]` for the first input and `[0]` for the second), it raises an `AssertionError` demonstrating the failure of the classifier under these conditions. This error, alongside a detailed stack trace, helps in pinpointing the failure's origin. The script concludes successfully if and when this issue is resolved, exiting with code 0 to indicate the absence of the problem.
