        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to look into how the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` class handles the `loss` parameter, particularly with the value `categorical_crossentropy`, and how it behaves differently when `binary_crossentropy` is used or should be used. This requires inspecting the implementation details of this class, as well as potentially looking into how loss functions are utilized within.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the HistGradientBoostingClassifier Class**: To understand how the `loss` argument is processed and to see if there's specific handling or validation logic for the `categorical_crossentropy` value in binary classification cases.\n   - `search_class(\"HistGradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n\n2. **Search for the Fit Method within HistGradientBoostingClassifier**: Since the issue occurs during model training (`fit` method call), examining this method should provide insights into how the `loss` argument influences the training process.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"HistGradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n\n3. **Search for Usage of Categorical_Crossentropy and Binary_Crossentropy**: To understand how these specific loss functions are defined and possibly identify if there's a fallback mechanism from `categorical_crossentropy` to `binary_crossentropy` for binary classification tasks or any missing validation that leads to silent failures.\n   - `search_code(\"categorical_crossentropy\")`\n   - `search_code(\"binary_crossentropy\")`"
