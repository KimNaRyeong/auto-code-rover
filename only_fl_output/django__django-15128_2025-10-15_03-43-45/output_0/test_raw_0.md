Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to reproduce the specified issue with `Query.change_aliases` raising an `AssertionError` in a Django environment. Before you run this script, ensure your Django project is set up correctly, including the necessary models and app configurations. For this script to work, your models should reflect the structure described in your issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

import django
from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Q

# Define models according to the issue description

    bazes = models.ManyToManyField("Baz", related_name="quxes")

Please replace `'your_project.settings'` with the path to your Django project settings module. This script assumes the presence of a Django application with the defined models `Qux`, `Foo`, `Bar`, and `Baz`, mirroring the structure provided in the issue description.

This script attempts an OR operation between two QuerySets (`qs1 | qs2` and then `qs2 | qs1`) expecting the latter to raise an `AssertionError` as described, catching and printing the stack trace for analysis. Note that the behavior observed might depend on the versions of Django you are using as specified, and make sure your Django project is prepared to handle these model definitions and queries.
