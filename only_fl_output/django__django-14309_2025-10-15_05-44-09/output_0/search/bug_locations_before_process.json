        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here should ensure that when combining a `Q` object with another (especially an `Exists` object that has been negated), the `negated` state of the resultant `Q` object accurately reflects the combination. If an `Exists` object is negated and then combined with a `Q` object, the `_combine` method should correctly handle and propagate the negation. This involves potentially adjusting its logic to check and maintain the `negated` status of both operands involved in the operation. The adjustment should preserve the existing functionality for all other combinations of `Q` objects and maintain backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "While the implementation of `__invert__` in `Exists` may not be directly flawed, ensuring that its behavior correctly toggles the `negated` state and that this state is recognized and preserved when combined with `Q` objects is essential. The method should ensure that negating an `Exists` instance properly sets a flag or attribute that is correctly interpreted when combined using `&` or any other operation with `Q` objects. Any adjustment here should ensure that the negated state of `Exists` is both set and readable in a way that `Q`'s combination mechanisms can interpret without altering the expected behavior for other use cases."
