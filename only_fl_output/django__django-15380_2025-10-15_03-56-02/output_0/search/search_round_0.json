Search for the `MigrationAutodetector` class.\n2. Search for methods within the `MigrationAutodetector` class, particularly `changes` and `generate_renamed_fields`.\n3. Search for the method that executes the `makemigrations` command. Since the specific class or file isn't mentioned, we'll use a method search across the entire codebase.\n4. Search for code references that might give insights into how `self.to_state.models` is manipulated or accessed throughout the migration process.\n\nLet's execute these searches:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"changes\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"generate_renamed_fields\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")`\n- `search_method(\"handle\", \"makemigrations\")`\n- `search_code(\"self.to_state.models\")`"
