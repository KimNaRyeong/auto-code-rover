Since the search for the specified file, classes, and method in the bug report returned no results, we cannot precisely identify the bug locations or propose an intended behavior without further context. However, the issue describes a general behavior problem concerning Sphinx's autodoc extension and its handling of inherited class methods:\n\n- Bug Location: The issue is conceptual at this point without specific file paths. Yet, it concerns any subclass (like `Child`) that overrides a classmethod from its superclass (like `Parent`) without redefining the docstring, in projects where Sphinx autodoc is used for documentation generation.\n  \n- Intended Behavior: The intended behavior would involve Sphinx's autodoc extension or the project's handling of inherited methods to automatically use the superclass's docstring for an overridden method in a subclass if the subclass method does not define its own docstring. This behavior would ensure that documentation remains complete and accurate even when subclass methods do not explicitly redefine the inherited documentation. This could involve adjustments in how Sphinx or the project inspects method docstrings for inheritance, potentially requiring a patch or configuration change that ensures docstring inheritance is respected by the documentation generation process."
