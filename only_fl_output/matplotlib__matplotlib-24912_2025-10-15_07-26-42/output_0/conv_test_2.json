While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\r\nprint( myplot.levels )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\r\n\r\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif not self.filled:\r\n            inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\r\n            levels_in = self.levels[inside]\r\n            if len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\r\n                self.levels = [self.zmin]\r\n                _api.warn_external(\r\n                    \"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\r\n```\n"

Given the issue is that Matplotlib's `contour()` function is incorrectly autoscaling contour levels when they are completely outside the data range, the script below is designed to capture this specific behavior and verify it against what's expected \u2013 that is, the provided contour levels should remain unchanged regardless of whether they fall within the data range.\n\nThe standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` attempts to accurately provide evidence of the issue. When executed, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, accompanied by a stack trace for clarity.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_contour_level_autoscaling():\n    # Generating some data that is entirely within a known range\n    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)\n    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n    Z = np.sin(X**2 + Y**2) * 40\n\n    # Defining contour levels that are outside the range of the generated data\n    contour_levels = [100]\n\n    try:\n        plt.figure()\n        cp = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=contour_levels)\n        plt.close('all')\n        # The assertion fails if the levels are not exactly as specified\n        assert list(cp.levels) == contour_levels, f\"Expected levels {contour_levels} but got {list(cp.levels)}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise SystemExit(1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_contour_level_autoscaling()\n```\n\nThis script will:\n\n1. Generate a dataset where the data range is known and controlled.\n2. Attempt to generate contour plots using `contour_levels` that are deliberately set outside this range to trigger the issue.\n3. Assert whether the resulting contour plot levels match the explicitly set levels. If they do not match due to Matplotlib's autoscaling behavior (adjusting levels based on the data range), the assertion will fail.\n4. If an `AssertionError` is raised, it prints a stack trace before exiting with code 1, indicating that the issue is present. If no error is raised, the script exits quietly with code 0, suggesting the issue is resolved."
