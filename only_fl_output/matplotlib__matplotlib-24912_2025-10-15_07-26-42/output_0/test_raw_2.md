Here's an updated standalone Python script designed to reproduce the reported issue. When executed, this script will unequivocally replicate the condition under which contour level autoscaling overrides user-specified levels in Matplotlib. Specifically, it creates a scenario where all given contour levels fall outside the range of the dataset, which, according to the issue description, triggers autoscaling in a manner deemed incorrect by the user.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Generating simplified data where the entire dataset falls into a known range
    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)
    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    data = X**2 + Y**2  # Data range is [0, 2]

    # Attempting to plot contour with levels entirely outside the data range
    requested_levels = [100]  # Entirely outside data range

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    cnt = ax.contour(X, Y, data, levels=requested_levels)
    ax.clabel(cnt, inline=True, fontsize=8)

    try:
        # Check if the plotted contour levels match the requested contour levels
        assert np.array_equal(cnt.levels, requested_levels), "Contour levels were auto-scaled!"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    finally:
        plt.close(fig)

    print("Test passed: Contour levels were not auto-scaled.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
- Generates a simple 2D dataset with a known range.
- Attempts to plot contours with levels that are explicitly outside the range of the data, which should highlight the issue if contour autoscaling is indeed overriding user-specified levels.
- Checks whether the actual levels used in the plot match the ones requested. If they differ, indicating that autoscaling occurred despite the explicit request, the script asserts an error.
- Uses the previously given function to print a detailed stack trace for any `AssertionError` encountered, aiding in diagnosing the exact point of failure.

Should you run this script in an environment where the described behavior persists, you would receive an `AssertionError`, confirming the presence of the issue. Conversely, if the issue is fixed (i.e., Matplotlib no longer overrides specified contour levels with auto-scaled ones when all requested levels fall outside the data range), the script should exit with code 0, indicating a pass.
