It seems there was a misunderstanding about the previous execution context, possibly due to an incorrectly configured environment rather than the specific issue regarding `LabelEncoder` you're interested in. Let's ensure the script is corrected for the task at hand, focusing on the details of your original problem:

Given the intended use of `LabelEncoder` with Python 3.6.3 and scikit-learn 0.19.1, and considering the error is about transforming empty lists following the fitting with different types, I'll reformulate the `reproducer.py` script accordingly.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_labelencoder_with_empty_transform():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    import numpy as np

    le = LabelEncoder()
    try:
        # Numeric Labels: should work
        le.fit([1, 2])
        assert np.array_equal(le.transform([]), np.array([], dtype=int)), "Transforming empty list after numeric fit fails"

        # String Labels: expected to raise an exception due to the bug
        le.fit(["a", "b"])
        # If the below line executes without error, the issue is resolved, hence AssertionError should not be raised.
        transformed = le.transform([])
        # Should not reach this if the bug exists
        print("Issue seems to be fixed as empty transform didn't fail after fitting with strings.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is reproduced.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_labelencoder_with_empty_transform()
```

This script, when executed, will attempt to reproduce the issue as described: It fits `LabelEncoder` with both numerical and string labels, then checks if transforming an empty list causes an error. The `AssertionError` is raised only if the documented issue is reproduced (i.e., it fails for string labels). If the script completes without error or raises an assertion for the string label case, it indicates the issue is resolved or not present.
