The two queries are the same !!!\\n')\noutput\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\")\nQUERY 2: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\n!!! The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals insights into the functionality of Django's `QuerySet` methods `select_related`, `_clone`, and `prefetch_related`, while also indicating the absence of direct information about the model classes `ModelA`, `ModelB`, and `ModelC` from the codebase. Let's delve into each part based on the questions posed:\n\n### 1. `select_related` Method in `QuerySet`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `select_related` method returns a new `QuerySet` instance that will select related objects. It's designed to include related object fields specified by ForeignKey fields in a single database query. The method modifies the `QuerySet`'s `query.select_related` attribute based on the fields passed to it: enabling, disabling, or specifically setting related fields to be fetched.\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  Since `select_related` seemingly returns a new `QuerySet` via `self._chain()`, which internally might call `_clone`, the original `QuerySet` should not be mutated. However, the bug indicates that the original `QuerySet` is affected when `select_related` is called on a cloned instance, suggesting an unexpected sharing of state between the original and cloned `QuerySet` instances.\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  The intended behavior would be that the original `QuerySet` remains unchanged when additional `select_related` calls are made on its clones, ensuring each `QuerySet` instance operates independently.\n\n### 2. `_clone` Method in `QuerySet`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `_clone` function is designed to return a copy of the current `QuerySet`, serving as a lightweight alternative to deep copying. It preserves the context of the original `QuerySet` while intending to create a distinct new instance.\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  The core of the issue likely revolves around this method. It's crucial that `_clone` creates a truly independent copy of the `QuerySet`, including its underlying query configuration. If references are not handled correctly (e.g., deep vs shallow copy issues), changes in a cloned `QuerySet` could inadvertently affect its parent, explaining the unexpected mutation observed.\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  A cloned `QuerySet` should behave independently from its original. Any modifications made to the clone, such as additional calls to `select_related`, should not impact the original `QuerySet`'s state.\n\n### 3. `prefetch_related` Method in `QuerySet`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  Similar to `select_related`, `prefetch_related` returns a modified `QuerySet` that will prefetch specified related objects upon evaluation. However, unlike `select_related`, `prefetch_related` deals with \u201cmany-to\u201d relationships and executes separate queries for each relationship.\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  The implementation detail of `prefetch_related` using `_chain` (which likely uses `_clone`) for cloning and altering the prefetch commands hints at a pattern that may exhibit similar unexpected mutation behaviors as encountered with `select_related`.\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  Despite being executed through separate queries, modifications to prefetch directives on a cloned `QuerySet` must not affect the configuration of the original `QuerySet`. Each instance should maintain its own set of prefetch directives.\n\n### Absence of Model Class Information\n- **Missing Context:**  \n  The inability to find classes `ModelA`, `ModelB`, and `ModelC` suggests either these models are defined outside the scanned project scope or named differently. Given the bug's context, these models likely play a role in defining the relationships necessary to reproduce the issue but are not directly responsible for the mutation behavior observed.\n- **Next Steps:**  \n  Considering the models could either be external or the search parameters insufficient (for example, assuming these models were in the namespace `foobar`, it wasn\u2019t explicitly searched), further search attempts could involve exploring namespaced model declarations or examining app-level model definitions within the Django project structure, potentially using variations of naming or deeper exploration into related modules.\n\nIn summary, the core issue revolves around the expected immutability of cloned `QuerySet` instances post-modification through `select_related` and potentially `prefetch_related`, pointing towards a need for a deeper investigation into how cloned instances maintain their state and ensure independence from their originals."

However, it must ensure that any modifications made after `select_related` is called on a cloned `QuerySet` instance do not impact the original `QuerySet` from which the clone was derived. This could potentially require examining the `_chain` method or the way `query` objects are handled to ensure deep copying of relevant parts to prevent shared state between clones and originals.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**  \n  **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`  \n  **Class:** `QuerySet`  \n  **Method:** `_clone`  \n  **Intended Behavior:** The `_clone` method's intended behavior is to produce a fully independent copy of the `QuerySet`, which implies no shared state between the original and the cloned instance that could lead to the mutations observed. A thorough review is necessary to ensure that all attributes, especially those that can be modified like `query` (which houses `select_related` logic), are correctly deep copied or uniquely instantiated to preserve this independence. This might involve changing the way references to mutable objects (like dicts or custom objects) are copied, ensuring a true deep copy is made where necessary.\n\nThese locations are critical to resolving the issue as they directly relate to the unexpected mutation of the original `QuerySet`. Ensuring independence between cloned and original `QuerySets` while preserving functionality will address the problem presented."
