The two queries are the same !!!\\n')\noutput\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\")\nQUERY 2: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\n!!! The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the unexpected mutation of original QuerySet when using `select_related` in Django, I propose to invoke the following API calls based on the information provided:\n\n1. Search for details about the `select_related` method within the QuerySet class to understand how it is implemented and to investigate where the mutation might be occurring.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"select_related\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n2. Since the issue description mentions that QuerySet methods call `self._clone()` and it is expected to return a new QuerySet instance without affecting the original, it's crucial to investigate how `_clone` is implemented and ensure it's performing as expected.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_clone\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. Given that `select_related` is specifically mentioned alongside `prefetch_related`, and both seem to exhibit similar undesired behavior, examining the implementation of `prefetch_related` could provide insights into a possibly common flaw or an area where their implementations might affect the QuerySet's immutability.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"prefetch_related\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n4. The models `ModelA`, `ModelB`, and `ModelC` are directly involved in the issue. To fully understand the context and possibly spot any custom behaviors that might influence the outcome, it's beneficial to look into their definitions.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelA\")`\n   - `search_class(\"ModelB\")`\n   - `search_class(\"ModelC\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a detailed view of how `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are designed to work with QuerySets, the role of `_clone` in maintaining or failing to maintain the immutability of QuerySets, and whether there's something specific about the models involved that could be contributing to this issue."
