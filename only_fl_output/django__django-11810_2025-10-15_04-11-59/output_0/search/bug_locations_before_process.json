However, it must ensure that any modifications made after select_related is called on a cloned QuerySet instance do not impact the original QuerySet from which the clone was derived. This could potentially require examining the _chain method or the way query objects are handled to ensure deep copying of relevant parts to prevent shared state between clones and originals."

        "intended_behavior": "The _clone method's intended behavior is to produce a fully independent copy of the QuerySet, which implies no shared state between the original and the cloned instance that could lead to the mutations observed. A thorough review is necessary to ensure that all attributes, especially those that can be modified like query (which houses select_related logic), are correctly deep copied or uniquely instantiated to preserve this independence. This might involve changing the way references to mutable objects (like dicts or custom objects) are copied, ensuring a true deep copy is made where necessary."
