Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

Specifically, we are looking for how pylint evaluates linting scores and error categories to decide on its exit code behavior. The new feature request suggests modifying or extending this logic to allow for more granular failure conditions.\n\nHere are the API calls that will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that handles the evaluation of pylint exit codes based on linting scores and detected issues. Since the issue mentions a `--fail-under` option, we should look for a method that processes this argument.\n\n2. Search for the code that initializes or parses command-line arguments (`--fail-under` and potentially a new `--fail-on` argument), as we might need to add a new option.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls will be made:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_options\")`: To find the method that handles command-line argument parsing, where `--fail-under` is likely parsed, and to understand where to add the new `--fail-on` option.\n- `search_method(\"evaluate_exit_code\")`: Assuming a method like this exists based on the description of the issue, it would be where pylint decides what exit code to return based on linting results.\n- `search_code(\"--fail-under\")`: To directly find references to how the `--fail-under` option is currently used within the codebase.

Therefore, we need to adjust our search approach to still gather the necessary context for addressing the issue. The lack of results suggests we may need to use broader or alternate terms related to the functionality or configuration options in pylint. Specifically, we should look into how pylint processes its command-line arguments in general and how it determines its exit status based on linting outcomes.\n\nNew angles for our search might include:\n\n- Looking for a more generic method that handles all command-line arguments. Since `parse_options` didn't yield results, pylint might use a different mechanism or naming convention for parsing arguments.\n- Finding how pylint categorizes issues (like errors, warnings) and calculates scores, given that specific information about `--fail-under` wasn't directly found. This could provide insight into where we might hook in the new functionality.\n- Investigating how pylint's current exit status is decided based on detected issues and scores might not be straightforwardly named `evaluate_exit_code`.\n\nGiven this revised approach, the next set of API calls should aim to find these broader aspects of pylint's operation:\n\n1. **Search for Code Related to Argument Parsing:** Since the specific method name `parse_options` was not found, we might look for any code that references command-line argument parsing.\n\n2. **Search for Code Handling Exit Status:** Instead of looking for a method named `evaluate_exit_code`, we look for any hints on how pylint assigns its exit status after running checks.\n\n3. **Search for Issue Categorization:** Understanding how pylint categorizes issues might lead to where we could implement a check for specific issue types or codes.\n\nLet's proceed with adjusted API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"ArgumentParser\")`: This could lead us to where pylint's command-line interface is defined.\n- `search_code(\"exit\")`: This might return results related to how pylint determines when to exit and what status code to return.\n- `search_code(\"issue categories\")`: To try and understand how pylint might organize or categorize issues, which could be related to implementing the `--fail-on` functionality."
