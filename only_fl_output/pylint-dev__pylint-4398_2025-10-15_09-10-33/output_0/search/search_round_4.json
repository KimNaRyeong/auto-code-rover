Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

However, these files seem unrelated to the core functionality of pylint regarding command-line argument parsing for running checks. They are more likely examples or utility scripts.\n   - Since neither of these locations directly relates to the bug (which involves adding new command-line options to pylint itself), it indicates we haven't yet found the relevant part of the codebase that handles global pylint command-line arguments.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `exit` in the codebase:**\n   - There are numerous mentions of `exit` throughout the codebase, with a high concentration in `pylint/lint/run.py` (27 matches). This suggests that `pylint/lint/run.py` is a significant file regarding how pylint runs and determines when to exit (potentially along with deciding what exit code to use based on linting results).\n   - The relationship between these finds and the bug is that the `pylint/lint/run.py` file is highly likely where we need to introduce changes or enhancements to implement the `--fail-on` feature and address the mentioned issue of handling exit codes in conjunction with `--fail-under` and specific issue types.\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior we are looking to implement in `pylint/lint/run.py` (or similarly critical files discovered through `exit` searches) includes:\n     - Parsing and understanding a new `--fail-on` command-line option.\n     - Integrating logic that evaluates linting results against the criteria specified by `--fail-on` (e.g., looking for specific issue types like error categories or specific issue codes) and deciding on the appropriate exit code.\n\n3. **Search for \"issue categories\":**\n   - Since this search did not yield results, it implies that \"issue categories\" might not be the terminology used within the pylint codebase or that it's described differently.\n   - A more focused search might be needed to understand how pylint categorizes different lint issues (e.g., by searching for specific issue codes or how pylint defines the severities of issues).\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n1. **We still need more context:** specifically around how pylint handles its core argument parsing for functionalities related to linting operations and how it categorizes issues to potentially tap into for the `--fail-on` logic.\n\n2. **Preliminary bug location:** The bug location that needs to be fixed or extended is likely within:\n   \n   - **File:** `pylint/lint/run.py` (and potentially other related files in the `pylint/lint` directory)\n   - We suspect that within this file, we'll find the logic for handling exit codes and possibly where we'd integrate the parsing of a new `--fail-on` option and the logic to assess linting outcomes against this criteria.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The code at this location should be enhanced to:\n   \n   - Parse and recognize a new `--fail-on` option from the command line.\n   - After linting is complete, evaluate if any of the issues found match the criteria specified by `--fail-on`.\n   - This evaluation should occur in such a way that it complements the existing `--fail-under` option, allowing both options to work in tandem without one overshadowing the other. For instance, it should be possible for pylint to fail if the score is above the threshold set by `--fail-under` but error-category issues specified in `--fail-on` are detected.\n\nGiven this analysis, further investigation is needed to precisely locate and understand the current implementation of command-line argument parsing and issue categorization within pylint's codebase to address the issue correctly."

These elements are crucial for implementing a feature like `--fail-on`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to enhance the command-line interface to accept a new option (`--fail-on`) and to ensure the linting process considers this option when evaluating the presence of issues and deciding on the exit status. This involves identifying where command-line arguments are processed and where the lint results are evaluated for severity and type against this new option.\n\nGiven the lack of direct findings, we need to pivot to broader, perhaps more general inquiries or re-examine the codebase's structure to determine an alternative path for finding these locations. The main goal remains to understand where pylint's CLI arguments are defined and handled, and how lint results are categorized and impact the exit status.\n\nConsidering the lack of specific results, a broader strategy could include:\n\n- Examining the main entry point of pylint or closely related scripts and modules where command-line interface setup and lint result evaluation would logically occur.\n- Reviewing pylint's documentation or developer resources that might outline the codebase's architecture or directly checking the repository for clues on where to find these implementations.\n\nGiven the constraints of this interaction model and without further query possibilities, the next steps would logically be manually inspecting `pylint/lint/run.py` or similar files and directories (despite the named file not containing the search targets), going through README or CONTRIBUTING documents for guidance on the code structure, or examining the primary execution scripts/modules that bootstrap the pylint application.\n\nFor addressing the issue without further API queries, focusing on known or discovered entry points for pylint's execution (e.g., setup scripts, main application modules) and manually tracing how command-line arguments are parsed and how lint checks are performed (including how they influence exit codes) will be necessary. Identifying classes or modules that encapsulate the linting process and looking for existing configurations or extension points relevant to implementing the `--fail-on` functionality will be key despite the specific search challenges encountered."
