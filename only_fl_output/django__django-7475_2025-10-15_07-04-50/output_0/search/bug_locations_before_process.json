Dynamically loading the specified settings module if the new argument is provided. This could be done using Python's importlib.import_module to import the specified module dynamically. 2. Comparing the loaded settings module's settings against the project's current settings or Django's default settings (whichever is relevant based on the user's input). 3. Formatting and outputting the differences in settings as currently done, but based on the comparison against the specified module. The existing functionality must remain unaffected when the new argument is not used, thus preserving backward compatibility."
