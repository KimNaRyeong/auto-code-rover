Given the task and considering the error encountered previously, I'll adjust the approach to ensure that the environment setup issue does not obstruct the reproducibility of the initial reported issue (overflow with `StandardScaler` and `float16`). This version of `reproducer.py` includes the same functionality but assumes the environment has been corrected for an accurate test scenario.

Ensure your environment is set up correctly before executing this script, particularly if working with `scikit-learn`. The mentioned build issue often arises from an incomplete installation or a mismatch in environment setups. It could be beneficial to create a clean environment and reinstall the necessary packages.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    sample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    transformed_sample = scaler.fit_transform(sample)
    
    # Check if the result contains NaNs which indicates the overflow issue.
    assert not np.isnan(transformed_sample).any(), "Result contains NaNs due to overflow."
    print("Test passed: No overflow encountered.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the test failed due to the assertion
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred that prevented the test from completing.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
else:
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code if the issue is fixed or not encountered
```

This script is designed to exit with code 0 under successful conditions where the issue is fixed or not encountered, thereby adhering to your instruction for indicating resolution. If the environment setup issue (`No module named 'sklearn.__check_build._check_build'`) persists, please ensure that `scikit-learn` is installed correctly in your environment. You might need to reinstall `scikit-learn` or set up a new virtual environment if problems continue.
