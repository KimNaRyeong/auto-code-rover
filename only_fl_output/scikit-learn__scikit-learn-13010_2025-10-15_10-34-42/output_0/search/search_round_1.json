I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **StandardScaler Implementation:**\n    - The `StandardScaler` class is found in `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py`. It contains methods for initializing the scaler, fitting data to compute the mean and standard deviation (`fit`), as well as transforming and inverting transformations on the data. The `fit` method is of particular interest because it computes the mean and standard deviation which are central to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **fit Method:**\n    - The `fit` method in `StandardScaler` is designed to compute the mean and standard deviation for later scaling. It accepts data `X` and an ignored `y`, indicating it's primarily concerned with features in `X`. This method resets internal state before calling `partial_fit` method, which implies the actual computation might be happening in `partial_fit`.\n\n3. **Relationship With the Bug:**\n    - The overflow error occurs when the `fit` method attempts to calculate the mean and standard deviation on a large `float16` numpy array. Based on the issue description and the role of the `fit` method, the overflow likely occurs during computations done in the `partial_fit` method, which means looking into `partial_fit` may provide insight into how these calculations are performed and how to prevent overflows.\n\n4. **Intended Behavior:**\n    - Ideally, the `StandardScaler` should be able to calculate mean and standard deviation without causing an overflow, regardless of the numpy array's dtype, especially for large datasets where memory efficiency (like using `float16`) is crucial. The intended behavior would involve safely computing these statistics possibly by using a data type that can handle the range of values without overflowing.\n\nGiven these reflections, the next steps would involve:\n- Investigating `partial_fit` in `StandardScaler` for details on how mean and std are computed.\n- Since the direct numpy mean and std class methods were not found, we should consider looking at how numpy's mean and std functions are used within the context of `StandardScaler`, potentially using a general search or examining their usage in `partial_fit`.\n- Understanding how numpy handles data type operations and how these operations might be adjusted within `StandardScaler` to prevent overflow with `float16` data types.\n\nTo continue with the analysis, we should invoke the following API calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"StandardScaler\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.mean\")` and `search_code(\"np.std\")` could also be helpful to understand the usage of numpy's mean and std functions in the context of the scaler, since direct class method searches for numpy were unsuccessful."
