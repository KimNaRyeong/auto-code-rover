        "intended_behavior": "For `float16` inputs: The method should ensure that any intermediate computation, such as sums and squares necessary for mean and variance calculation, is performed in a higher precision (e.g., `float32` or `float64`) to prevent overflow. After these computations, the method can cast the result back to `float16` if necessary for output consistency but store internal state in higher precision to maintain numerical stability across incremental fits. This adjustment should be applied selectively, only when the input dtype is `float16`, to minimize unnecessary computational overhead for other dtypes. Specific Implementation Note: Check for the dtype of `X` early in the method. If `X.dtype` is `float16`, cast `X` to `float32` before any operations that could lead to overflow. This includes operations done directly in `partial_fit` and within calls to `incr_mean_variance_axis` and `_incremental_mean_and_var`. The internal state (`self.mean_`, `self.var_`, `self.scale_`) should preferably be stored in `float32` to preserve precision across multiple `partial_fit` calls without sacrificing the memory efficiency gained from using `float16` for the input data."
