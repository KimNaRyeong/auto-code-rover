So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

The proposed solution suggests adding a helper function `make_and_validate_key` to the base cache backend class. Therefore, gathering context around the usage and implementation of these methods and any base cache backend class is crucial.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the base cache backend class where the new method `make_and_validate_key` would potentially be added.

        "content": "The collected context from the API calls reveals important information about the structure and organization of the cache backend system within the Django framework, specifically focusing on key construction and validation mechanisms.\n\n### Analysis of `make_key` Method Context\n\n- **Location and Definition**: The `make_key` method is defined in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` within the `BaseCache` class. This indicates that it serves as a foundational component for all cache backends built into Django or defined by users that inherit from this base class.\n- **Functionality**: The method constructs a cache key based on given parameters, such as a base key and a version. It applies a `key_func` to prepend the `key_prefix` and add the version to the key. This mechanism allows for versioning of cache keys and helps prevent key collisions across different versions.\n- **Relationship to the Issue**: The issue points out that the pattern of calling `make_key` followed by `validate_key` is repetitive across different parts of the cache backend system. Since `make_key` is located in the `BaseCache` class, adding a helper method here would inherently affect all subclasses, thereby addressing the issue of repetitiveness and consistency in key construction and validation across all cache backends.\n\n### Analysis of `validate_key` Method Context\n\n- **Location and Definition**: The results indicate that `validate_key` is also defined in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py`, suggesting that it is another central component of the cache backend system. Additional mentions in `memcached.py` imply specific implementations or calls to `validate_key` tailored for memcached backends.\n- **Functionality**: The purpose of `validate_key` is to ensure the validity of cache keys according to certain criteria, which might include checking for forbidden characters, lengths, or patterns that are incompatible with the backend storage mechanism. This validation step is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the cache system.\n- **Relationship to the Issue**: As described in the issue, after constructing a cache key with `make_key`, it is a common practice to validate this key. Incorporating these steps into a single helper function within the `BaseCache` class, such as `make_and_validate_key`, would streamline the process and guarantee that key validation is not overlooked in any cache backend implementation.\n\n### Intent for the New Helper Function\n\nBased on the issue description and the context gathered:\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The proposed `make_and_validate_key` method aims to encapsulate the two-step process of generating and then validating a cache key into a single operation. This will not only reduce redundancy in the codebase but also ensure a consistent approach to key management across various cache backends. \n- **Implementation Consideration**: Given the base class's central role in cache backend architecture, introducing `make_and_validate_key` here would automatically make this improved key management approach available to all cache backends in Django, both built-in and custom ones derived from `BaseCache`.\n\nIn conclusion, the collected context from `make_key` and `validate_key` provides a clear direction for implementing the issue's suggestion. The next step would involve writing the helper function in `base.py` within the `BaseCache` class, adhering to the guidelines and structure indicated by the current implementation of these methods."

Specifically, a new method, `make_and_validate_key`, will be added to the `BaseCache` class. This method will incorporate the functionality of both `make_key` and `validate_key` into a single call, streamlining operations for users and preserving the existing functionalities of making and validating keys. By doing so, it adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and ensures that every key creation is followed by a validation step, minimizing the potential for errors or oversight in key management processes across the cache system.\n  \n    **Proposed Method:** \n    ```python\n    def make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructs and validates a cache key, ensuring it adheres to the necessary\n        format and validity requirements before it's used in cache operations.\n        \"\"\"\n        key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\n        self.validate_key(key)\n        return key\n    ```\n    This method combines key construction and validation into a single workflow, encouraging consistent key management practices across all cache backend implementations derived from `BaseCache`."
