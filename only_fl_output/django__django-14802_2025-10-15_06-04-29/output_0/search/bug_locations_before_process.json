        "intended_behavior": "The proposal is not to fix a bug per se, but to enhance the architecture by reducing repetition and ensuring consistency in key handling across cache backends. Specifically, a new method, `make_and_validate_key`, will be added to the `BaseCache` class. This method will incorporate the functionality of both `make_key` and `validate_key` into a single call, streamlining operations for users and preserving the existing functionalities of making and validating keys. By doing so, it adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and ensures that every key creation is followed by a validation step, minimizing the potential for errors or oversight in key management processes across the cache system."
