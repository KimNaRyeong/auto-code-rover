Specifically, we should look into the `kernS` method mentioned in the issue, as well as the context in which it's being used to understand why the error \"`'kern' referenced before assignment`\" is occurring. Here are the API calls that can provide the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `kernS` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us identify where the `kernS` method is defined, which is crucial for understanding how it's supposed to work and why the error might be occurring.\n\n```python\nsearch_method('kernS')\n```\n\n2. **Search for the usage of the `kernS` method in the codebase**: This call will help us find how `kernS` is generally invoked across the project. It may provide insights into correct usage patterns and potentially highlight where the problem might be occurring if the bug is related to how `kernS` is being used.\n\n```python\nsearch_code('kernS')\n```\n\n3. **Get the code around the error occurrence**: If the error message provides a line number or if we can infer it from the stack trace or any additional context provided in the issue description, we could directly look into the specific part of the code where the error is raised. Assuming the error occurs near the usage of `kernS(text)` as shown in the description, finding the surrounding code could give us immediate insight into the cause. However, without a line number or file name, this specific API call cannot be effectively constructed.\n\nLet's start with these API calls to gather the necessary context for resolving the issue."
