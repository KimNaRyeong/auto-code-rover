        "intended_behavior": "The `formfield` method within the `ForeignKey` class should ensure that when generating form fields, especially when `limit_choices_to` is used and involves a join operation, it properly deduplicates options to prevent rendering duplicate choices in the form. This involves applying distinct filtering or processing the queryset results to ensure uniqueness based on the relevant keys or values. The implementation should be careful to maintain the existing functionality for cases where `limit_choices_to` does not lead to duplicates, and also support all other existing use cases without regression. The specific deduplication logic might involve adjustments in how querysets are composed or post-processing the queryset results before they are used to generate form choices."
