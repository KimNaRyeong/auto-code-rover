So if there are multiple calls to `caplog.set_level`, the level will be restored to that of the one-before-last call, instead of the value before the test.\nWill submit a fix for this shortly.\n</issue>"

Based on the given description, the bug is related to an incorrect \"set\" operation where \"setdefault\" should have been used instead, in context with multiple calls to `caplog.set_level`.\n\nGiven this, the initial set of API calls should aim at locating the `caplog.set_level` method's implementation and any relevant code around `_initial_handler_level`. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. Search for the method `set_level` within the caplog class to find its implementation: `search_method_in_class(\"set_level\", \"caplog\")`.\n2. Search for references to `_initial_handler_level` to see how and where it is being manipulated: `search_code(\"_initial_handler_level\")`.\n\nThese calls will help us locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue might be residing and give us a starting point for crafting a fix."
