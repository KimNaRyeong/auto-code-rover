        "intended_behavior": "Within the involved method(s) in src/_pytest/logging.py that manage logging levels via caplog.set_level, ensure that _initial_handler_level dictionary uses setdefault rather than set when updating handler levels for the first time. This change is crucial to ensure that the initial logging level of each handler is captured and preserved correctly before any test manipulates it. When restoring handler levels after a test, the restoration process should reference _initial_handler_level to set each handler's level back to its original state before the first set_level call in the test scope, ensuring true restoration to pre-test conditions. Ensure that if set_level is called multiple times within the same test, _initial_handler_level does not overwrite the initially stored level with subsequent calls. Only the first call's level should be stored as the initial state to be restored post-test. This restoration mechanism ensures that tests which modify logging levels do not interfere with each other by incorrectly setting up logging states based on the modifications made by previous tests within the same session."
