        "intended_behavior": "The `tex2uni` dictionary must be expanded to include mappings for the additional mathematical symbols specified in the issue. This involves identifying the LaTeX command strings for the missing Unicode points and adding new key-value pairs to the dictionary. The keys should be the LaTeX command names (assuming they exist and are standardized), and the values should be the corresponding Unicode points. This update is intended to enhance Matplotlib's mathematical text rendering capabilities by supporting a wider array of symbols. The additions must maintain the existing dictionary format and conventions to ensure consistency and readability. The implementation must ensure that this expansion does not interfere with the existing functionality, only extends it by making more symbols available for rendering in mathematical text."
