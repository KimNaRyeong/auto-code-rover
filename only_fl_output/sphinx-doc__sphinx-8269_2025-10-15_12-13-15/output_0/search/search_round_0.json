        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, I will gather more details about the implementation of the `linkcheck` functionality in Sphinx, focusing on how it differentiates between anchor errors and HTTP errors. Specifically, I will look for:\n\n- The class or method responsible for the `linkcheck` command execution.\n- How the tool checks for anchors in URLs and distinguishes between different types of errors (like a 404 HTTP error versus an anchor not found).\n- Configuration handling, specifically how the `linkcheck_anchors` setting toggles the behavior.\n\nGiven these requirements, I will start with the following API calls to locate the relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase:\n\n1. **Search for the command or method handling `linkcheck`:** Since `linkcheck` is a specific command in Sphinx, it's possible it's handled by a method or class dedicated to link checking within the project documentation.\n\n   ```\n   search_method(\"linkcheck\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for configuration handling related to `linkcheck_anchors`:** Understanding how the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration is used within the Sphinx project will be crucial to addressing the issue. This setting influences how anchors in URLs are validated, so finding where and how this setting is read will be important.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")\n   ``` \n\nThese initial searches should provide a solid starting point for understanding how Sphinx handles link checking, specifically in relation to HTTP errors and anchor validation, and will guide further investigation and code patching efforts."
