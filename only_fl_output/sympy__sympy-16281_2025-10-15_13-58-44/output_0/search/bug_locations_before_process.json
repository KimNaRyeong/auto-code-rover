        "intended_behavior": "This code location should be modified to handle the pretty printing of Product symbols more compactly and attractively. The modifications include:\n- Eliminating the unnecessary line at the bottom of the product (\u220f) symbol to make the output more compact.\n- Adjusting the width of the surrounding box to make the symbol less \"fat\", thereby aligning with the suggestions for a slimmer appearance without compromising readability.\n- Consideration should be given to extending the top bar of the \u220f symbol if it can be done without affecting the legibility of the printed expression. This must ensure the printed output remains mathematically correct and visually balanced.\n- These modifications must preserve the ability to toggle between Unicode and ASCII representations, respecting the `use_unicode` flag, thereby ensuring the functionality remains accessible to users with various display capabilities or preferences."
