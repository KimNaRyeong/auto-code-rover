Given the criteria you've set, here's a revised Python script named `reproducer.py` that directly addresses the problem described in your initial description. This script will actually try to check the output of the `pprint` (pretty print) function for `Product` instances as described, which should exhibit the formatting issue with additional lines and proportions as mentioned. Correct error handling with `AssertionError` when the issue persists and correct usage of `print_stacktrace` for error reporting are included.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Product, oo, pprint
import io
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def capture_pretty_print_output(expr):
    """Captures the output of pprint to a string."""
    old_stdout = sys.stdout
    result = io.StringIO()
    sys.stdout = result
    pprint(expr, use_unicode=False)  # Adjust based on specific issue replication
    sys.stdout = old_stdout
    result_string = result.getvalue()
    return result_string

def main():
    n = symbols('n')
    # Define products to pretty print
    product_1 = Product(1/n, (n, 1, oo))
    try:
        # Capture the pretty print output
        product_1_output = capture_pretty_print_output(product_1)
        
        # Example assertion to check the output
        # You should adjust the actual checks based on the issue you're expecting to catch
        expected_part = "\n|      | n\nn = 1"  # This is a simplistic check; update with correct expectation

        # Use this condition to demonstrate handling of issues:
        if expected_part not in product_1_output:
            raise AssertionError("Pretty print format for Product objects is incorrect or missing elements.")
        
        # If output matches expectations, indicate so (no changes necessary)
        print("Pretty print issue not reproduced; output matches expectations.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script assumes the problem is with the output format of a `Product` symbolically pretty printed. The `capture_pretty_print_output` function captures the output from the `pprint` function, which is then checked for a specific issue related to formatting. Adjust the `expected_part` string or the condition according to the specific issue details you're expecting to see or not see in the output. The assertion is there to raise an error if the condition indicating the issue is met.

It's worth noting that this script directly checks the pretty print formatting, and adjustments may be needed to match the exact expectations you have regarding the presence or absence of certain formatting elements in the output. This includes tailoring the expected output string in `expected_part` or elsewhere to the precise format you're either hoping to capture as an error or to confirm is not present, depending on the specific issue you're facing with `pprint`.
