        "intended_behavior": "The `replace_with_arrays` method should be updated to allow the `indices` parameter to be optional. This could be achieved by assigning a default value of `None` to `indices` and then implementing a check within the method to handle cases where `indices` is `None`. If `indices` is not provided, the method should either: Use a default ordering based on the keys of `replacement_dict` or the natural order of tensors within the expression being replaced, or proceed without rearranging the resulting array according to specific indices, implying that the output array's shape and ordering are dictated solely by the `replacement_dict` content and the inherent structure of the expression being replaced. This modification ensures that the `replace_with_arrays` method becomes more flexible, allowing users to skip specifying `indices` when it is unnecessary for their use case, while preserving existing functionality when `indices` are provided. The method's documentation should also be updated to explain the new optional nature of `indices` and describe the default behavior when `indices` are not specified."
