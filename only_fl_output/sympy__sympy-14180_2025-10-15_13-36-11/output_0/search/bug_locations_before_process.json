However, ensure that during the reverse conversion (SymPy expressions back to LaTeX), expressions with the natural logarithm base (`sympy.E`) are explicitly converted to `\\ln{}` in LaTeX, not just `log`. This specific adjustment is not discussed within the exact lines provided but inferred as the necessary location for ensuring `\\ln` is used for natural logarithms in LaTeX outputs."
