        "intended_behavior": "Implement a method `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` within the `Max` class that handles the rewriting of `Max` expressions into `Piecewise` format. This method should take the arguments given to the `Max` function, compare them, and create a `Piecewise` expression indicating that it should use the first argument if the condition (first argument > second argument) is true, else use the second argument. This keeps the original functionality by providing an alternative representation of the operation."

        "method": "_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `Max`, implement a method `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` within the `Min` class. This method will handle the rewriting of `Min` expressions into a `Piecewise` structure, which should return the first argument if it's less than the second argument, else return the second argument. This effectively mirrors the function's behavior using a `Piecewise` symbolic representation, ensuring the original semantics are preserved in the new format."
