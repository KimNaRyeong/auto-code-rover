        "intended_behavior": "This file should include a new `cross` function that mimics the structure and approach used by the existing `dot` function but instead employs `numpy.cross` to compute the cross product of two `DataArray` objects. The function should handle input validation (e.g., ensuring that the spatial dimension has a size of 3 for 3D vectors or 2 for 2D vectors), work with dask arrays (using `dask='parallelized'` when applicable), and respect xarray's dimension handling conventions. This new function will extend xarray's computational capabilities to include vector cross products, filling a gap for users working on physical applications requiring such operations."

        "method": "cross",
        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method `cross` to the `DataArray` class. This method would provide a high-level interface to the `cross` function defined in `computation.py`, allowing users to call the cross product operation directly on `DataArray` instances, similar to how they currently use the `dot` method. This method should validate the input and dimensions, similarly ensuring that only suitable `DataArray` objects are passed (e.g., checking that the spatial dimension is correctly sized and exists within the arrays). This extension will make the feature easily accessible to users, integrating seamlessly with the existing API."
