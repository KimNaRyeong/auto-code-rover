This script aims to reproduce an issue related to a feature request for adding a vector cross product function to `xarray` that acts as a wrapper around `numpy.cross`. The `cross` function detailed in the script is meant to be compatible with dask for parallelization, and it checks for the correct dimensionality of its input data arrays. 

The script will produce a stack trace and exit with an error if the issue is present, which in this context primarily revolves around handling exceptions related to improper use of dimensions or data types. It will check for the successful addition of cross product functionality by ensuring that the operation can be performed without raising exceptions and that the output shape is as expected.
