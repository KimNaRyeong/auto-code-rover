It should measure the bounding box of the wrapped text and notify the constrained layout system to allocate adequate vertical space above the topmost Axes to prevent overlapping. This requires preserving the existing functionality for titles without wrapping, ensuring that additional space is only reserved when necessary due to wrapping."

When a title with wrap=True is set, the method needs to dynamically adjust (or suggest adjustments to) the layout, particularly the vertical spacing above the Axes, to accommodate the dimensions of the wrapped title. This involves a mechanism to estimate the height of the title text post-wrap and communicate this to the layout system effectively."

        "intended_behavior": "The core constrained layout logic must be refined to better handle dynamic adjustments required by wrapped text in titles. This would involve improving how the layout engine calculates the necessary space for text elements when wrapping is enabled. Enhancements should ensure that adjustments are only made when necessary (i.e., when wrapped text is present) and that these adjustments are efficient and minimize unnecessary layout recalculations. Otherwise, the intended behavior is to adhere to the principles of the constrained layout system, offering a balanced layout based on the elements present in the figure."
