Given your request for a corrected script that would appropriately reproduce the reported issue and exit correctly based on its presence, please find below an updated version of `reproducer.py`. This updated script better handles the environment setup and error catching, aiming to reliably reproduce the issue with Django's `runserver` not stripping the response body for `HEAD` requests as expected:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import time
import requests
import threading

def run_django_server():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_test.settings')
    subprocess.run(['python', 'manage.py', 'runserver'])

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_head_request():
    response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')
    content_length = response.headers.get('Content-Length', 0)
    if int(content_length) > 0:
        raise AssertionError("HEAD request returned body content")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Checking prerequisites
    if not os.path.isfile('manage.py'):
        print("This script must be run from the root of a Django project where 'manage.py' is located.")
        exit(1)

    # Start server in background thread
    server_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_django_server)
    server_thread.daemon = True
    server_thread.start()
    print("Django server starting...")

    # Allow server some time to start
    time.sleep(5)  # Adjust time as necessary

    try:
        test_head_request()  # Perform the test
        print("Test passed: No issue detected, server behaves as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test failed: Issue detected.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error occurred during the test.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Instructions for Use:**

1. **Project Requirement**: This script assumes it's placed at the root of a Django project (where `manage.py` resides). It attempts to modify the Django environment variable to point to your project's settings module, which you might need to adjust according to your project's configuration.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure Django and Requests are installed in your environment (`pip install Django requests`).

3. **Execution**: Run this script using Python 3 in the root directory of your Django project.

**How It Works**:

- The script starts a Django development server on a background thread using Django's `manage.py runserver`.
- It waits for a few seconds to ensure the server has started.
- Performs an HTTP HEAD request to the root of the server.
- Checks the `Content-Length` header to assert body content length. An error is raised if content is present when it shouldn't be, according to the HTTP specification for HEAD requests.
- Properly handles unexpected errors and prints detailed stack traces for diagnostics.

**Note**:

- The `time.sleep(5)` is a naive way to wait for the server to start. It could be replaced with more sophisticated checks to see if the server is up.
- This script uses the `requests` library for simplicity and readability over `http.client` or similar lower-level libraries.
