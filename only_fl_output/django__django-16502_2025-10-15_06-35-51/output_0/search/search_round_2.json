        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Occurrences of `runserver` in the Django codebase:**\n\n   The search for `\"runserver\"` indicates that the runserver command is defined in multiple files, notably in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` and `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`. This suggests that the main logic for the command and possibly the handling of requests for the development server are located in these files.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - The `runserver` command is crucial for starting Django's development server. Given the issue, our focus should be on how this command sets up the server and how the server handles HTTP HEAD requests.\n   - The relationship between this part of the code and the bug is direct. Since `runserver` initializes the development server, any handling of HTTP requests, including the stripping or inclusion of bodies in HEAD requests, is likely to be governed by the logic within these modules.\n   - The intended behavior, in compliance with RFC 2616 section 4.3, is that responses to HTTP HEAD requests should include headers but no message-body. Any logic within `runserver` or related classes that handles responses should ensure this behavior.\n\n2. **The `WSGIServer` class in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`:**\n\n   The discovery of the `WSGIServer` class extends our understanding of which component might be directly responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses back to clients. The class inherits from `simple_server.WSGIServer`, modifying or extending its functionality for Django's specific needs.\n\n   **Analysis:**\n   - This part of the code sets up the HTTP server for Django's development environment. It includes configurations like the request queue size and possibly error handling specific to Django projects.\n   - The relationship with the bug is critical since the `WSGIServer` is likely the last step in the handling of requests before responses are returned to the client. If this server does not correctly handle HEAD requests by stripping the body, it would directly lead to the reported issue.\n   - The intended behavior here is to ensure that the server complies with HTTP standards for HEAD requests, possibly requiring modifications or overrides to default handling inherited from `simple_server.WSGIServer` to ensure no body is sent.\n\nGiven the findings and initial analysis, we should focus on how the `runserver` command sets up `WSGIServer` and how the server processes requests. Since searches for `finalize_response` and `send_response` in `WSGIServer` did not yield results, we might need to broaden our search to include how requests are handled more generally in Django's server code or look into `WSGIServer`'s parent class or the request handling mechanism it employs. A more generalized search for methods handling HTTP requests or constructing responses within `basehttp.py` or related to `runserver`'s operation seems warranted. \n\nNext steps could include:\n- Searching for how `WSGIServer` handles requests (`handle_request`, `process_request`, etc.) to find where a check for the request method and stripping of the body for HEAD requests might be implemented or should be implemented.\n- Investigating how responses are constructed and sent back to the client, focusing on identifying the point where the distinction between GET and HEAD request processing could be enforced in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py` or other related files."

Typically, such a server would parse the HTTP request to determine its method (GET, HEAD, POST, etc.) and route or handle it accordingly. \n\n2. **Investigate Response Formatting**: Given that the issue specifically involves the handling of HEAD requests, where the response should not include a body, investigating how responses are formatted and sent could reveal where the necessary adjustments are needed.\n\n### Adjusted Context Gathering Plan\n\nGiven the lack of success with the previous search parameters and considering the nature of WSGI servers, we might explore more generally named methods or mechanisms that a WSGI server would use and focus on understanding their implementation:\n\n- **Search for Request Handling**: It's possible that the request handling logic could be part of a more generally named method or handled by the WSGI application itself before being passed down to the server. This could involve middleware or view logic.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code_in_file(\"environ['REQUEST_METHOD']\", \"django/core/servers/basehttp.py\")\n    ```\n\n- **Search for Response Sending Logic**: Since we did not find `send_response`, we should look for how the server writes responses back to the client, which could include headers and body.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code_in_file(\"start_response\", \"django/core/servers/basehttp.py\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches aim to find the mechanism through which Django's development server determines how to handle a request based on its method and how it constructs and sends the response, to identify where adjustments are necessary for HEAD requests."

Since specific method names were not identified, the intended behavior is theoretical but grounded on addressing the described issue.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** A modification or addition is needed to inspect the `REQUEST_METHOD` from the request environment (`environ`). If the method is `HEAD`, the server should proceed to generate a response with headers identical to those it would for a `GET` request but without including a body in the response. This ensures compliance with HTTP standards for HEAD requests.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n  - **Class/Method:** The section of code responsible for sending the response back to the client. This could involve calling `start_response` and sending the response body.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure this logic checks if the response is to a HEAD request. If so, regardless of the body content prepared, not send any body content but only headers. This might involve adjusting how the response body is constructed or omitted based on the request method.\n\nThese are the theorized necessary fixes based on analyzing the described issue and understanding of typical WSGI application behavior. Without direct evidence of where Django's development server handles these specific parts of the request/response cycle, these suggestions aim to guide the investigation towards ensuring compliance with the reported standards and resolving the reported issue."
