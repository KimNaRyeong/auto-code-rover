This could include custom configurations in `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`, or explicit setup code that modifies `pytest` or `doctest` behavior.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"pytest.ini\")\nsearch_code(\"conftest.py\")\n```\n\n3. **Inspect doctest integration**: Since the traceback references the `doctest` module's involvement and an attempt to unwrap a function, understanding how doctests are written or configured in the project could provide insights. Particularly, looking at how tests, likely doctests, are organized might shed light on where the integration with the `sty` module could be causing issues.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"@doctest\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to gather relevant context about the import and usage of `sty`, the configuration and setup of `pytest` within the project, and how doctests are utilized, giving us a clearer picture of what might be causing the KeyError."

        "content": "Given the provided results and the nature of the issue described, we have a few key areas to focus on, and considering the questions above, we can deduce the next steps to investigate the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` issue further.\n\n### Analysis of Current Findings\n\n1. **Result of `search_code(\"from sty import\")`:**  \n   - **What does this part of the code do?** This search was supposed to find occurrences of importing `sty`, which might be related to the reported `KeyError`. The absence of results suggests that the direct import of `sty` in an obvious manner might not exist or the search may not cover the exact scope or way `sty` is imported.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** Since the import seems to trigger the issue based on the issue description, not finding it directly means we might need to look into indirect imports or configurations that might be pulling in `sty`, perhaps through plugins or dynamic imports.\n   - **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** Ideally, `sty` would be imported without causing a `KeyError`. It points towards investigating how `pytest` and its plugins or extensions might interact with `sty`, rather than direct usage in the code.\n\n2. **Results of `search_code(\"pytest.ini\")` and `search_code(\"conftest.py\")`:**\n   - These configurations and setup files are central to how `pytest` operates, including plugin management, test collection, and environment setup. Understanding their content can shed light on potential custom configurations that might affect how imports are handled or how doctest discovery is done.\n   - **Relationship and Intended Behavior:** Given the KeyError during test collection, it's plausible that custom configurations might either interfere with how objects are wrapped/unwrapped or affect the environment in which tests run. The intended behavior here would involve these configurations allowing for smooth test collection without causing exceptions due to import mishandlings or misconfigurations.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context:\n\nGiven the current findings and their analysis:\n\n1. **Investigate `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py` configurations**: Since these files evidently configure test collections and environments, it's prudent to inspect their contents for any unusual configurations that might affect the handling of imports or the integration with `sty`.\n   \n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"pytest.ini\", \"testing/test_config.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"conftest.py\", \"testing/test_conftest.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Inspect pytest and plugin integrations or customizations**: Given the interaction with `doctest` and potential custom test collection or environment setup, looking into how `pytest` plugins or custom code might dynamically interact with imports can provide insights. This might involve how fixtures are used or any dynamic import logic that might indirectly involve `sty`.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"plugin\")\nsearch_code(\"import\")\n```\n\nThese directions aim to uncover the problematic configurations or code segments that lead to the `KeyError`, focusing on configurations, dynamic imports, or indirect usages of `sty` through `pytest`'s mechanisms, which were not immediately obvious from the initial search results."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Without direct access to specific code snippets or files showing how `pytest`, `tox`, or `sty` are configured or integrated within the project beyond the search results provided, accurately pinpointing the bug locations and describing the intended behavior is speculative. However, based on common issues that lead to a `KeyError` of `__wrapped__` in the context of Python testing frameworks, I can suggest a general direction for resolution:\n\n**General Bug Location and Intended Behavior**:  \n- **Buggy File**: The issue likely resides within configuration files (`pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`) or potentially within a custom plugin or setup module that overlaps with the `pytest` or `tox` execution path. Since we lack specific file paths beyond the directories indicated in the search results, a precise file cannot be named.\n- **Intended Behavior**:\n  - The code within these potential locations should safely import modules or handle imports in a way that doesn't intrude on the normal operation of `doctest` or `pytest`'s wrapping/unwrapping mechanisms. This could involve:\n    - Ensuring that any dynamic imports are done in a way that doesn't conflict with the wrapped objects or functions that `pytest` or other libraries might use for their internal processing.\n    - Checking and possibly refactoring the use of decorators or meta-programming techniques that might obscure the visibility or alter the expected structure of objects, particularly those related to the test collection phase.\n    - If a custom plugin or extension for `pytest` is involved, verifying that it properly uses the plugin hooks and adheres to the contracts expected by `pytest`, particularly around test collection, fixture setup, and teardown.\n\nWithout specific code, it's challenging to offer a precise fix. However, considering the error involves the `__wrapped__` attribute, reviewing and potentially refactoring how libraries are imported or how objects/functions are decorated or modified during test collection could resolve the issue. Attention should be focused on maintaining existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with the test framework's expectations about object structure and lifecycle."
