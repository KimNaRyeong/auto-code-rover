If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `makemigrations.py` Code Snippet\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   The excerpt from `makemigrations.py` shows the part of the `handle` method of the `Command` class responsible for checking migration history consistency across different database aliases. It creates a `MigrationLoader` instance, determines the databases to check based on the existence of database routers, and for each database alias, it checks if at least one model is allowed to migrate. If so, it calls the `loader.check_consistent_history` method to ensure that all applied migrations do not have unapplied dependencies.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n   \n   This part of the code is directly related to the described issue. The issue is with the requirement for an active database connection to run `makemigrations` due to the call to `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)`, which verifies the consistency of migration history. The problem occurs when the database is not accessible or set up, causing this check to fail and thereby preventing `makemigrations` from executing further.\n\n3. **Intended behavior based on the issue description**\n   \n   Ideally, given the issue description, this part of the code should optionally skip the migration history consistency check (`loader.check_consistent_history`) when a specific flag is provided to the command. This modification would allow `makemigrations` to proceed without requiring a database connection for situations where the developer is aware that the consistency check can be bypassed safely.\n\n#### `MigrationLoader.check_consistent_history` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   The `check_consistent_history` method in `MigrationLoader` raises an `InconsistentMigrationHistory` exception if there are any applied migrations with unapplied dependencies. It goes through each applied migration, identified using a `MigrationRecorder`, and checks this migration against the migration graph maintained by the loader. If it finds any dependencies (parents) of the applied migration that are not applied, it raises the exception, indicating an inconsistency.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n   \n   This method is the core of the consistency check that the issue aims to conditionally bypass. The method does not currently provide a mechanism to skip or handle the absence of a database connection gracefully, which is the crux of the problem presented in the issue.\n\n3. **Intended behavior based on the issue description**\n   \n   To address the issue, there might need to be an additional parameter or condition within this method (or at its invocation point) to control whether this consistency check should be performed. This new logic would need to consider a flag passed from the `makemigrations` command, allowing the operation to continue without raising an exception due to database connectivity issues.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nConsidering the current findings, a solution would involve modifying the invocation of the `check_consistent_history` method in `makemigrations.py` to conditionally skip this call based on a new command-line flag. Not only this call but also the logic leading up to this call may need to be adjusted to ensure that the absence of a database connection does not halt the process. Additionally, it may be beneficial to implement graceful handling or skipping of the check inside the `check_consistent_history` method itself, based on the passed condition. \n\nThe next step in crafting a solution would likely involve planning these modifications and ensuring any new flag is adequately parsed and used within the `makemigrations` command."

The command's `handle` method should conditionally execute this consistency check based on the presence of the new flag. If the flag is set to true, the method should skip the consistency check and proceed with the rest of the `makemigrations` process. This change preserves the default functionality (performing the check) while providing an override for cases where a database connection is not available or not required for the migrations being created.\n\n- **Location 2**\n  - **File:** `django/db/migrations/loader.py`\n  - **Class:** `MigrationLoader`\n  - **Method:** `check_consistent_history`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Although the primary solution may not require changes to this method directly, consideration should be given to whether an internal mechanism for handling or logging the bypass of this check when the `--skip-db-check` flag is used is appropriate. This might involve accepting an additional parameter that indicates the check is being skipped and then conditionally performing the check or cleanly bypassing it. If a change here is deemed unnecessary based on the `makemigrations` command's adjustments, this method can remain as it is.\n\nThe main change is focused on adding functionality to the `makemigrations` command to allow bypassing the database checks, offering flexibility for developers working in environments where the database is not accessible. This approach ensures that the developer is consciously opting into this behavior, with the system defaulting to the safer option of performing all checks."
