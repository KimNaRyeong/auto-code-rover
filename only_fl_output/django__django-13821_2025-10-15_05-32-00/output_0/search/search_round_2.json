        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 effectively, we need to gather context about how the project currently determines and utilizes the SQLite version. Specifically, we need to look for code that checks the SQLite version and possibly code that takes advantage of features specific to SQLite 3.9.0 and above. Given the nature of the issue related to database functionality and version checking, we are likely looking at initialization code or utilities that interact with the database.\n\nFirst, let's identify if there's a centralized way the project currently checks the SQLite version. This process typically involves checking against a version string or using a feature check that indirectly determines version capability.\n\n1. **Search for version check logic**:\n   - Search for a method or a code snippet that might be responsible for checking the SQLite version. This includes direct version string comparisons or feature checks that distinguish between SQLite versions.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite version check\")\nsearch_code(\"3.9.0\")\n```\n\n2. **Identify features specific to SQLite >= 3.9.0**:\n   - Since the issue mentions indexes on expressions and the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option as features requiring SQLite 3.9.0+, it makes sense to look for their usage within the project. This will help in understanding how these features are integrated and possibly hint at how the version check is implemented.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"indexes on expressions\")\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of how SQLite versioning is currently handled in the project, including any direct references to the 3.9.0 version or specific features available from that version onwards. This context is essential for updating the project to drop support for older SQLite versions effectively."

This could mean several things:\n- The project may implicitly support certain SQLite versions based on the features used or the environments it's targeted to run in, without specific checks.\n- The version compliance may be ensured through documentation or external dependencies rather than coded checks.\n- The SQLite version might be checked in a more generic way, not specifically looking for \"3.9.0\" or the mentioned features.\n\nGiven this, we should explore alternative avenues to understand how the project interfaces with SQLite, which could lead us to how it might enforce or check version compatibility.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can observe several key areas in the codebase where SQLite is referenced, indicating where version support might be relevant and thus where adjustments may need to be made in response to the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions less than 3.9.0.\n\n### Analyzed Context:\n\n1. **References to SQLite in Various Files:**\n   - The code snippets found within files related to SQLite, such as `features.py`, `creation.py`, `base.py`, `operations.py`, `introspection.py`, `schema.py`, and more, suggest these are areas where database features specific to SQLite are managed. This likely includes how Django interacts with the SQLite database, defines its capabilities, and possibly where it checks for features available in specific SQLite versions.\n\n2. **Usage of Database Version Information:**\n   - The snippet from `django/contrib/gis/db/backends/base/operations.py` doesn't directly reference SQLite version checking but shows a pattern of how database versioning might be handled or considered in the context of geo-spatial operations. This pattern may be mirrored or applicable in how SQLite versions are accounted for.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Code's Functionality:**\n   - The mentioned files and their snippets are primarily concerned with defining and utilizing SQLite-specific features. These might include defining what features are available (such as JSON1), how database schema operations are handled, and how queries are constructed and executed specific to SQLite's capabilities.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Issue:**\n   - Since the issue involves dropping support for certain SQLite versions, the locations highlighted are crucial. They potentially contain logic that either assumes or directly checks for the availability of features introduced in SQLite 3.9.0 or later. For instance, support for indexes on expressions or using the JSON1 extension could be critical areas of focus.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior in Light of the Issue:**\n   - The intended behavior post-change would involve ensuring that the project no longer allows the usage of SQLite versions less than 3.9.0. This could mean introducing explicit version checks that prevent older versions from being used, removing fallbacks or alternative implementations that were meant to support versions older than 3.9.0, and updating documentation or errors to reflect the new minimum version requirement.\n\nGiven this analysis, we need to locate where the project might check for SQLite version compatibility or where it implicitly depends on features available in versions 3.9.0 and later. To do this effectively, examining the specifics of how features like JSON1 are used or where expression indexes might be defined could provide clues. Moreover, inspecting the initialization and configuration logic in `base.py` and `features.py` of the SQLite backend could reveal if version checks are performed or needed according to the new requirements.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering:\n\nTo further refine our understanding and directly address the issue, the next steps could involve:\n\n- **Inspecting Specific Files for Version Handling Logic:**\n  - Direct inspection of files like `features.py`, `base.py`, or similar, where conditional logic based on SQLite version might exist or need to be introduced.\n\n- **Understanding Feature Utilization:**\n  - Reviewing how and where specific SQLite features that require version 3.9.0 or later are used within these files to ensure compatibility and enforce the new version requirement."

Further context is not needed from search API calls at this stage due to a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished based on the provided search results and the issue description.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n1. **Location 1:**\n   - **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** Potential addition or modification within this file to explicitly define features supported from SQLite 3.9.0 onwards.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Update or introduce feature flags that are only available in SQLite 3.9.0 and later, such as support for `indexes on expressions` and the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` option. Ensure that usage of these features within the Django project is conditioned on the availability of these version-specific flags.\n\n2. **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** Look for or add a method or logic within the database connection initialization that checks the version of SQLite at runtime.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Introduce a runtime check during the database connection initialization phase that ensures the SQLite version is at least 3.9.0. If the version is lower, raise an appropriate exception informing the user of the unsupported version. This ensures the application does not run on unsupported versions of SQLite, adhering to the new requirements.\n\nThese locations are identified as potential points where the project interacts with SQLite in a way that could require ensuring compatibility with or taking advantage of features introduced in SQLite version 3.9.0 or later.
