Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 effectively, we need to gather context about how the project currently determines and utilizes the SQLite version. Specifically, we need to look for code that checks the SQLite version and possibly code that takes advantage of features specific to SQLite 3.9.0 and above. Given the nature of the issue related to database functionality and version checking, we are likely looking at initialization code or utilities that interact with the database.\n\nFirst, let's identify if there's a centralized way the project currently checks the SQLite version. This process typically involves checking against a version string or using a feature check that indirectly determines version capability.\n\n1. **Search for version check logic**:\n   - Search for a method or a code snippet that might be responsible for checking the SQLite version. This includes direct version string comparisons or feature checks that distinguish between SQLite versions.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite version check\")\nsearch_code(\"3.9.0\")\n```\n\n2. **Identify features specific to SQLite >= 3.9.0**:\n   - Since the issue mentions indexes on expressions and the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option as features requiring SQLite 3.9.0+, it makes sense to look for their usage within the project. This will help in understanding how these features are integrated and possibly hint at how the version check is implemented.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"indexes on expressions\")\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of how SQLite versioning is currently handled in the project, including any direct references to the 3.9.0 version or specific features available from that version onwards. This context is essential for updating the project to drop support for older SQLite versions effectively."
