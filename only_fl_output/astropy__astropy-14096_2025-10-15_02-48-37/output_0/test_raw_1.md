Given the details and the requirements for a revised `reproducer.py` script that effectively reproduces the reported problem, and taking into account the feedback from the previous attempt, a possible reiteration for the script would explicitly check for the correct exception message. The script would need adjustments to properly reflect the expectation and handle the environment's specific error related to missing modules or packages gracefully. However, since the error you encountered seems to pertain to your testing environment (missing `packaging` module), the reproduction script itself wouldn't directly resolve that, but it's focused on the issue at hand regarding attribute access in subclassed objects:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import astropy.coordinates as coord

    class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
        @property
        def prop(self):
            return self.random_attr

    c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
    # Accessing the custom property to trigger the error
    c.prop

except AttributeError as e:
    # Comparing the exception message to what is expected
    if "has no attribute 'random_attr'" in str(e):
        print("The issue has not been fixed yet.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error message.") from e
else:
    print("Issue appears to be fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

Regarding your environment error (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging'`), it seems the Python environment where the script is being executed lacks the `packaging` module, which is a dependency of `astropy`. You might need to ensure all dependencies are installed, including `packaging`, possibly by running `pip install packaging` or ensuring your environment is properly set up to include all necessary `astropy` dependencies.
