Specifically, for inputs like `polylog(2, Rational(1,2))`, the function should expand to `-log(2)**2/2 + pi**2/12`, as mathematically expected. This change should maintain existing functionality while correcting the expansion logic to handle known identities correctly, especially in simplification or expansion scenarios."

        "intended_behavior": "The `expand_func` method needs refinements in its interaction with the `polylog` function to ensure it correctly applies expansion rules and recognizes the need for specific expansions based on `polylog` expressions. It should be capable of identifying and applying the correct mathematical expansions for `polylog` function expressions, ensuring that cases like `polylog(2, Rational(1,2))` are expanded correctly to `-log(2)**2/2 + pi**2/12`. The update should preserve `expand_func`'s general functionality across all expressions while providing a targeted fix or enhancement for `polylog` expansion scenarios."
