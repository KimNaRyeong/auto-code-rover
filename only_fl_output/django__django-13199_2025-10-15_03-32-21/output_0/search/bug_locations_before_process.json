        "intended_behavior": "The `delete_cookie` method should be enhanced to ensure it also considers the `SameSite` attribute of the cookie being deleted. Given the description and the necessity to comply with modern browser requirements for cookies, the method should allow specifying a `SameSite` value when deleting a cookie. If a `SameSite` value is not explicitly provided, it should default to using the value specified in `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE`. This change ensures that when cookies are set to be deleted (by setting their expiration date in the past), they still comply with browser expectations regarding the `SameSite` and `Secure` attributes, minimizing the risk of cookies being rejected by browsers due to missing or incorrect attributes. The behavior should preserve the cookie's `Secure` attribute based on the global settings or the cookie's key prefix, aligning with current practices, but add the handling for `SameSite` to ensure full compatibility and security compliance."
