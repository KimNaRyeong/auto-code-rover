Fetching the code around this line will provide context on how `wspace` and `hspace` are supposed to be used according to the expected outcome linked in the issue. \n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the problem area within the matplotlib codebase, allowing for an informed approach to crafting a patch."
