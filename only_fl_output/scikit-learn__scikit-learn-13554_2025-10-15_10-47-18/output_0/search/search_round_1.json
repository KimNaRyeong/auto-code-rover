        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit. In other words, I expect the following output:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\nThe code snippet above produces the following output for me:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.03125]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nDarwin-16.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n('Python', '2.7.11 | 64-bit | (default, Jun 11 2016, 03:41:56) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]')\n('NumPy', '1.11.3')\n('SciPy', '0.19.0')\n('Scikit-Learn', '0.18.1')\n```\n[WIP] Stable and fast float32 implementation of euclidean_distances\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\nFixes #9354\nSuperseds PR #10069\n#### What does this implement/fix?

This is done useing only a fixed amount of additional (temporary) memory.\n#### Any other comments?\nThis code implements several optimizations:\n* since the distance matrix is symmetric when `X is Y`, copy the blocks of the upper triangle to the lower triangle;\n* compute the optimal block size that would use most of the allowed additional memory;\n* cast blocks of `{X,Y}_norm_squared` to float64;\n* precompute blocks of `X_norm_squared` if not given so it gets reused through the iterations over `Y`;\n* swap `X` and `Y` when `X_norm_squared` is given, but not `Y_norm_squared`.\nNote that all the optimizations listed here have proven useful in a benchmark. The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "content": "The search results provided crucial insights into the implementation of the `pairwise_distances` function in Scikit-Learn, but also revealed gaps in the search for specific optimization strategies mentioned in the issue description. Let's analyze the given context and consider subsequent steps:\n\n### Analysis of `pairwise_distances` Implementation:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `pairwise_distances` function computes the distance matrix from a vector array `X` and an optional vector array `Y`, using a specified metric. It supports a wide range of metrics, both from Scikit-Learn itself and from `scipy.spatial.distance`. For some metrics like 'euclidean', 'cityblock', and 'cosine', Scikit-Learn's implementation is preferred over SciPy's due to optimizations for speed and sparse matrix support. The function can also handle precomputed distance matrices directly.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - The bug issue is specifically related to the numeric precision of the `euclidean` distance computation using `float32` arrays, where the output from `pairwise_distances` disagrees with NumPy's `np.linalg.norm` method. The `pairwise_distances` function delegates the computation to different implementations based on the nature of the input and the specified metric. For the `euclidean` metric, it employs optimized implementations that might handle `float32` and `float64` data types differently, leading to discrepancies in numeric precision.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Ideally, `pairwise_distances` should provide consistent results with NumPy's distance computations, irrespective of the data types (`float32` or `float64`). The fact that results align for `float64` but not for `float32` indicates a potential precision handling or type conversion issue within the implementation when dealing with lower precision floating-point numbers.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Gaps in Search:\n\n1. **Investigating Specific Optimizations:**\n   - The issue mentions optimizations, including block-wise casting to `float64`, handling additional memory, and manipulating blocks of the distance matrix, which were not found in the search results. Since the direct search for these optimizations returned no results, it might be due to them being described in a more abstract way or implemented differently than literal \"block-wise casting to float64\".\n\n2. **Alternative Search Approaches:**\n   - Considering the optimizations were not directly found, we could look for related functionality that implies such optimizations. This includes looking into where the library handles data types, particularly the conversion between `float32` and `float64`, or memory management aspects during the computation of distances.\n   \n3. **Exploring Related Functions or Utilities:**\n   - The bug might lie in utility functions or preprocessing steps before the actual distance computation occurs in `pairwise_distances`. Since the implementation delegates to `PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS` for known metrics, and there's mentioning of `_precompute_metric_params` and `_parallel_pairwise`, examining these areas can reveal handling of data types or optimizations intended to improve performance or memory usage.\n\n4. **Further API Calls:**\n   - To understand how the data types are handled or converted during the process, we should look more into:\n     - `search_method(\"_precompute_metric_params\")`\n     - `search_method(\"_parallel_pairwise\")`\n     - Alternatively, finding calls to NumPy's `astype` method might reveal explicit casts: `search_code(\"astype\")`\n\nBy framing further inquiries around these points, we aim to uncover the internal workings that could influence the numerical precision of euclidean distances computed for `float32` arrays in Scikit-Learn."

However, based on the given information and understanding of how `pairwise_distances` should work, a hypothetical location can be inferred:\n     - **Location 1:**\n       - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n       - **Method:** `pairwise_distances`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior here is to ensure that when computing distances, particularly with the `euclidean` metric, the function should handle `float32` data types in a manner that preserves numerical precision to match `np.linalg.norm`. This could involve ensuring any type conversion (to `float64` for intermediate calculations to enhance precision) and subsequent conversion back to `float32`, if done, does not introduce errors or discrepancies as observed. Additionally, if memory optimization techniques like block-wise processing are employed, they must not compromise the accuracy of the distance computations.\n\nWithout specific insights into how Scikit-Learn's optimizations and type handling might lead to the observed discrepancy, these locations and behaviors are speculative and meant to guide further investigation once additional context is acquired."
