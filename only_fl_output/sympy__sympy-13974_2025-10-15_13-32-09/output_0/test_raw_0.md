This script aims to detect if there is an issue with the evaluation of powers of tensor product expressions in SymPy. It reproduces the specific issue reported and will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, printing a detailed stack trace. If the issue is fixed, it should exit with code 0 after printing "All tests passed."
