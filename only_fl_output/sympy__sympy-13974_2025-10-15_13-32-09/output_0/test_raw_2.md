To meet your request for a Python script that raises an `AssertionError` if it encounters the described issue and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed, the script below is crafted to test the problematic behavior with tensor products, specifically with their powers and simplification using SymPy. 

It incorporates the provided function `print_stacktrace` to enhance error reporting. Following your description, the script will:

1. Attempt to simplify tensor products and their powers.
2. Compare the output against the expected simplified form (if applicable or the lack thereof which indicates the issue).
3. Raise an `AssertionError` if the simplification does not occur as expected (indicating the presence of the issue).
4. Catch the `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

I have adjusted the approach to align with your corrected understanding:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, expand
    from sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct as tp
    from sympy.physics.quantum import tensor_product_simp as tps
    from sympy.physics.paulialgebra import Pauli

    a = Symbol('a', commutative=False)

    # Attempt operations that should trigger an issue
    t1 = tp(1, 1) * tp(1, 1)
    t2 = tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, Pauli(3))

    try:
        # Apply simplification function
        simplified_t1 = tps(t1)
        simplified_t2 = tps(t2)

        # Check if the simplification matches the expected output
        # The issue is present if there is no change (i.e., no simplification occurred)
        assert str(simplified_t1) != "1x1**2", "t1 simplification issue present."
        assert str(simplified_t2) != "1xsigma3**2", "t2 simplification issue present."
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero indicating failure

    print("No issue found, simplification works as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script precisely aims to check for issues specifically related to the `TensorProduct` powers and their simplification as indicated in your description.
