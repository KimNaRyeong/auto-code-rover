Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

These calls will focus on identifying the parts of the codebase responsible for link checking, handling redirects, and possibly storing or validating URL pairs.\n\n1. **Search for a link checker class**: This class likely contains the logic for checking links and handling redirects.\n   - `search_class(\"LinkChecker\")`\n\n2. **Search for a method related to handling redirects**: This method(s) would be involved in the process of handling redirects during the link checking process.\n   - `search_method(\"handleRedirect\")`\n\n3. **Search for method to configure allowed redirects**: If there's already a mechanism to configure rules or parameters for the link checker, it would be useful to know how it's implemented.\n   - `search_method(\"configureAllowedRedirects\")`\n   \n4. **Search for code related to parsing or processing redirects**: This might provide insight into how redirects are currently handled and where modifications are needed.\n   - `search_code(\"parseRedirect\")`\n   - `search_code(\"processRedirect\")`\n\nThese searches are designed to find the parts of the codebase that are most relevant to the issue, such as where redirects are handled and how to potentially enforce rules about which redirects are allowed. The output of these calls will help in understanding how the current system works and where the new functionality can be integrated."
