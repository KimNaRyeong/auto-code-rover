        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to examine the code mentioned in the bug report and potentially any related surrounding code or methods. The issue mentions a specific line in a specific file `xarray/core/nanops.py` and a potential solution. Let's focus on the following actions:\n\n1. Examine the specific method or code snippet around the mentioned URL to understand how the current `sum` operation is implemented with regards to `min_count`, as well as its location in the `nanops.py` file.\n2. Since the issue describes a problem when passing more than one dimension to `sum` with `min_count`, we may need to look at how dimensions are processed in the `sum` method or related functions.\n\nTherefore, the necessary steps with API calls could be:\n\n- Retrieve and examine the code around the mentioned line in `nanops.py` to see the current handling.\n- Look for the `sum` method implementation in case it's in another part of the file or in another closely related file, understanding its interaction with `nanops.py` might also require additional context on method calls to `nanops` functions.\n\nLet's execute the API calls:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/nanops.py\", 35, 10)` to get the surrounding context of the suggested modification line.\n- `search_method(\"sum\")` to find definitions of `sum` method that might be using this logic for handling `min_count`."
