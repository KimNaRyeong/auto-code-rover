Given the context of the issue with numpy not being found, it seems there was a problem with your testing environment rather than the script itself. Ensure that numpy is installed in your Python environment. You can install numpy via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

or using conda, if you prefer:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

Below is a revised version of the script adhering to your requirements that incorporates the given function to print a stack trace. This script assumes that the testing environment now has numpy installed and will attempt to reproduce the described issue. If the issue occurs, it will print a detailed stack trace. Otherwise, it will exit with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_autowrap_cython_backend_with_unused_array_args():
    from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    import numpy as np
    
    x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
    expr = 1.0
    try:
        f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')
        result = f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
        assert isinstance(result, (float, int)), "Expected a scalar result."
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Autowrap with cython backend failed due to a TypeError.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_autowrap_cython_backend_with_unused_array_args()
```

Please ensure numpy is installed in your testing environment before executing the script. This script is designed to exit gracefully with code 0 if the issue is fixed or to provide a clear stack trace explaining the exception encountered due to the issue.
