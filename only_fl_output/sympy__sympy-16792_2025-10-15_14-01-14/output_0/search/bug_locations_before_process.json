        "intended_behavior": "The code within `CythonCodeWrapper`, specifically in the method that handles or influences the generation of the function signature for Cython, needs to ensure that array arguments are correctly recognized and treated as such in the generated code. Even if an array argument (`x` in the issue description) is not used directly in the output expression, it should still be declared appropriately in the function signature (e.g., as `double* x` or a similar correct type for arrays) in the generated Cython code. This behavior is essential for enabling correct interfacing with external libraries and use cases where the function signature is dictated by external constraints, yet some arguments might not be involved in computing the function's return value.\nThe correction should maintain the existing functionality for all current use cases where the arguments are used in expressions. It should only extend the functionality to correctly handle scenarios where array arguments are present but unused. This might involve adding logic to check if an argument is an array (or MatrixSymbol in SymPy terms) and ensuring this is reflected in how the argument is declared in the generated code, without altering the handling of cases already correctly managed."
