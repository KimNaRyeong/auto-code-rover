        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, I will invoke a series of API calls that target the key components and methods mentioned in the issue description. These calls aim to gather context about the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, and the `get_response_async` method, as well as any relevant code snippets that could clarify their implementations and relationships.\n\n1. Let's begin by searching for the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class to understand its current implementation:\n   - `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`\n\n2. Next, we'll look for the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` to understand what methods it contains and possibly why `get_response_async` is missing:\n   - `search_class(\"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`\n\n3. It's also crucial to examine the `get_response_async` method since the traceback indicates that calling this method leads to an exception. We need to understand how and where this method is defined. Since we are not sure about the specific location, let's search across the project:\n   - `search_method(\"get_response_async\")`\n\n4. To get more detailed context around the exception thrown (\"'NoneType' object is not callable\"), it would be helpful to inspect the invocation of `get_response_async` within the `asgi.py` file, as the traceback suggests it's being called there:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"await self.get_response_async(request)\", \"django/core/handlers/asgi.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of how `get_response_async` is implemented or expected to be used within `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, and where potential modifications might be needed to resolve the issue."
