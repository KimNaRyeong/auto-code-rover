        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `get_response_async` method within the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class. This method should: Asynchronously handle requests for static files, ensuring compatibility with Django's ASGI application architecture. Stream static files to the client in an efficient manner, utilizing Django's streaming capabilities similar to what is suggested by the `chunk_bytes` mechanism in `ASGIHandler`. This involves reading and transmitting static files in chunks without loading the entire file into memory, adhering to async IO principles. Properly manage exceptions and errors, including not found errors or server errors, and generate appropriate ASGI responses. Ensure that it follows security practices like validating paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. By implementing the `get_response_async` method as described, `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` would be able to process static file requests asynchronously, thereby closing the gap currently leading to the `'NoneType' object is not callable` exception and aligning the static files serving functionality with Django's ASGI support framework."
