To reproduce the initial issue described, ensure you have a Django project setup as outlined with models for `Author` and `Book`. Both models should implement natural keys and have a fixture file named `books.json` containing the data as described. The Django project should also have at least two databases configured in `settings.py` where `"default"` is one and `"other"` is the name of a second database to test the issue against. 

This script when run, attempts to load a fixture into a non-default database and asserts that the data is correctly loaded by counting records from the `Author` and `Book` models. If the `loaddata` command fails due to an issue with handling natural keys that utilize foreign keys on a non-default database, it should raise an `AssertionError` after printing a stack trace of the issue. The script exits with code 0 when no issues are encountered, indicating a potential fix to the initial problem.
