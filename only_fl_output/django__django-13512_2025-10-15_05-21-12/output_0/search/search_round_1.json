Given the mention of a pull request to the `django-mysql` repo, it suggests the changes or relevant code might be located in files that deal with JSONField serialization or admin display functionality for models involving JSONFields.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be beneficial for understanding the problem and potentially finding where the solution has been applied:\n\n1.

This will help identify where the ASCII encoding issue may originate from.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"json.dumps\")\n   ```\n\n2.

Therefore, we should look for any customizations or monkey patches applied to the Django admin related to `JsonField`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"JsonField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the admin does not display unicode characters properly, it might be helpful to search for code that is specifically related to how fields are rendered or displayed in the Django admin interface.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"admin.ModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n4.

While we can't directly search a third-party repository's pull requests, we can look for potential integration points or customizations within the Django project that may involve `django-mysql`.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"django-mysql\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering a broad context around the serialization of JSON fields, how they are handled within Django admin, and any potential third-party library (`django-mysql`) integrations that may influence the behavior described in the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls provides a detailed overview of where `json.dumps` is used within the Django codebase and some insights into Django's admin functionalities. Let's break down the results:\n\n### Analysis of `json.dumps` Usage\n\n- The `json.dumps` function is found in various parts of the Django codebase, including response handling, form fields, database backends, and more specifically, within `django/db/models/fields/json.py`. This indicates that Django extensively uses `json.dumps` for serializing data into JSON strings.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n- The issue mentioned that `json.dumps` uses ASCII encoding by default, causing Unicode characters (like Chinese) to be represented as ASCII character sequences. The direct mention of `django/db/models/fields/json.py` hints at where the encoding behavior for JSONFields might be customizable or problematic due to this ASCII default.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n- Ideally, when Django serializes data using `json.dumps` for JSONFields, it should allow for non-ASCII characters (like Chinese) to be properly displayed, avoiding the escape to ASCII character sequences.\n\n### Analysis of Django Admin and `JsonField` Non-Finding\n\n- `search_class(\"JsonField\")` did not return any result, which might be because `JsonField` is not directly defined as a class in a straightforward way that the search API could detect, or it's part of Django's third-party packages like `django-mysql` which was not found in the search.\n\n#### Next Steps\n- Considering `django/db/models/fields/json.py` contains references to `json.dumps`, diving deeper into this file might provide insights into how Django's `JsonField` handles encoding and possibly where the problem can be addressed.\n\n- Since direct references to `django-mysql` were not found, and no class definition for `JsonField` was retrieved, it's likely that addressing the issue might involve either contributing to or overriding behaviors found in `django/db/models/fields/json.py`.\n\n### Analysis of `admin.ModelAdmin` Usage\n\n- Django's model admin (`admin.ModelAdmin`) is extended for various applications within Django contrib applications, indicating that customization of admin interfaces is common and well-supported.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n- The bug pertains to how Django admin displays Unicode characters in `JsonField`. Although `admin.ModelAdmin` search did not directly hit on the problem's hot spot, it signifies areas where admin views are customized, hinting at potential spots for further customizations to address Unicode display issues.\n\n### Proposed Next Steps in Investigation\n\n1. **Dive into `django/db/models/fields/json.py`**: Given this file's direct relation to `json.dumps` and JSONField handling, obtaining the code and understanding its serialization process could reveal how to ensure Unicode characters are properly encoded and displayed.\n\n2. **Investigate Custom Admin Handling**: \n    - Since `admin.ModelAdmin` customization is prevalent, understanding how Django admin renders JsonField in these custom admin pages might offer clues. Specifically, it might be useful to search for `JsonField` usage within admin files:\n      ```\n      search_code_in_file(\"JsonField\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")\n      search_code_in_file(\"JsonField\", \"django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\")\n      ```\n\nBy analyzing these points and obtaining more detailed code, especially from `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, we can move closer to identifying a specific location for the bug and consequently, drafting a targeted patch to resolve the issue."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The default behavior of `json.dumps` is to escape non-ASCII characters, which results in the ASCII representation. To address the issue, ensure the serialization uses `ensure_ascii=False` argument with `json.dumps` to allow Unicode characters to be encoded and displayed correctly. This change should preserve all existing functionalities of JSONField serialization and deserialization in Django but enhance it to properly handle and display Unicode characters in Django admin.\n\n**Rationale for Choosing This Location:**\nThe decision to target `django/db/models/fields/json.py` is based on the issue description mentioning the problem arises with Django's handling of JSONFields, especially regarding Unicode (e.g., Chinese characters) representation. Since `json.dumps` is used for serialization, adding `ensure_ascii=False` where `json.dumps` is invoked for JSONFields can potentially resolve the display issue in the Django admin without impacting the broader serialization mechanisms across Django."
