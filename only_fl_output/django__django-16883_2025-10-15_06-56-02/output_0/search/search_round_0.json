        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue about allowing to override the \"table to model conversion\" in `inspectdb` command, we need to understand the current implementation of `inspectdb` and specifically look into where and how table names are currently being converted into model names. Since the proposal mentions a public method for column names, but we are interested in the table name to model name conversion, we need to locate the related method or logic within the `inspectdb` command implementation.\n\nGiven this, the needed API calls are:\n\n1. **Search for the `inspectdb` command class in the entire codebase**: This will give us the file where this command is implemented.\n   `search_class(class_name=\"inspectdb.Command\")`\n\n2. **Search for the method or code snippet in `inspectdb.py` that handles table name to model conversion**: This is based on the assumption that table name conversion to model name logic is situated in the `inspectdb.py` file, but the specific method name is not provided.\n   `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"table name to model\", file_path=\"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with a good starting point to understand how `inspectdb` command handles table names currently and how we might allow users to override this logic."
