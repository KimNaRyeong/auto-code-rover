Since the proposal mentions a public method for column names, but we are interested in the table name to model name conversion, we need to locate the related method or logic within the `inspectdb` command implementation.\n\nGiven this, the needed API calls are:\n\n1. **Search for the `inspectdb` command class in the entire codebase**: This will give us the file where this command is implemented.\n   `search_class(class_name=\"inspectdb.Command\")`\n\n2. **Search for the method or code snippet in `inspectdb.py` that handles table name to model conversion**: This is based on the assumption that table name conversion to model name logic is situated in the `inspectdb.py` file, but the specific method name is not provided.\n   `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"table name to model\", file_path=\"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with a good starting point to understand how `inspectdb` command handles table names currently and how we might allow users to override this logic."

The issue centers around enhancing the `inspectdb` command's capability to allow custom conversion of table names to model names during schema inspection. With the previous queries not yielding direct hits, we should consider alternative search strategies.\n\nA misunderstanding of the class search might have led to the incorrect query. If \"inspectdb.Command\" is not found, it could mean the class name or namespace might have been inaccurately identified. It's also worth noting that referencing `inspectdb.Command` directly might not align with Django's naming and organizational conventions.\n\nConsidering the unsuccessful search for a specific code snippet to convert table names to model names, we need to adopt a broader approach:\n\n1. **Locate the `inspectdb` command file directly without assuming a class name**. The command is likely defined in a similarly named Python file within the Django management commands structure.\n   \n2. **Explore the general mechanism of the `inspectdb` command without restricting to specific code phrases like \"table name to model\"**. Perhaps the conversion logic does not use this exact phrasing, which is why the search failed.\n\nHere are the refined or new queries to try:\n\n- Since we know the `inspectdb` command should exist within Django's `core.management.commands` package, let's search for any mention of \"inspectdb\" within this context without specifying it must be a class. This could involve invoking the API to search for a file rather than a class or method name.\n  `search_code(\"inspectdb\")`\n\n- Additionally, it would be valuable to directly inspect the content of `inspectdb.py`, since we expect the functionality to be there based on the issue description. This step involves directly getting content from the file that potentially contains the logic we want to override or extend.\n  `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\", 1, 10)`\n\nThese steps are designed to circumvent the limitations encountered in the initial queries and should bring us closer to understanding the current implementation of the `inspectdb` command. From there, we can better devise a way to introduce an override mechanism for the table name to model name conversion process."

However, we can theorize potential locations and intended behaviors based on the issue description and typical patterns in Django's command structure.\n\n### Theoretical Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** Likely within `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`\n  - **Class:** Not specifically identified from the provided results, but it would be the primary command class that implements the `handle` method or similar for the `inspectdb` command.\n  - **Method:** Potentially the method(s) involved in processing table names into model names. Since specific methods were not identified in the search results, the exact method names are speculative.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** \n  - A method should be introduced or an existing one modified to allow for customization of the table name to model name conversion process. This could involve adding a new method that can be easily overridden by subclasses or an entry point for passing a custom conversion function to the command.\n  - Preserve the default Django table name to model name conversion behavior as the base functionality. This ensures existing functionality is not broken for users who rely on the default naming conventions.\n  - Provide hooks or mechanisms for users to inject custom conversion logic, potentially through a command-line argument that specifies a module and method to use for conversion or through direct subclassing of the command with overrides.\n  \nDue to the constraints of the provided API call results and without additional context, this theoretical consideration aims to outline a general approach that aligns with the described issue. Actual implementation details would greatly benefit from more specific information regarding the current implementation within `inspectdb.py` and an understanding of where table name to model name conversion currently occurs."
