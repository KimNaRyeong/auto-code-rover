For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

Specifically, we need to understand the implementation details of these components to propose a patch that allows an `Exists` expression to be mixed with keyword arguments in a `When` clause without requiring a `Q` object wrapper.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls:\n\n1. To investigate the `When` class and its initialization method, which seems to be at the heart of the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"When\")`\n   \n2. To look at the implementation of the `Exists` expression to see how it's structured and whether there's something specific about it that doesn't play well with `When`:\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n   \n3. Since the issue describes a problem with using `When` within the `annotate` method, we should also look into how `annotate` is implemented, particularly how it handles conditions within `When`:\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n4. The `Case` statement is also mentioned as part of the code where the issue arises, so understanding its implementation could be important:\n   - `search_class(\"Case\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a broad context of how these components are implemented within Django and help us identify where modifications can be made to support the described functionality."

        "content": "Analyzing the context provided by our API calls reveals important insights into the Django ORM's handling of expressions and annotations, specifically focusing on the `When` class, the `Exists` expression, the `annotate` method, and the `Case` class. Let's address the questions for each part of the code.\n\n### `When` Class (from `django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `When` class is part of building conditional expressions in Django's ORM. It accepts conditions (`condition` parameter), what to return if the condition is true (`then`), and additional lookups as keyword arguments. It is used with the `Case` class to create conditional branches in database queries.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The issue describes a limitation where the `When` class cannot directly accept an `Exists` expression alongside keyword arguments without wrapping them in a `Q` object. Given the structure of the `__init__` method, it appears that the class does not have specific handling logic for combining `Exists` expressions directly with keyword arguments, contrary to how `filter` handles similar input.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Ideally, the `When` class should be capable of directly accepting an `Exists` expression and keyword arguments similarly to `filter` methods, facilitating more intuitive conditional expressions within Django's ORM without necessitating a workaround involving `Q` objects.\n\n### `Exists` Class (from `django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Exists` class is used for constructing `EXISTS` SQL expressions, which return a boolean indicating if any rows match the given subquery. It inherits from `Subquery` and specifies a boolean output field.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The issue arises when attempting to use an `Exists` expression within a `When` clause. The `Exists` class is designed to create standalone boolean conditions but doesn\u2019t inherently carry the logic for integration with keyword arguments in `When` expressions.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The `Exists` expression should be usable within `When` without additional workaround, indicating a need for better integration or handling logic within the `When` class to accommodate such patterns.\n\n### `annotate` Method (from `django/db/models/query.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `annotate` method allows adding additional fields to each object returned in a queryset, typically aggregations or computed values. It validates that given arguments are expressions and manages conflicts between automatically generated aliases and fields on the model.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - While the issue isn't directly related to the implementation of `annotate`, understanding how `annotate` validates and incorporates expressions into a queryset is essential. This context is critical since `annotate` is the method used to demonstrate the issue, indicating that the problem lies not with `annotate` itself but with how expressions like `When` and `Exists` are treated as arguments.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - For resolving the issue, `annotate` should continue functioning as it does but should be capable of accepting enhanced `When` expressions that can directly include `Exists` conditions alongside keyword arguments without necessitating `Q` objects.\n\n### `Case` Class (from `django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Case` class provides the ability to perform SQL `CASE` expressions, allowing conditional expressions to determine the value of a new field in a queryset. It can contain multiple `When` clauses, specifying different outcomes based on different conditions.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The reported issue implicates the `Case` class only to the extent that it is the container within which `When` expressions are used. The problem seems not to be with the `Case` class itself but with how `When` conditions are parsed and accepted.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The `Case` functionality should remain as is, but it should benefit from any enhancements to the `When` class that enable more flexible condition definitions, including direct support for `Exists` expressions with keyword arguments.\n\nIn conclusion, the core of the issue seems to be within the `When` class's handling of arguments, particularly its inability to natively integrate `Exists` expressions with keyword arguments, unlike other parts of Django's ORM that allow more direct and intuitive query definitions. Fixing the issue would likely involve adapting the `When` class to better parse and accept an `Exists` expression directly alongside keyword arguments."

This enhancement should enable developers to write more intuitive conditional expressions. The change must ensure that existing functionality, such as handling `Q` objects, boolean expressions, or lookups, remains unaffected. Specifically, the method could be adapted to check for an `Exists` expression and seamlessly integrate it with other keyword arguments, akin to how the `filter` method processes its conditions.\n\nThe modification should seek to maintain backward compatibility and not introduce breaking changes for existing codebases relying on the current behavior of `When`. Compatibility with other types of expressions and conditions used in `When` must be preserved, ensuring that any new logic specifically addresses the integration of `Exists` without disrupting the general utility of the `When` class for creating complex conditional queries in Django."
