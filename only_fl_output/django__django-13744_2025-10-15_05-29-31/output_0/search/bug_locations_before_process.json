        "intended_behavior": "The `MemcachedCache` class should be marked as deprecated starting from Django 3.2, which means introducing a warning indicating this deprecation whenever an instance of this class is initialized or a method of this class is called. This should alert developers to migrate to the advised alternative caching backend (`pymemcache`). The functionality of all methods (`__init__`, `get`, and `delete`) should remain unchanged to preserve existing behavior until removal in Django 4.1, ensuring that existing projects using `MemcachedCache` can continue to operate until they transition to the recommended caching backend. A deprecation warning could be introduced in the `__init__` method, as it's called whenever an instance is created, effectively notifying users of the deprecation at the point of use.\n\nThis approach ensures that the project communicates future changes effectively to its users, allowing them sufficient time to adapt their codebases while maintaining current functionalities."
