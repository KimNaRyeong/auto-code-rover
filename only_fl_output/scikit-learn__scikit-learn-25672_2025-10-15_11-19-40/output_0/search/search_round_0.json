Specifically, we aim to understand how the score function validates input data types and then how it computes the score, especially in scenarios involving binary relevance or small sizes of input lists. Based on the information provided in the issue, I will make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the method where the error is occurring to understand its current validation process:\n   - `search_method(\"_check_dcg_target_type\")`\n\n2. Get context around the `ndcg_score` method since the issue arises when it is called with a specific type of input:\n   - `search_method(\"ndcg_score\")`\n\n3. Locate where the error message is structured to see if there's any precedent or related validation logic:\n   - `search_code(\"Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported. Got binary instead\")`\n\nThese calls aim to provide a clear view of how the validation is implemented, the flow of the NDCG computation, and possibly pinpoint where to make adjustments or add a meaningful error for the case described."
