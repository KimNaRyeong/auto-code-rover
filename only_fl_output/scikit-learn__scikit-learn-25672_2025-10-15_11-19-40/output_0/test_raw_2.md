Certainly, given the specifics of your request, I'll incorporate the function to print stack traces in the context of a Python script aimed at reproducing the issue with the NDCG score. This script, `reproducer.py`, will raise an assertion when the issue persists and will exit gracefully if or when the issue is fixed. Please ensure your Python environment has scikit-learn installed and correctly configured before executing this script.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_ndcg_issue():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score
    
    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]
    try:
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        print(f"NDCG score calculated: {score}")
        # If the function returns a score without raising ValueError, it indicates the issue might have been fixed.
        # Depending on the context of the fix, you might want to assert a specific condition here.
    except ValueError as e:
        # If ValueError is caught, it might indicate the presence of the initially reported issue.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("NDCG function raised ValueError as expected for single-element lists with binary relevance.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other unexpected exceptions and printing their stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_ndcg_issue()
        exit(0)  # If the check passes without exceptions, exit with code 0 indicating no issues.
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the AssertionError was raised as expected due to the issue.
```

This script is designed to be directly run in the root directory of your project using Python 3. It intentionally raises an `AssertionError` if the execution path replicates the issue wherein the NDCG score doesn't work as expected under the given conditions. Conversely, the script exits with code 0 to signal a successful, error-free run, which could indicate that the issue has been resolved or does not replicate under the test conditions provided.
