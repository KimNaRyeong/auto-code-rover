        "content": "<issue>handle Decimal in json encoder\nThe `simplejson` removal (#3555) decreased the flask encoding capabilities as the built-in `json` doesn't cover cases like `Decimal` types. The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)\n```python\nfrom flask import json as fjson\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\nimport simplejson as sjson\nimport decimal\nfrom datetime import datetime\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\n```\nThe custom encoder:\n```python\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\n'''\nAdd Decimal coverage\n'''\ndef default(self, o):\nif isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\nreturn str(o)\nreturn super().default(o)\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\n```\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.8.10\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's examine the three areas individually:\n\n### 1. `JSONEncoder` Class Definition\n\nThe `JSONEncoder` class is extended from `_json.JSONEncoder` and is Flask's primary way of encoding objects to JSON. The class definition confirms the presence of a `default` method which is intended to be overridden to support custom object serialization.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** \nThe issue at hand involves making the `JSONEncoder` capable of serializing `Decimal` objects, which are not natively supported by Python's JSON serialization mechanisms. Since Flask's `JSONEncoder` doesn't handle `Decimal` natively, as indicated in the user report, the solution involves modifying or extending this `default` method.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\nTo integrate decimal handling into `JSONEncoder`, we'd expect the `default` method to be modified or extended in a way that checks for `Decimal` types explicitly and converts them into a serializable format (most likely a string).\n\n### 2. `default` Method in `JSONEncoder`\n\nThe provided `default` method implementation showcases how Flask's `JSONEncoder` handles serialization of specific types (e.g., dates, UUIDs, dataclasses, and objects with a `__html__` method). It serializes these objects into JSON-compatible formats or delegates to the super method from `_json.JSONEncoder` for objects it doesn't explicitly handle.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** \nThis method outlines the pattern we need to follow to add support for `Decimal` objects. Given that `Decimal` is not included in the overridden method, it explains why serialization fails for such objects.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\nWe aim to insert a conditional branch within this `default` method that checks if the object `o` is an instance of `Decimal`. If so, it should return a serialized form (like calling `str(o)`) that is compatible with JSON. This change would enable `Decimal` objects to be serialized directly by Flask without requiring additional dependencies or custom encoders.\n\n### 3. Setting Flask App's JSON Encoder\n\nThe failure to retrieve any instances of \"app.json_encoder =\" in the codebase suggests that setting or overriding the Flask app's JSON encoder isn't explicitly documented or illustrated within the codebase, or it's done in a way that wasn't captured by the search query.\n\n**Next steps in context gathering:**\nGiven the lack of direct examples on setting the Flask app's JSON encoder, it would be prudent to look up Flask documentation or source comments related to configuring the Flask app or the JSON encoder. This information is crucial for ensuring that once a new or modified JSON encoding strategy is implemented (including `Decimal` support), it can be properly integrated into a Flask application.\n\nA potential alternative API call could involve searching for documentation or comments in the source code related to configuring the Flask app (`JSONEncoder`), possibly with a broader search for \"json_encoder\" to catch relevant instances beyond assignment statements.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps in addressing the issue should involve:\n- Designing the extension to the `default` method within the `JSONEncoder` class to handle `Decimal` types explicitly.\n- Researching or requesting information (possibly through Flask documentation or community resources) on how to properly integrate a custom or modified JSON encoder into the Flask application setup, ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining Flask's default handling efficiency for other types. \n\nFurther context about integrating or setting a custom JSON encoder in Flask could be beneficial, possibly requiring a broader or more nuanced search strategy."

This extension should preserve the existing functionality of the code for serializing dates, UUIDs, dataclasses, and objects with a `__html__` method while adding a new conditional branch to check for `decimal.Decimal` instances.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should be updated as follows:\n\n- Check if the object `o` is an instance of `decimal.Decimal`.\n- If so, return `str(o)` to convert the `Decimal` to a string that is JSON serializable. This approach mirrors how other specific types are handled within the method, ensuring that `Decimal` objects can be serialized without breaking compatibility with `datetime` objects or any other types currently supported.\n- This change allows both `Decimal` and `datetime` objects to be correctly serialized by Flask's built-in JSON encoding mechanisms, eliminating the need for workarounds that involve switching back to `simplejson` or writing custom encoders for common use cases.\n\nThe code snippet elaborating the intended behavior:\n\n```python\ndef default(self, o: t.Any) -> t.Any:\n    ...\n    if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\n        return str(o)  # This line is to be added for Decimal handling\n    ...\n    return super().default(o)\n```"
