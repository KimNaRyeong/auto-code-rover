Let's correct the script to accurately check for the presence of the issue and exit accordingly. Based on your requirements, the script `reproducer.py` should explicitly verify the behavior of `expand_trig` with `csch` and `sech`, and raise an `AssertionError` only if the issue persists (i.e., these functions do not expand as expected). However, we want to ensure it prints a message and exits with 0 when the issue no longer presents, indicating the issue has been addressed:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, expand_trig, csch, sech, tanh

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Test expansion of tanh to ensure it behaves as expected
    tanh_expanded = expand_trig(tanh(x + y))
    # No need for assertions on tanh_expanded, just for reference

    try:
        # Check if csch and sech are not expanded correctly
        csch_expanded = expand_trig(csch(x + y))
        sech_expanded = expand_trig(sech(x + y))

        # Passing conditions
        if csch_expanded == csch(x + y) or sech_expanded == sech(x + y):
            raise AssertionError("csch and/or sech expansion did not modify the input.")

        print("Issue has been fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is tailored to identify the exact issue with `csch` and `sech` expansion by comparing their expanded forms with the original input. If the expansion does not occur, implying that the expanded form is the same as the input, it indicates the issue is present. In such a case, the custom `print_stacktrace` function will detail the error, and the script exits with code 0, signaling that the issue was successfully reproduced based on the presence of the assertion error. Conversely, if expansions for both functions work as intended, implying the issue has been addressed, the script will print a success message without raising an `AssertionError`.
