        "intended_behavior": "The `expand_trig` method currently expands trigonometric expressions using trigonometric identities. To resolve the issue, this method should also include logic for expanding hyperbolic trigonometric functions like `csch` and `sech`. This involves implementing additional rules or cases within `expand_trig` or the underlying `expand` method it calls, specifically to handle expressions involving `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` to expand them as expected based on hyperbolic trigonometric identities. This expansion should mirror the handling of `csc` and `sec` by using analogous hyperbolic identities while preserving existing functionality for all other expressions."

        "intended_behavior": "The `csch` class may need additional methods or adjustments to existing methods (such as `_eval_expand_trig` if it does not exist or modifications to it if it does) that enable it to be correctly expanded by `expand_trig`. These changes should ensure that expressions involving `csch(x + y)` are expanded using appropriate hyperbolic trigonometric identities, aligning with the behavior for `csc(x + y)`."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `csch`, the `sech` class needs modifications or new implementations that allow for correct expansion within `expand_trig`. This could involve defining a method that directly addresses how `sech(x + y)` expressions are expanded, leveraging the analogous behavior as seen with `sec(x + y)`. The goal is to enable the application of hyperbolic trigonometric identities within the expansion process without disrupting existing functionality."
