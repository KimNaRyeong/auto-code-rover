        "intended_behavior": "The `hamming_loss` function will no longer accept a `labels` parameter. References to this parameter within the function should be removed. Instead of dynamically determining the number of labels through `len(labels)` or inferring it when `labels is None`, the function will directly use `y_true.shape[1]` to determine the number of labels for multilabel cases. This change assumes that `y_true` always accurately reflects all possible labels in multilabel classification, making the explicit `labels` parameter redundant. The logic adjustment will ensure that the hamming loss is calculated based on the full breadth of labels present in the `y_true` matrix for multilabel scenarios, simplifying the function's usage and aligning it with its primary use case."
