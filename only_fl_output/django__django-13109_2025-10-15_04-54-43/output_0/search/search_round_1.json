This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To directly address the issue described, we need context around the validation process of a ForeignKey in Django, specifically in relation to how `validate()` behaves regarding managers. The critical path seems to hinge on the `ForeignKey.validate()` method and the mechanism by which it selects the manager for validation. The suggestion indicates moving from `_default_manager` to `_base_manager` within this validation context.\n\nGiven the details in the issue, I'll proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `ForeignKey` class in the codebase**: Understanding the structure of the `ForeignKey` class might give us insights into the validation method and its relations.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the `validate` method in `ForeignKey` class**: This method is directly implicated in the issue, thus examining its definition and usage is vital.\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n3. **Get the code around the validation process in the `ForeignKey`**: Since the issue identifies the exact location in the GitHub repository, we can substitute this with a line number approach if we assume the codebase structure to be similar. Assuming line 917 is where the validation method begins or at least represents a critical portion of the validation logic:\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/fields/related.py\", 917, 10)\n```\n\nThese API calls are designed to gather detailed context about how `ForeignKey` validation is currently implemented and why it might not adhere to the expected behavior when using a non-default manager. This information will be foundational for drafting a patch that adjusts the validation behavior to use `_base_manager`, aligning with the suggested solution."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `ForeignKey` class, especially focusing on the `validate` method, we can draw several conclusions in response to the posed questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\nThe `validate` method within the `ForeignKey` class is responsible for checking if the provided value corresponds to a valid instance in the database. It does this by constructing a queryset using the `_default_manager` of the related model, filtering by the field specified in the `ForeignKey` relationship, and verifying if any record exists in the database that matches this criteria.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe reported issue is directly related to this method's use of the `_default_manager` to perform its validation check. When a custom manager (like `ArticleManager` in the given example) filters out certain instances (e.g., archived articles), and `_default_manager` respects these filters, archived articles are considered non-existent by this validation logic, even if they exist in the database. This behavior contradicts the intended usage of `FavoriteArticlesForm`, where archived articles should be valid choices.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior, as suggested, would require the `validate` method to utilize the `_base_manager` instead of the `_default_manager`. The `_base_manager` does not apply any custom filtering set by custom managers, and thus, it would consider all instances of the model, including those filtered out by the default manager's custom logic (e.g., archived articles).\n\nTo patch the issue, a modification in the `validate` method's logic is needed. Instead of:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(\n    **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n)\n```\nIt should be updated to use:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(\n    **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n)\n```\nThis change ensures that the validation logic considers all instances, including those that might be excluded by the custom filters applied in the model's default manager. This approach aligns with the desired flexibility intended by the usage of different managers for various aspects of interacting with Django models."

Bug Location 1: \n- File: `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n- Class: `ForeignKey`\n- Method: `validate`\n  \nIntended Behavior: The intended behavior at this location is to modify the queryset construction to use `_base_manager` instead of `_default_manager`. This change will ensure that the validation logic includes all instances of the related model, disregarding any exclusions imposed by custom managers. Preserving the existing functionality means the `validate` method should continue to accurately validate foreign key references, but it should do so in a manner that considers the entirety of the database, including soft-deleted or otherwise filtered-out instances by the default manager. This modification is crucial for situations where forms or other mechanisms rely on the inclusion of instances that are normally excluded by the default queryset of a model's manager."
