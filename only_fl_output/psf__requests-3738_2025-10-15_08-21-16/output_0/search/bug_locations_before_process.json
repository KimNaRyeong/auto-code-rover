        "intended_behavior": "The method prepare_request should be adapted to allow URLs with non-standard schemes (e.g., http+unix) to have their parameters handled similarly to standard HTTP/HTTPS schemes. This could be achieved by enhancing the scheme recognition logic within this method, or closely associated methods, to include a wider array of schemes or by implementing a mechanism where custom schemes can be registered along with their parameter handling behavior. Preservation of existing functionality is crucial; thus, this extension should only come into play for schemes recognized as needing HTTP-like parameter handling but are not natively supported by the library. This might involve either directly modifying how url and params are prepared within this method or interfacing with a broader scheme handling feature that allows for custom scheme processing."

        "intended_behavior": "Considering the issue's suggestion about having a registry for URL preparation based on the scheme, it could be beneficial to introduce a new method or mechanism within the Session class (or a utility function accessible by session instances) that allows for the registration of custom URL schemes and their handling logic. This would not involve directly fixing a bug in existing methods but enhancing the class's capabilities to address the issue described. Such a mechanism would allow users of the Requests library to add support for non-standard schemes on an as-needed basis, specifying how parameters should be added to URLs with those schemes, without impacting the treatment of standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs."
