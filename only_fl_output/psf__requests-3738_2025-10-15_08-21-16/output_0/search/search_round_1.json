This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "### Analyzing Collected Context\n\n#### `Session` Class Analysis\nThe `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` is a central piece of the Requests library, handling HTTP requests' preparation and sending. It includes methods to initiate requests (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc.), manage sessions (e.g., cookies, headers), and prepare requests for sending with the `prepare_request` method. \n\n#### `prepare_request` Method Analysis\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `prepare_request` method constructs a `PreparedRequest` object from a `Request` object, applying various settings and merges from the session's default behavior. This includes setting up cookies, authentication, headers, parameters, and data payloads.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n   - The method is deeply involved in preparing URLs for requests, including parameters handling (`params=merge_setting(request.params, self.params)`). If there's a bug related to not adding parameters to URLs with unrecognized schemes, it's likely that modifications are needed within this method or the processes it interfaces with regarding how URLs are prepared and how parameters are merged.\n   \n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior would involve adapting the `prepare_request` (or a related process) to recognize custom or unrecognized schemes in a way that parameters can still be appropriately added to requests using these schemes. This may involve some form of scheme registration or opt-in mechanism to allow for HTTP-like processing of such URLs.\n\n### Further Analysis Requirement\nGiven the analysis and the issue outlined, there appears to be a gap in understanding how Requests deals with URL schemes specifically and how parameters are handled for unrecognized schemes. The bug reported suggests that Requests should allow special-case handling or registration for non-standard schemes like `http+unix`, which is not currently apparent in the provided code snippets or in the search results returned.\n\n#### Additional API Calls Required\n\n1. **Understanding URL Scheme Processing:**\n   Since direct searches for scheme handling and unrecognized scheme code did not yield results, it might be necessary to look into methods or functions related to URL processing more broadly. Possibly, these functionalities are handled in utility functions or in the methods that call `prepare_request`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"parse_url\")\nsearch_code(\"scheme\")\n```\n\n2. **Exploring `PreparedRequest`:**\n   Given that `prepare_request` generates a `PreparedRequest` object, understanding how this object handles URLs (and by extension, their schemes) may provide additional insights.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"PreparedRequest\")\n```\n\n3. **Fallback Strategy:**\n   If recognizing custom schemes is not directly supported, it may be necessary to examine hooks or middleware-like functionalities that could be used to preprocess requests or extend the library's behavior.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_adapter\")\n```\n\nThis method seems to be responsible for determining which adapter to use for a given request, which could be central to handling different schemes in a customizable manner.\n\nWith these additional steps, we should be able to gather the necessary context to address the issue effectively."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This could be achieved by enhancing the scheme recognition logic within this method, or closely associated methods, to include a wider array of schemes or by implementing a mechanism where custom schemes can be registered along with their parameter handling behavior. Preservation of existing functionality is crucial; thus, this extension should only come into play for schemes recognized as needing HTTP-like parameter handling but are not natively supported by the library. This might involve either directly modifying how `url` and `params` are prepared within this method or interfacing with a broader scheme handling feature that allows for custom scheme processing.\n\n    - **Location 2:** File: `requests/sessions.py`, Class: `Session`, Method: N/A\n        - **Intended Behavior:** Considering the issue's suggestion about having a registry for URL preparation based on the scheme, it could be beneficial to introduce a new method or mechanism within the `Session` class (or a utility function accessible by session instances) that allows for the registration of custom URL schemes and their handling logic. This would not involve directly fixing a bug in existing methods but enhancing the class's capabilities to address the issue described. Such a mechanism would allow users of the Requests library to add support for non-standard schemes on an as-needed basis, specifying how parameters should be added to URLs with those schemes, without impacting the treatment of standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs."
