        "content": "Given the context of reproducing the issue along with the requirements to properly capture and handle errors within a standalone Python file, you would first need to ensure that any dependencies, such as `antlr4` for parsing Latex in `Sympy`, are addressed. Since the error indicates a missing module which is crucial for latex parsing, any reproducer should ideally first check for this dependency or handle the scenario gracefully where it is not present. Below is an updated approach that incorporates a basic check for the `antlr4` module before attempting to parse the Latex expression. This script will still attempt to reproduce the issue described but will exit gracefully with a more informative message if critical dependencies are not installed.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef check_dependencies():\n    try:\n        import antlr4  # This import check is simplistic; further checks might be needed for specific antlr4 features.\n    except ImportError as e:\n        print(\"Critical dependency for LaTeX parsing is missing: antlr4. Please install it and try again.\")\n        exit(1)  # Exit with error state due to missing dependency.\n\ndef main():\n    check_dependencies()  # Ensure antlr4 is available\n\n    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex\n    try:\n        # Parse the problematic Latex expression\n        expr = parse_latex(\"\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}\")\n        # Expected parsed expression as a string for comparison\n        expected_expr = '((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))'\n        # Convert the expression to a string to compare with the expected string representation\n        if str(expr) != expected_expr:\n            raise AssertionError(f'Parsed expression {expr} is not as expected.')\n        else:\n            print(\"No issue detected with the parsing of the provided LaTeX expression.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(2)  # Exit with a distinct error code for capturing and handling.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script now incorporates a pre-check for the `antlr4` dependency, which is crucial for the execution of the `Sympy` LaTeX parser. This should ensure that the script fails gracefully with an informative message if needed dependencies are missing, rather than proceeding to an operation which it knows will fail. The exit codes have been adjusted to reflect different failure modes: code `1` for missing dependencies and code `2` for errors during parsing or assertion failure, thereby providing a clearer distinction for different types of failures during execution."
