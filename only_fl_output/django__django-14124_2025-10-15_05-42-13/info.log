The modification should ensure that when a class-based view is used, the method recognizes that the view's inherent method signature (including self) does not conflict with the expected signature for error handlers.\n\nThe method should include an additional check to determine if the handler in question is a class-based view. If it is, it should adjust its validation logic to account for the presence of self in the method signature. One approach might be to inspect if the handler is an instance of Django's class-based view base class or if the handler's method corresponds to what is typically generated by Django's as_view() method for class-based views.\n\nSpecifically, for handler500, the validation should ensure that, beyond self, only one additional argument (request) is accepted when the handler is identified as class-based. This adjustment maintains the existing functionality while accommodating class-based views as handler500 error handlers without raising a SystemCheckError."}]
