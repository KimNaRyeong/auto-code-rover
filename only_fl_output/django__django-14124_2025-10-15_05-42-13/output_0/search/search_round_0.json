The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

Search the Django framework's codebase for the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method to understand its current implementation and where modifications are needed.\n   - `search_method(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with class-based views being used as error handlers (`handler500`) and the expected signature of such handlers, it is essential to also look at how Django distinguishes class-based views from function-based views in the context of error handling. For that purpose, examining any utility or method in Django that checks whether a view is class-based might be valuable.\n   - `search_code(\"is class-based view\")`\n\nThese calls aim to provide insight into the part of Django's URL resolver system that processes custom error handlers and how it currently identifies and validates the type and signature of these handlers."
