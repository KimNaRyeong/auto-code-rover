        "intended_behavior": "This code block should target the correct database for operations on the Permission model in a multi-database setup. Django's database routing logic should be leveraged to determine the appropriate database for executing these operations, or the database should be explicitly specified if Django's default behavior does not select the correct one. An approach could involve using Django's database routing mechanisms to explicitly specify the database alias in .using(alias) for the Permission.objects.filter(...) query to ensure it is executed against the intended database. Preserve existing functionality by ensuring that Permission objects related to proxy models are correctly updated, irrespective of the database configuration. This means the patch must not affect single database setups or multi-database setups where a default database is correctly specified and used."

        "intended_behavior": "While the atomic function itself is not faulty, enhancing its documentation or supporting mechanisms to highlight considerations or recommended practices for multi-database transactions in migrations might be beneficial. Specifically, elucidate on the usage of using parameter to enforce atomic blocks on a specific database in a multi-database setup, especially in the context of migrations which might not straightforwardly deduce the correct database. This enhancement aims to improve developer awareness and prevent misuse or confusion in similar scenarios, though it directly does not alter the functionality."
