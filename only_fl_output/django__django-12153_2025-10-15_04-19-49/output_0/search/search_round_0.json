        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue described, we would target the following areas based on the issue description:\n\n1. Examine the migration script `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` mentioned, particularly around line 42 to understand the use of `transaction.atomic()` and `Permission.objects.filter(...)`.\n2. Understand how `Permission` class is implemented or used, since the `.filter()` method on `Permission.objects` and `.update()` method call are directly relevant to the failure.\n3. Get details or implementation of `transaction.atomic()` to understand how transactions are being handled in this context.\n\nLet's focus on the files and methods:\n\n- Since the issue is within a migration script, we need to look at the specific file `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` in the Django project to contextualize the problem around line 42.\n- Understanding the `Permission` class might provide insights into how permissions are handled, and if any database routing logic needs to be considered when running migrations in a multi-database environment.\n- It is also important to see how `transaction.atomic()` is expected to behave in this scenario to check if the transaction management has any influence on the observed issue.\n\nFor these reasons, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n```plaintext\nget_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py\", 42, 10)\nsearch_class(\"Permission\")\nsearch_method(\"atomic\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the migration script where the error occurs, explore the `Permission` class for any clues on how the `update` operation might behave differently in a multi-database setup, and understand how transactions are being managed with `transaction.atomic()`."
