I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, it's important to understand how `selector` objects are structured within the MNE library, specifically within the context of Matplotlib from which the deprecation warning originates. Given the mentioned deprecation warning and the desire to find a proper migration path that does not rely on what seems to be a hack workaround, we need to investigate how `selector` objects, including their `rect` attribute and related properties, are being handled in the codebase. Therefore, I will focus on finding relevant classes, methods, and code snippets that could provide insights into proper usage and potential migration paths for deprecated functionality.\n\n1. **Search for the class or method related to `selector` objects:**\nSince the issue mentions that it's within MNE, which uses Matplotlib, and there's a reference to `selector.rect`, it's possible that `selector` is part of a specific class in Matplotlib dealing with interactive selection mechanisms. However, without knowing the exact class name, we can start by looking into methods or classes related to `set_color` and properties update patterns within selector functionalities.\n\n2. **Look for the deprecated functionality to understand its usage and then find its replacement:**\nThe issue describes the use of `selector.rect.set_color(color)` and updates to `rectprops` with `selector.rectprops.update(dict(facecolor=color))`, followed by a deprecation warning from a specific issue (`#20113`). Understanding how these methods were supposed to be migrated according to the deprecation warning would provide clues for a proper fix.\n\nGiven these points, I propose the following search API calls:\n- `search_method(\"set_color\")`: to find how the `set_color` method is used across the project, which might lead us to the class that implements `selector`.\n- `search_code(\"rectprops.update\")`: to find instances where `rectprops` is being updated, which may reveal the correct way to handle property updates post-deprecation.\n- `search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")`: to identify where in the codebase this exact deprecated functionality is being used, potentially revealing immediate usages that might also include comments or TODOs for migration plans.\n\nThese searches aim to uncover both the current usage of the deprecated features and the direction for migration suggested (if any) within the library's codebase."
