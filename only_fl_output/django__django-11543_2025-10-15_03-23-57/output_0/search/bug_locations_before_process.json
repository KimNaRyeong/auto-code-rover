        "intended_behavior": "The `Command` class within `runserver.py`, particularly around the argument parsing and server initialization logic, should ensure that when the `--nothreading` flag is used, the server gracefully handles multiple connections with `Connection: keep-alive`. This might involve implementing a mechanism that either properly closes such connections after handling a request (despite the client's request to keep them alive) or effectively manages such connections in a non-blocking way despite threading being disabled. The fix should ensure that the server remains responsive to new incoming connections even when previous ones are in a keep-alive state. This adjustment should preserve the server's ability to run without threading for debugging reasons or whatever purpose the `--nothreading` option serves, without causing it to hang due to unhandled keep-alive connections."
