But the first connection will not be closed by browser for very long time.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context and identify the possible locations in the codebase that could be related to the reported issue, we need to understand how the Django `runserver` command handles connections, particularly with the `--nothreading` option. Given the description, it's likely the issue lies within the `WSGI` server implementation used by Django's development server or the command logic itself. Here's a plan to collect the necessary information:\n\n1. Identify where the `runserver` command is implemented in Django's codebase.\n2. Look into how the `WSGI` server is initiated and how it handles connections, especially concerning threading options.\n3. Check how connections are closed or kept alive as this seems to be the crux of the issue.\n\nBased on these steps, I'll make the following search API calls:\n\n- To find the command implementation: `search_class(\"Command\") and search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"Command\")`.\n  \n  The `runserver` command would likely inherit from a base command class, possibly named something like `Command`, and the `handle` method is commonly used in Django management commands to encapsulate the command's logic.\n\n- To understand the WSGI server initiation and behavior: `search_method(\"WSGIServer\")` and `search_method(\"serve_forever\")`.\n  \n  `WSGIServer` would be the class or method responsible for initiating the server, and `serve_forever` or a similarly named method would be responsible for running the server in a loop to handle incoming connections.\n\n- To examine connection handling, especially with no threading: `search_code(\"--nothreading\")`.\n\nSince the issue specifically mentions the `--nothreading` option causing problems, searching for references to this option can help identify where in the code this behavior is handled or toggled.\n\nLet's perform these search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"Command\")`\n2. `search_method(\"WSGIServer\")`\n3. `search_method(\"serve_forever\")`\n4. `search_code(\"--nothreading\")`"
