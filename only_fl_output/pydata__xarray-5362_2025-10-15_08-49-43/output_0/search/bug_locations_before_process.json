        "intended_behavior": "The `mean` method within the `Weighted` class should include validation steps to check if the dimensions passed by the user exist in the data array. If a non-existent dimension is provided, the method should immediately raise a clear and informative error message, such as `ValueError: Dimension 'dummy' does not exist.` This error handling aims to alert the user about the mistake without proceeding with the calculation, which helps in maintaining consistency with unweighted operations and improves the library's usability.\n\nBy integrating this validation, we ensure that the functionality mirrors that of unweighted operations more closely, adhering to the principle of least surprise for the user. It's crucial that this check is performed before any computationally intensive operations to avoid unnecessary processing and to quickly guide users towards rectifying their input. The addition should maintain the existing functionality for valid dimension inputs, ensuring that the method's behavior is unchanged for correct usage scenarios."
