Understood, attempting to construct a revised version of the `reproducer.py` while adhering closely to the initial problem statement and guidelines provided. The primary goal remains to accurately emulate the issue regarding the non-raising of errors by weighted operations with non-existent dimensions in xarray, and verify the resolution or persistence of this specific behavior.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        # Assuming "air_temperature" is available for this test. Adjust as necessary.
        ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")
        # Attempt a weighted operation with a non-existing dimension.
        ds.weighted(xr.ones_like(ds["air"])).mean("dummy_dimension")

        # If the operation passes without raising an error, the expected behavior is not met.
        print("The operation did not raise an error.")
        raise AssertionError("The operation did not raise an error for a non-existing dimension.")

    except KeyError as expected:
        # This is the desired outcome: a KeyError for a non-existent dimension.
        print("The operation raised an error as expected for a non-existing dimension.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # For any other exceptions, print the stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script has been designed with the express purpose of confirming whether weighted operations in xarray correctly raise an error when supplied with non-existent dimensions. Upon successful execution, an `AssertionError` indicates the issue persists, aiding in reproducing the problem. Conversely, normal termination (exit code 0) following the catching of a `KeyError` suggests compliant behavior aligning with expectations, thus indicating a resolved issue.
