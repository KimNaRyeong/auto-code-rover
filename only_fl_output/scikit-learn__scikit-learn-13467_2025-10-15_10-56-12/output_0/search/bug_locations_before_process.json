When `squared=True`, the method calculates and returns the mean squared error as it currently does. When `squared=False`, the method calculates the mean squared error as before but then returns its square root, thus giving the root mean squared error (RMSE). This change allows direct access to RMSE calculations without changing the function's default behavior or impacting existing code that depends on it."

        "intended_behavior": "After modifying the `mean_squared_error` function to include an RMSE calculation option, introduce a new scorer called `neg_root_mean_squared_error` using the `make_scorer` function. This scorer would use the newly enhanced `mean_squared_error` function with `squared=False` to compute RMSE and would be designed to follow the convention that higher values are better. Thus, it should multiply the RMSE by -1 before returning it. This scorer extends the library's capability to include a direct, standardized method for assessing models using RMSE in a manner compatible with scikit-learn's evaluation tools. This will involve defining the scorer in `scorer.py` and ensuring it is recognized alongside other standard scorers within scikit-learn, making it readily available for users in model evaluation contexts."
