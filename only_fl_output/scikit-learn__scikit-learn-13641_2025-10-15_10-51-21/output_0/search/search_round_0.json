Here are the specific API calls to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CountVectorizer\")`: This will help us locate the `CountVectorizer` class in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"CountVectorizer\")`: Since the issue arises during the usage of the `fit` method, we need to look into its implementation.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"CountVectorizer\")`: Analyzing the constructor of `CountVectorizer` can give insight into how the `input` argument is intended to be used.\n4. `search_code(\"input='filename'\")`: This will help us find occurrences where the `input` parameter is set, providing context on its intended use cases."
