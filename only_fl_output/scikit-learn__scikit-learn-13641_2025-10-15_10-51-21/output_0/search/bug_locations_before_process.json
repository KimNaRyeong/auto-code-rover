This could involve preprocessing the input files into strings or documents in a format that the custom analyzer can process directly. This preprocessing step should respect the distinction between 'content', 'file', and 'filename' to ensure the raw documents are appropriately prepared for analysis without compromising the custom analyzer's functionality."

This adaptation should not affect the method's behavior when 'content' is used as input, preserving existing functionality while extending support for file inputs with custom analyzers."
