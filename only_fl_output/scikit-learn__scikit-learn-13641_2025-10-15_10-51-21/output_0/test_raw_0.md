This standalone Python script aims to reproduce the mentioned issue in which `CountVectorizer` with a custom analyzer ignores the input argument. If the issue exists, the script will assert and fail because `CountVectorizer` does not correctly process the input type as expected, leading to the incorrect assumption that the custom analyzer will respect the `input='filename'` parameter. The script uses a custom function `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error tracebacks for diagnosing the problem better. Upon resolution or absence of the identified issue, the script will gracefully exit with a success code (0), indicating that the issue is either fixed or was not encountered under the test conditions provided.
