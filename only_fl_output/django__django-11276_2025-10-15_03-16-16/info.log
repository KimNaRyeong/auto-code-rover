To address the performance issue, replace the current implementation's use of `.translate(_html_escapes)` with Python standard library's `html.escape()`. This change is expected to improve performance based on the benchmarks shared in the issue description. Ensure that the output is still marked as safe for HTML rendering. This may involve wrapping the output of `html.escape()` with `mark_safe` to maintain compatibility with Django's security mechanisms. Regarding the change in escaped apostrophes (`'` becoming `&#x27;` instead of `&#39;`), confirm that it doesn't adversely affect Django's template rendering or any other components that might depend on the specific escape sequences. Adjustments or additional documentation may be necessary to address this minor backward incompatibility. This change implies a careful review is needed for any part of the Django framework or dependent projects that might assume or rely on the specific escape sequences produced by Django's current `escape` method, ensuring that the proposed optimization does not inadvertently introduce bugs or regressions."}]
