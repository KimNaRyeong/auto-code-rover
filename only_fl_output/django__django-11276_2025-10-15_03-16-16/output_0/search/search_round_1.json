We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `escape` method in `django/utils/html.py` provides insight into how Django currently handles the escaping of HTML entities within given text. Given the issue at hand, here's a breakdown based on the questions provided:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe function `escape` in `django/utils/html.py` takes text as input and encodes ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe use in HTML. It forcibly escapes all input, even if it's already escaped, which might lead to double-escaping. This behavior is explicitly noted in the function's documentation, suggesting an alternative (`conditional_escape()`) for cases where double-escaping might be problematic. The output is marked safe using `mark_safe`, implying it's been sanitized and can be safely rendered in templates without further escaping.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue is suggesting replacing Django's custom implementation of HTML escaping with Python standard library's `html.escape()` method, which has been proven to be more performant. Currently, Django's version of `escape` uses `.translate(_html_escapes)` for replacing characters, which potentially could be less efficient than the method used in the stdlib. Moreover, the issue mentions a minor backwards incompatible change regarding the representation of escaped apostrophes, highlighting a difference in output between Django's version and `html.escape()` from the Python standard library.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nPost-replacement, the intended behavior of this part of the code would still be to safely escape text for HTML usage, but it would leverage the `html.escape()` function for improved performance and maintainability. The change aims to preserve the core functionality of text escaping while optimizing execution speed based on findings from Python bug reports and timeit benchmarks mentioned in the issue. It's expected to seamlessly integrate with Django's existing template rendering mechanisms, potentially requiring adjustments to account for the minor difference in how apostrophes are escaped.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven that the search for `django.utils.html.escape` usage returned no results, it indicates either the search was too specific or that the function's usage might be more implicit within Django's template rendering system or other components. Since understanding the extent of `escape`'s usage is crucial for assessing the impact of the proposed change, especially in terms of backward compatibility and potential side-effects, a broader search strategy might be required. \n\nConsidering the absence of direct references to `django.utils.html.escape`, exploring how templates and other parts of Django utilize escaping mechanisms might offer more insight. Specifically, investigating how `mark_safe` and possibly `conditional_escape` are employed throughout Django could shed light on indirect usages of the `escape` method. \n\nGiven the lack of results from the direct search for usage, alternative steps could include:\n- Searching for `mark_safe` to understand its relationship with `escape` function indirectly.\n- Exploring usages of `conditional_escape` since the comment in `escape` mentions it as an alternative, possibly uncovering related code paths where HTML escaping is relevant."

This change is expected to improve performance based on the benchmarks shared in the issue description.\n   - Ensure that the output is still marked as safe for HTML rendering.
