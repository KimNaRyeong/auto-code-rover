This change aims to leverage the performance benefits and community support of the Python standard library's implementation. The method should continue to guarantee that the escaped output is safe for rendering in HTML contexts. The transition to `html.escape()` must consider the minor difference in escaping apostrophes, ensuring that it doesn't negatively affect Django's functionality or security posture. Output from `html.escape()` should still be wrapped with `mark_safe`, ensuring that Django templates recognize the output as safe to render without further escaping."
