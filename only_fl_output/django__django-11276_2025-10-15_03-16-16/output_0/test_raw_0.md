This script specifically checks if Django's `escape` function produces the same output as the Python Standard Library's `html.escape()` function. Based on the original issue description, the concern is about Django's version producing different output than `html.escape()`, particularly in how it escapes single quotes (`'`). The test intentionally looks for any mismatch between the outputs of these two functions when provided with a common test string that includes characters needing to be escaped in HTML.

If the outputs match, it suggests that Django's `escape` function behaves as expected compared to the standard library version, thus not raising any `AssertionError`. However, if there's a mismatch due to Django's `escape` function not being updated or behaving differently, the script raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace to indicate where the issue occurred.

The script exits with code 0 (success) when the issue is fixed, meaning no `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that Django's escape implementation matches or has been replaced by the standard library's `html.escape()`.
