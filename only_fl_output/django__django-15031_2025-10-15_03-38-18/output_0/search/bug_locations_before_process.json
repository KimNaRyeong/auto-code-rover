        "intended_behavior": "The `prepare_lookup_value` method should be enhanced to allow for the inclusion of values that contain commas for the `__in` field lookup. This would involve modifying the method to support either escaping commas within values or introducing a more sophisticated parsing algorithm that can accurately distinguish between commas that serve as delimiters and those that are part of the values. The essence of this enhancement is to ensure that when a query string comes in formatted for an `__in` lookup, the method can correctly parse values, regardless of their complexity or use of commas. To preserve the existing functionality, any change must still accept the standard comma-separated format for straightforward cases (e.g., `username__in=john,dave,bob`) without requiring additional input or syntax for cases that don't include commas within values. Only in scenarios where values contain commas should additional parsing logic be applied, possibly through an escaping mechanism (e.g., using a backslash to escape commas within values or wrapping such values in quotes). This update would directly address the bug by enabling the Django admin to filter querysets using `__in` lookups even when the values contain commas, thus greatly enhancing the flexibility and use cases of the admin filtering feature."
