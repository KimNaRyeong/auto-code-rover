        "intended_behavior": "The `Normalize` class should have an update mechanism, such as a method or a pattern to notify all linked scalar-mappable objects (`AxesImage`, colorbars, etc.) whenever its state changes (i.e., whenever `vmin`, `vmax`, or other properties affecting normalization are modified). This can be achieved by incorporating a signal or callback system within the `Normalize` class, similar to what exists in the `CallbackRegistry`. When properties `vmin` or `vmax` are modified, this new mechanism should trigger the necessary callbacks that would, in turn, refresh or update all visuals dependent on this `Normalize` instance. This change ensures visuals remain consistent with the data state, preserving the existing functionality while adding the necessary update propagation."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Ensure the `AxesImage` class (and potentially other scalar-mappable classes) listens to and adequately responds to notifications from its associated `Normalize` instance about changes. This might involve either adding a new method to register itself to receive notifications from `Normalize` and/or ensuring existing methods like `set_norm` include logic to handle such updates efficiently. Whenever a `Normalize` instance signals a change, `AxesImage` should refresh its appearance based on the new normalization parameters. This involves potentially reapplying the normalization to its data and triggering a redraw."
