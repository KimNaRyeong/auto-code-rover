First, in the cache setting code, it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nnow = timezone.now()\nnow = now.replace(microsecond=0)\nif num > self._max_entries:\nself._cull(db, cursor, now)\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L120-L131)\nThen in self._cull (the last line above) it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L254-L260)\nThe idea is that if the MAX_ENTRIES setting is exceeded, it'll cull the DB cache down by some percentage so it doesn't grow forever.\nI think that's fine, but given that the SELECT COUNT(*) query is slow, I wonder two things:\nWould a refactor to remove the second query be a good idea? If you pass the count from the first query into the _cull method, you can then do:\ndef _cull(self, db, cursor, now, count):\n...\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ndeleted_count = cursor.rowcount\nnum = count - deleted_count\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\nThat seems like a simple win.\nIs it reasonable to not run the culling code *every* time that we set a value? Like, could we run it every tenth time or every 100th time or something?\nIf this is a good idea, does anybody have a proposal for how to count this? I'd be happy just doing it on a mod of the current millisecond, but there's probably a better way (randint?).\nWould a setting be a good idea here? We already have MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY. CULL_FREQUENCY is \"the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached.\" That sounds more like it should have been named CULL_RATIO (regrets!), but maybe a new setting for this could be called \"CULL_EVERY_X\"?\nI think the first change is a no-brainer, but both changes seem like wins to me. Happy to implement either or both of these, but wanted buy-in first.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Having collected context from the `DatabaseCache` class and its methods `set` and `_cull`, let's analyze each part concerning the performance issue related to counting the database size twice and how each part is related to the bug:\n\n### Analysis of `DatabaseCache` Class\n\nThe `DatabaseCache` class extends from `BaseDatabaseCache` and includes several methods for interacting with the cache stored in a database. It provides functionality for retrieving, setting, adding, touching, deleting, and checking for the existence of cache keys, as well as a method for culling expired entries (`_cull`). \n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThis class is where our issue resides, particularly in how it handles the determination of when to cull the cache entries based on its size (`set` and `_cull` methods). The issue arises because the code performs a `SELECT COUNT(*)` operation twice: once during a cache set operation to decide whether culling is needed and then again within the `_cull` method after removing expired entries to check if further culling is required.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\n- Optimize performance by reducing redundant database queries, specifically eliminating one of the two `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries made during cache updates.\n- Consider adjusting the culling frequency to potentially not cull on every set operation, mitigating performance hits from frequent culling on heavy cache write operations.\n\n### Analysis of `set` Method\n\nThis method is responsible for setting a value in the cache. Interestingly, from the provided code snippet, the actual count check (`SELECT COUNT(*)`) mentioned in the issue doesn't appear directly within the `set` method, implying the issue description refers to actions that occur deeper within the `_base_set` or related functions not directly visible in the provided snippet.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThough the direct code performing the count query isn't shown in the `set` snippet, the description indicates that it triggers a process that includes the counting of entries to determine the necessity of culling, starting from this entry point.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe `set` method should efficiently determine when to cull by possibly using an existing count passed to it or by reducing the frequency of cull checks to enhance performance.\n\n### Analysis of `_cull` Method\n\nThe `_cull` method directly references the concern raised in the issue. It performs culling based on the expiry of entries and then counts total entries to decide if further culling is necessary. This count is what the issue aims to optimize by suggesting the count result from before deletions be reused rather than querying the database again.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThis method encapsulates one of the two redundant `SELECT COUNT(*)` operations. Its current implementation directly impacts performance as identified in the issue because it counts all entries in the cache table post-deletion, a potentially expensive operation especially for large caches.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe `_cull` method's intended behavior after addressing the issue would be to cull the cache based on the pre-calculated count (adjusted by the number of deleted entries), thereby eliminating the need for a second count operation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo resolve the issue, the suggested changes involve:\n\n1. Passing the count of cache entries from the `set` operation (or wherever the initial count is determined) to the `_cull` method to avoid a second count operation.\n2. Revising the culling frequency strategy to reduce the performance impact, possibly by introducing a mechanism to control how often culling occurs based on configurable parameters or conditions (like every nth operation or randomly based on some criteria).\n\nThese proposed changes aim to enhance the performance of the `DatabaseCache` operations by reducing unnecessary database queries and optimizing the logic determining cull necessity."

This modification will use this passed-in count to avoid a redundant `SELECT COUNT(*)` after deleting expired entries. Instead of executing another count query (line 258), it should adjust the passed-in count by subtracting the number of deleted rows, obtained from `cursor.rowcount` immediately after the deletion operation (line 256-257). This approach ensures that the decision to perform further culling is based on the updated count without incurring the cost of another database query.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseCache`\n  - **Method(s):** Caller of `_cull` within `DatabaseCache` (Not directly identified in provided snippets but implied to be within `_base_set` and any cache set operation that eventually invokes `_cull`)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Any method in the `DatabaseCache` class that decides to invoke `_cull` based on the cache reaching or exceeding its `MAX_ENTRIES` limit should first perform the count of entries, then pass this count to `_cull`. Specifically, this could involve altering the logic within `set` or a method called by `set` (e.g., `_base_set`) to include a count of the cache entries before deciding to cull and then passing this count to `_cull`. This adjustment preserves the functionality of limiting the cache size while optimizing performance by reducing redundant COUNT queries. Additionally, the alteration might include a mechanism to throttle the frequency of culling operations based on a configurable setting or algorithm, potentially reducing the performance impact even further."
