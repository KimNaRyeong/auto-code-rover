        "intended_behavior": "The `_cull` method should be modified to accept an additional parameter representing the pre-cull count of cache entries. This modification will use this passed-in count to avoid a redundant `SELECT COUNT(*)` after deleting expired entries. Instead of executing another count query (line 258), it should adjust the passed-in count by subtracting the number of deleted rows, obtained from `cursor.rowcount` immediately after the deletion operation (line 256-257). This approach ensures that the decision to perform further culling is based on the updated count without incurring the cost of another database query."

        "method": "Caller of `_cull` within `DatabaseCache`",
        "intended_behavior": "Any method in the `DatabaseCache` class that decides to invoke `_cull` based on the cache reaching or exceeding its `MAX_ENTRIES` limit should first perform the count of entries, then pass this count to `_cull`. Specifically, this could involve altering the logic within `set` or a method called by `set` (e.g., `_base_set`) to include a count of the cache entries before deciding to cull and then passing this count to `_cull`. This adjustment preserves the functionality of limiting the cache size while optimizing performance by reducing redundant COUNT queries. Additionally, the alteration might include a mechanism to throttle the frequency of culling operations based on a configurable setting or algorithm, potentially reducing the performance impact even further."
