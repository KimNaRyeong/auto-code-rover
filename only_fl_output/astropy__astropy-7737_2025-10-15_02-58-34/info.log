20     r"""
21     Compute the biweight location.
22 
23     The biweight location is a robust statistic for determining the
24     central location of a distribution.  It is given by:
25 
26     .. math::
27 
28         \zeta_{biloc}= M + \frac{\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} \ (x_i - M) (1 - u_i^2)^2}
29             {\Sigma_{|u_i|<1} \ (1 - u_i^2)^2}
30 
31     where :math:`x` is the input data, :math:`M` is the sample median
32     (or the input initial location guess) and :math:`u_i` is given by:
33 
34     .. math::
35 
36         u_{i} = \frac{(x_i - M)}{c * MAD}
37 
38     where :math:`c` is the tuning constant and :math:`MAD` is the
39     `median absolute deviation
40     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation>`_.  The
41     biweight location tuning constant ``c`` is typically 6.0 (the
42     default).
43 
44     Parameters
45     ----------
46     data : array-like
47         Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
48     c : float, optional
49         Tuning constant for the biweight estimator (default = 6.0).
50     M : float or array-like, optional
51         Initial guess for the location.  If ``M`` is a scalar value,
52         then its value will be used for the entire array (or along each
53         ``axis``, if specified).  If ``M`` is an array, then its must be
54         an array containing the initial location estimate along each
55         ``axis`` of the input array.  If `None` (default), then the
56         median of the input array will be used (or along each ``axis``,
57         if specified).
58     axis : int, optional
59         The axis along which the biweight locations are computed.  If
60         `None` (default), then the biweight location of the flattened
61         input array will be computed.
62 
63     Returns
64     -------
65     biweight_location : float or `~numpy.ndarray`
66         The biweight location of the input data.  If ``axis`` is `None`
67         then a scalar will be returned, otherwise a `~numpy.ndarray`
68         will be returned.
