To accurately reproduce the issue you've mentioned and structure a Python script accordingly, we'll stick closer to the details provided. This time, ensure that `numpy` and `astropy` packages are installed in your environment, since the error message indicates a missing `numpy` module which is essential for this test. 

Please find below the improved standalone Python script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.stats import biweight_location

    # Testing `biweight_location` with a constant array
    test_array = np.ones(4)
    result = biweight_location(test_array)

    if not np.isnan(result):
        print("Issue not observed: `biweight_location` returned a non-NaN result for a constant array.")
    else:
        # This would be the expected path if the issue persists
        raise AssertionError("biweight_location of a constant array returns NaN instead of the expected value.")

except AssertionError as ae:
    print_stacktrace(ae)
except Exception as e:
    # Catching other potential errors (e.g., import errors) and printing their stack trace
    print_stacktrace(e)
```

Ensure that both `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in your Python environment. If they are not installed, you can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy astropy
```

This script is written to:
- Reproduce the reported issue where `biweight_location` returns `nan` for an array of constant values.
- Raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, indicating the bug is still there.
- Print a detailed stack trace for better diagnosis if an exception occurs.
- Confirm when the issue is not observed (outputting a success message).

Save this script as `reproducer.py` in your project's root directory and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. The execution should only raise an error and print a stack trace if the issue is present. If the issue is not observed (for instance, if a future update fixes this bug), it will print a message indicating the issue was not found.
