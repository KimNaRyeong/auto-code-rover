To better address the issue as described and to ensure we're executing the script in an environment where `pylint` is surely installed and accessible, we will adjust the script's approach. Specifically, we'll engage with `pylint` programmatically, by directly invoking its API within our Python script, rather than through subprocess. This way, we can closely monitor for exceptions related to unrecognized options and handle them accordingly.

Here's an enhanced version of the `reproducer.py` script tailored to programmatically checking for the issue directly by using `pylint`'s internal mechanisms. This script assumes that `pylint` is installed in the environment where this script runs.

```python
import sys
from pylint.lint import Run
from pylint.exceptions import UnknownMessageError

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def pylint_test_unrecognized_option():
    try:
        # Directly invoking pylint with a fake option `-Q` to simulate the unrecognized option scenario
        Run(['-Q'])
    except UnknownMessageError as e:
        print("Successfully caught the UnknownMessageError.")
        # If the exception is exactly what we're testing for, we pass the test.
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        # If no error occurred, it means pylint did not crash, but it also didn't recognize the option properly
        raise AssertionError("Pylint handled the unrecognized option silently, without raising an error.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pylint_test_unrecognized_option()
```

This script is much more direct in its approach to reproducing the issue. It:

1. Tries to run `pylint` programmatically with an unrecognized option (`-Q`),
2. Catches the `UnknownMessageError` which is the specific type of error we'd expect from passing an unrecognized option,
3. Utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to offer detailed error information if another type of exception occurs,
4. Exits with code 0 if the test passes (i.e., if the expected error is caught) or raises an exception otherwise.

This method ensures that the `pylint` command is accessed through the installed package within the Python environment, which should avoid the "No such file or directory" error encountered when attempting to use `subprocess` to call `pylint` without ensuring the command is available in the system's PATH.
