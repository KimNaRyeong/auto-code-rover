        "content": "To better understand the context and areas impacted by the changes mentioned in the issue, we need to gather some detailed information about the `sympy.stats` module, particularly focusing on various distributions and where checks or attributes may have been added or are missing. We can start by looking into the classes and methods related to distributions within the `sympy.stats` module. Given the lack of specific distribution names in the issue description, a broader approach is required.\n\n1. Let's start by searching for classes related to distributions to understand the structure:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Distribution\")\n```\n\n2. Since the `sympy.stats` module could contain different kinds of distributions (e.g., continuous, discrete), searching for more general terms might also be useful:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Continuous\")\nsearch_class(\"Discrete\")\n```\n\n3. To understand if there are common methods where checks could be missing or have been added, we should look for potentially relevant methods across distributions, such as parameter validation or attribute setting methods:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"check\")\nsearch_method(\"_set\")\n```\n\n4. Given the issue talks about enhancing consistency and correctness by adding missing checks and attributes, looking for code snippets that relate to parameter checks or attribute assignments in distributions could provide insight into the existing patterns and what might have been modified:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"check\")\nsearch_code(\"self.\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at exploring the structure of the `sympy.stats` module and identifying potential places where enhancements could be applied, based on the description provided in the issue. This should help in gathering enough context to further discuss and review the changes made for the mentioned issue."
