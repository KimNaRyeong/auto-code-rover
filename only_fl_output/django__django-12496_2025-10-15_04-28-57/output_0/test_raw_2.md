Given the requirements and the objective to effectively reproduce the issue while ensuring accurate context and problem diagnosis, hereâ€™s an approach using a more detailed and correctly ordered standalone script named `reproducer.py`. It incorporates the function to print stack traces, initialize Django settings before models are defined, and performs the necessary operations to simulate the scenario described.

```python
import os
import sys
import uuid
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connection
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup minimal Django environment
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
)

# Define models after Django setup
class Parent(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    title = models.TextField()

class Child(Parent):
    body = models.TextField()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

    try:
        # Attempt to create a Child instance
        Child.objects.create()
        # Check for unexpected UPDATE queries
        unexpected_updates = [
            q for q in connection.queries
            if 'UPDATE' in q['sql'].upper() and 'parent' in q['sql']
        ]
        assert not unexpected_updates, "Unexpected UPDATE queries found"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print('No issue detected.')
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script is structured to encapsulate the full environment setup within the scope of the executable script. This includes:

1. Configuring Django settings directly within the script to ensure a correct setup without relying on external configurations.
2. Defining simple `Parent` and `Child` models inline, where the `Parent` model has a custom UUID primary key.
3. Executing a Django migration command programmatically to prepare the in-memory database and then attempting to create an instance of the `Child` model, which implicitly creates a `Parent` entry due to Django's model inheritance.
4. Checking the SQL queries that have been executed to see if an undesirable `UPDATE` on the parent model is present amongst these. If such a query is detected, an `AssertionError` is raised. If any other unexpected error occurs, it's caught and printed alongside a stack trace for diagnostic purposes.
5. Exiting with a status code that reflects the outcome of the test, where code 0 indicates success (no issue found) and code 1 indicates failure (either the specific issue was detected or an unexpected error occurred).

Note: Execute this script within a Django-compatible environment where Django is installed and the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is not required to be set since settings are configured programmatically.
