This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3.

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the described issue, we will need to explore the models' definitions, their inheritance mechanism, and any related save or create methods that might be involved in triggering the extra query behavior when a custom primary key is used. The issue specifically mentions the behavior during object creation for models utilizing multi-inheritance and a custom primary key field. We'll focus our search on the classes `Parent` and `Child`, and any custom save/create methods that might be interacting with the database.\n\n1. Find the `Parent` and `Child` classes to understand how they are defined and if there are any custom methods that might influence the creation process:\n   - `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Child\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an extra query during object creation, it's relevant to look for overridden save methods in these models which could be where the logic causing the extra query resides:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`\n\n3. The issue also mentions the use of a custom primary key (`UUIDField`) in the `Parent` class which is crucial to the problem. It would be useful to find its definition:\n   - `search_code(\"models.UUIDField\")`\n\n4. Lastly, investigating if the Django version or the database (PostgreSQL) has specific known issues or optimizations regarding multi-table inheritance with custom primary keys could also be helpful. This step would involve external research outside the codebase so it won't be represented by an API call here.\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary information to understand how the models and their creation process are implemented, and potentially pinpoint where the extra query is being triggered from."

This could imply the classes were not indexed correctly, or perhaps the naming might be different than expected. It's also possible that these models are dynamically defined or created in a manner that's not straightforward to index.\n   \n2. **Searching for the `save` method in both classes:**\n   - Similar to the first search, this attempt also did not yield any results, reinforcing the notion that either the `Parent` and `Child` classes are not directly accessible by the search or they are defined in a non-traditional way that the indexing can't capture.\n\n3. **Searching for code snippets containing `models.UUIDField`:**\n   - The two snippets found are not directly related to the definition of `Parent` or `Child` classes or any custom save method implementation. Instead, they show where `models.UUIDField` is mentioned in the context of Django's GIS utilities and admin options configuration. This does not directly relate to the bug but gives us insight into how `UUIDField` is recognized as a field type within Django's ecosystem, specifically in utility and widget configurations.\n\nGiven this analysis, we need to redirect our strategy to:\n- Look for any possible custom save or creation methods that might not be directly tied to the `Parent` or `Child` class names but are involved in the creation process within multi-inheritance model scenarios.\n- Consider searching for key Django model lifecycle methods or signals such as `pre_save`, `post_save`, or methods related to model instantiation and saving that could interact with inheritance and primary keys differently when a custom primary key is used.\n\nNext steps based on current analysis:\n1. Since the model classes were not found directly, it might be beneficial to look into how the models are being saved or created more generally within the Django application. This could lead to insights into where the extra query might be generated from.\n\n2. Given the UUIDField context found, we could try to understand any custom behaviors or configurations in the Django project that might lead to the observed issue, although so far, we have not directly identified such a mechanism. \n\n3. It's also worth searching for model creation or saving related signals or methods that could give us more direct insight into the issue:\n   - `search_method(\"save\")` to see if there are any custom implementations or overrides of the save method that might influence this behavior.\n   - `search_method(\"create\")` because the issue occurs during object creation, looking for potential custom create methods might provide some insights.\n  \nWithout direct access to the classes and methods described in the issue, these broadened searches aim to capture the surrounding context that might influence the observed behavior."
