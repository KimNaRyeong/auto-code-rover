        "intended_behavior": "The save method should be optimized to check for the existence of a custom primary key during the creation of model instances, particularly in multi-table inheritance scenarios. If a custom primary key is present, Django should insert the parent and child records in one operation where possible and avoid any unnecessary update queries that set fields to empty values immediately after the insert. The method should handle both cases (with and without custom primary keys) efficiently, without hindering the performance or functionality for other model instances."

        "intended_behavior": "The create method should specifically ensure that when a new object is instantiated via multi-table inheritance, all fields from the parent and child models are correctly populated before the initial save. It should circumvent any extra updates to the parent model fields when a custom primary key is used. Ensuring that the creation process is atomic and efficient when custom primary keys are involved, without requiring an additional update step, is crucial."
