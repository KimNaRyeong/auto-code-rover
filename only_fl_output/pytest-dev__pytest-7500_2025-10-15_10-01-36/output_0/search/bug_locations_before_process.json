The change aims to reduce the likelihood of encountering PermissionError by potentially removing directories in an intermediate state first. The intent is to ensure that the cleanup process is more resilient against timing issues related to the file system state under different loads. This modification should retain all existing functionality of the cleanup process, ensuring only the order of operations is affected."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhancement of the try_cleanup method to include better error handling for PermissionError specifically under Windows. This could involve implementing a retry mechanism or introducing a delay before a retry to handle cases where the operating system has not completed its cleanup operations. This change aims to make the cleanup process more robust and reduce the likelihood of failing due to temporary file system states. It's crucial that this adjusted behavior does not negatively impact the effectiveness of cleanup operations under normal conditions."
