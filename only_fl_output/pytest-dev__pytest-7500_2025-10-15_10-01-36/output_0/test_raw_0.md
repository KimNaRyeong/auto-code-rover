Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to reproduce the issue mentioned. This script simulates the conditions under which the `PermissionError` arises while cleaning up temporary directories by *pytest* on Windows. It attempts to create a scenario where cleaning up temporary directories triggers the error due to lingering locks or file access issues, reflecting the problem described.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
import time
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_pytest_cleanup(tmpdir_path: Path):
    # Simulate creation of numerous temporary directories
    for _ in range(5):
        temp_dir = tmpdir_path / tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=tmpdir_path)
        lock_file = temp_dir / ".lock"
        lock_file.touch()

    try:
        # Attempt to clean up one of the directories to simulate pytest's behavior
        for temp_dir in tmpdir_path.iterdir():
            if temp_dir.is_dir() and ".lock" in [p.name for p in temp_dir.iterdir()]:
                shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
                assert not temp_dir.exists(), f"Directory {temp_dir} was not successfully removed."

        print("Issue not reproduced. Temporary directories cleaned up successfully.")
        return True  # Indicates successful cleanup for this simulation
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False  # Indicates cleanup failure, simulating the issue

def main():
    # Create a base temporary directory to work within
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
        tmpdir_path = Path(tmpdirname)
        # Simulate pytest cleanup to trigger the PermissionError
        result = simulate_pytest_cleanup(tmpdir_path)
        assert result, "The PermissionError issue was reproduced."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate successful execution (without reproducing the issue)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit code 1 to indicate the issue was successfully reproduced
```

This script closely follows the error scenario described, emphasizing the cleanup process of temporary directories under conditions (like load and pre-existing temporary files) that could result in access denial due to lingering system locks or similar issues. When executed, it should reproduce the `PermissionError` if the conditions are right, namely if pytest (or in this case, our emulation of its cleanup process) encounters locked files or directories it cannot remove. For the purpose of this script, we're simulating the creation and cleanup of temporary directories, and checking whether any `PermissionError` is observed, specifically simulating the way pytest might interact with the filesystem in a point where it encountered a similar error.
