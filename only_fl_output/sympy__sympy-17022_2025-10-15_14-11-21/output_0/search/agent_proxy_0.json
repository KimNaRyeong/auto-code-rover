            "content": "To address the issue regarding `lambdify` misinterpreting matrix expressions, specifically the misinterpretation of identity matrices and the incorrect handling due to the symbol `I` being seen as a complex number, we need to explore several aspects of the codebase. These include the `lambdify` function itself, how matrices are handled within `lambdify`, and potentially how symbols (like `I` for the identity matrix) are printed or interpreted when converting expressions to numpy arrays. We'll execute a series of API calls to gather this context:\n\n- Investigate the `lambdify` function to understand how it processes expressions:\n  - `search_method(\"lambdify\")`\n\n- Determine how identity matrices are supposed to be printed or handled by `lambdify`, which might involve the printing mechanism for symbols or special cases for matrices:\n  - `search_code(\"Identity\")`\n  \n- Explore how the symbol `I` is being interpreted to rule out or understand any misinterpretations related to complex numbers:\n  - `search_code(\"I\")`  \n\nThese API calls aim to gather comprehensive insight into how `lambdify` works, especially regarding matrix operations and symbol interpretation, to pinpoint the source of the issue and prepare for crafting an effective patch."
