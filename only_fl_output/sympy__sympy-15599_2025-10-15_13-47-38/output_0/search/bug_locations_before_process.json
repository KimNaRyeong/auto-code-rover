        "intended_behavior": "The method should incorporate a logic that simplifies `Mod(3*i, 2)` to `Mod(i, 2)` by recognizing that factors in the numerator which do not affect the modulo result (especially in contexts involving moduli that are factors of those in the numerator) can be safely omitted. This requires adding a pre-evaluation step or modifying existing conditions to specifically check for and handle such cases where the numerator's factors (like 3 in the given example) can be removed without changing the modulo operation's outcome. The change must ensure that this simplification does not interfere with or mistakenly apply to cases where such factor removal would alter the result, thus preserving the existing functionality and correctness of the code."
