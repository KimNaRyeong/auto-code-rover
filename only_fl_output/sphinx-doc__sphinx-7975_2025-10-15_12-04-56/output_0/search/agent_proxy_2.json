The code should introduce a refined logic to:\n   - Ensure all symbols are consistently recognized and processed to belong to a single \"Symbols\" section, regardless of their sort order or Unicode representation. This can be achieved by modifying the condition that leads to the return of _('Symbols'), possibly by enhancing how the initial character of an entry is evaluated.\n   - Maintain the existing functionality for categorizing alphabetical and underscore characters, preserving the categorization of these entries as currently implemented.\n   - Implement a check to distinguish all symbol characters from alphanumeric ones, and group them under a single \"Symbols\" heading effectively. This could involve creating a more inclusive check for symbols before deciding to categorize an entry under \"Symbols\", ensuring that symbols are not inadvertently split into multiple sections based on their appearance in the sort order.\n\nThis modification will address the issue by ensuring that index generation treats all symbol entries uniformly, preventing the creation of multiple \"Symbols\" sections in the output."
