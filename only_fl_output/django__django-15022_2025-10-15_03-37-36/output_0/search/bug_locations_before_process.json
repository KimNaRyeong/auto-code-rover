        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location should efficiently handle search queries without generating an unnecessary number of JOINs for each word in the search query. One possible approach is to optimize queryset filtering logic by: Aggregating search terms to minimize the number of queries. Using more efficient database operations that can handle multiple search terms without resorting to additional JOINs for each term. This might involve conditional expressions or a more sophisticated query construction strategy that leverages Django's ORM capabilities. Implementing a pre-filter step to narrow down the result set before applying more complex filters that might include JOINs, potentially through the use of Q objects for complex lookups. Considering the use of database-specific full-text search capabilities, which might be more efficient for this use case. The overall goal is to preserve the existing functionality that allows admin users to search across multiple fields and related models but do so in a way that does not degrade performance as the number of terms in the search query increases. This requires a careful balance between flexibility and efficiency in the query construction process."
