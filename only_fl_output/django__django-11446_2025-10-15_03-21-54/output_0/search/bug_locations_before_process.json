        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that, in cases where a `404.html` template does not exist or is not specified, the fallback content it generates should be a properly formed HTML document. Right now, it generates a minimal content with just an `h1` and a `p` tag. This should be wrapped within a standard HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Not Found</title></head><body>...</body></html>`) to ensure the output is a correctly formed HTML document. This modification preserves the method's existing functionality by still providing a default error message when a specific `404.html` template is not found or provided, but enhances it by ensuring the result is a complete HTML page, thus addressing the issue reported."
