        "intended_behavior": "The method needs an additional condition or adjustment to its existing conditions specifically in the part where it classifies equations as 'general_sum_of_even_powers'. The verification should not only check if all powers are even (as it currently does around lines 404-407) but also ensure that these powers are identical across all terms that involve variables. This can be done by collecting all the exponents of the terms, ensuring they are even, and then verifying that this set of exponents has only one unique value (indicating that all powers are indeed the same). This change will prevent misclassification of equations where the terms have even but different powers. Furthermore, this refinement must preserve the method's ability to classify a wide variety of Diophantine equation types accurately without affecting its performance or the accuracy for other equation types."
