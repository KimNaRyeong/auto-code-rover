For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the issue description, we need to find the current implementation of how merge migrations filenames are created. Since the description mentions improving the default name of merge migrations and includes an example filename `0003_merge_20160102_0304.py`, it suggests that there's a specific method or function responsible for generating these filenames within the migration system.\n\nTo get the necessary context for resolving this issue, we should look into the migration system, specifically focusing on how filenames for merge migrations are generated. The likely places to contain this logic could be within a class or method related to migration creation or handling. \n\nGiven this, the following API calls will help us locate the relevant code:\n\n1. **Search for a method that might be responsible for generating migration filenames**: Since the naming convention is specific, there might be a dedicated method for this. We can start by searching for any method that sounds like it could be responsible for this functionality. However, without explicit method names from the issue, we can guess common names related to the functionality.\n   \n   - `search_method(\"generate_migration_filename\")`\n   - `search_method(\"create_merge_filename\")`\n\n2. **Search for a class that handles migrations**: Migrations are a major part of any system that requires versioning of database schemas, so there is likely a class dedicated to handling these operations. From there, we can inspect methods related to merge migration naming.\n\n   - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationCreator\")`\n\n3. **Search for code snippets that might show how filenames are generated**: There might be specific lines of code where the filename is concatenated or formed. Searching for code snippets that involve filenames and merging could surface the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n   - `search_code(\"merge_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"_merge_\")`\n\nThese calls can provide a good starting point by highlighting the parts of the codebase that deal with migration naming, especially merge migrations. Once we locate the relevant methods or classes, we can delve deeper into the implementation details and plan out how to enhance the filename generation process based on the issue's suggestion."
