        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the code at the identified location(s) within makemigrations.py that generates filenames for merge migrations needs to be modified. The current behavior generates names based on a timestamp, producing filenames like 0003_merge_20160102_0304.py. The intended behavior is to generate more descriptive filenames that reflect the migrations being merged. This can mean: - Combining the names (or specific identifiers) of the files being merged into the filename, for instance 0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py. - Ensure that the new naming convention does not introduce issues with filename length limits on certain filesystems or compatibility issues within Django's migration system. - Preserve existing functionality for generating non-merge migration filenames to ensure that only merge migration naming logic is altered. - Incorporate a method to dynamically generate these filenames based on the migrations involved in the merge. This approach should consider the readability of the generated names and possibly include a logic to prevent excessively long filenames by abbreviating or summarizing the involved migrations when necessary."
