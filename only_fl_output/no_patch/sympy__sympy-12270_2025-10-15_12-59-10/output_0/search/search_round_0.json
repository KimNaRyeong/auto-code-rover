Search for the `expr.py` file to find relevant classes and methods related to the issue.\n2. Search for the `Mul` class as it's directly mentioned in relation to the bug.\n3. Search for the `primitive` method within the context of the issue, as it appears crucial to the problem.\n4. Search for the `extract_multiplicatively` method in the entire codebase since it's central to the bug.\n5. Search for the specific code snippet `Mul(2, -x).extract_multiplicatively(-2)` and `Mul(2, -x, evaluate=False).extract_multiplicatively(-2)` as they illustrate the bug.\n6. Given the mention of a specific commit `8968b85310506c0a2b34f3d7aeb8e0d88f87885b`, it would be imperative to check changes in `core/expr.py` related to this commit, however, since this tool doesn't support searching by commit references directly, we'll focus on the available API calls.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Mul\")`\n- `search_method(\"primitive\")`\n- `search_method(\"extract_multiplicatively\")`\n- `search_code(\"Mul(2, -x).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\")`\n- `search_code(\"Mul(2, -x, evaluate=False).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\")`"
