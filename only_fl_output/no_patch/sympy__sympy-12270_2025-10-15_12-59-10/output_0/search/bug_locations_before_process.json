        "intended_behavior": "The `extract_multiplicatively` method needs to correctly accommodate scenarios where negative factors are being extracted from expressions, which may include negative terms themselves. The method should recognize when an entire expression can effectively be 'divided' by a negative factor, returning the simplified expression that includes the proper handling of negation. This means improving the logic to ensure that when attempting to extract, for example, `-2` from `(-2*x - 2*y - 8)`, it should result in `x + y + 4` as opposed to returning `None`. This involves ensuring the division by c within the method accounts for negative values both in the coefficient and in the symbol terms properly. This adjustment must not disrupt the method's current capability to handle positive factors and expressions, preserving backward compatibility and the current feature set for positive extractions and other general cases."
