This would involve enabling the method to evaluate conditions or parameters at runtime to determine the expiry date, with the ability for developers to customize this logic. The basic functionality, which defaults to using settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE when no explicit expiry is set, should remain as the fallback scenario."
