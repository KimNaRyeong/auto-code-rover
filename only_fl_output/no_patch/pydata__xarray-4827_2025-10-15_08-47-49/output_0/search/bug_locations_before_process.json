To resolve the issue, the method(s) within this file that implement the combine_attrs logic must be extended to include a new option, drop_conflicts (or matching, as suggested). The intended behavior here is to iterate over the attributes of the objects being merged, compare them, and for any attribute with conflicting values (i.e., same name but different values), those attributes should be silently dropped instead of raising an error or including them in the merged object. This functionality preserves existing options (drop, identical, no_conflicts, override) while adding the new behavior as an additional choice for users."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that this file also deals with handling combine_attrs in the context of combining datasets, it's necessary to include the new drop_conflicts option here too. Any functionality that merges datasets and uses or refers to combine_attrs would need to be updated to recognize and correctly implement the new drop_conflicts logic. Similar to merge.py, this involves comparing attributes for conflicts and excluding any conflicting pairs from the result. The updated behavior must integrate seamlessly with existing combine operations, enabling users to choose the new drop_conflicts option for their combine operations."
