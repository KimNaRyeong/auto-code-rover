        "intended_behavior": "The `get_field` method needs to be adjusted to only convert the field name `_order` to the one defined in `options['order_with_respect_to']` if `order_with_respect_to` is explicitly set within the model's Meta options. This modification ensures that models with an `_order` field but not utilizing `order_with_respect_to` will not cause a `KeyError`. The check for `order_with_respect_to` should be more defensive, ensuring that the method remains stable and operates correctly regardless of the specific model configuration regarding the `_order` field. The updated implementation should preserve the existing functionality for models that do use `order_with_respect_to` while preventing crashes for those that do not. This involves checking the presence of `order_with_respect_to` in `self.options` before attempting to use it as a key to retrieve the field name."
