Given the error encountered during the previous execution, it seems there was an issue related to the `packaging` module not being available in the testing environment. Before we proceed with another test script, ensure that all dependencies, including `packaging`, are correctly installed in the environment. This can often be done using pip, for example:

```bash
pip install packaging
```

Moving forward with the assumption that the environment is correctly set up, below is an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py`. This adjustment reuses the initial code but takes into consideration the possibility of an environment where earlier issues, such as missing dependencies, have been resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_angle_pickle_to_string():
    import astropy.coordinates
    import pickle
    ang = astropy.coordinates.Angle(0.25 * astropy.units.hourangle)
    pang = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(ang))
    try:
        original_string = ang.to_string()
        unpickled_string = pang.to_string()
        assert original_string == unpickled_string, "Unpickled Angle.to_string fails"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_angle_pickle_to_string()
        print("Test passed.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test failed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

Ensure that `astropy` and its dependencies, including `packaging` if necessary, are installed in your Python environment. The script should now properly reproduce the issue described, assuming the problem persists in the current setup, and environmental issues have been addressed.
