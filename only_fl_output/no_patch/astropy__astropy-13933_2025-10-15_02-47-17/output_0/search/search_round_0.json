        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I propose using the following search API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `Angle` class to understand its structure and the relevant methods it contains.\n   - `search_class(\"Angle\")`\n\n2. Search for the `to_string` method within the `Angle` class since the issue specifically mentions that this method fails after unpickling.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"to_string\", \"Angle\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue occurs after pickling and unpickling, it's also important to understand how the `Angle` object is being serialized and deserialized. This means we might need to look into any custom `__reduce__` methods within the `Angle` class if they exist, as these are commonly used for pickling.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"Angle\")`\n\n4. Lastly, the error message cites an inability to represent 'hourangle' in sexagesimal notation. It would be useful to search for where and how the 'hourangle' units are handled in the codebase to see if there's a point where the representation information is lost or mishandled after unpickling.\n   - `search_code(\"hourangle\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context surrounding the serialization/deserialization process, the handling of the 'hourangle' unit, and how `to_string` works, which are all relevant to resolving the issue."
