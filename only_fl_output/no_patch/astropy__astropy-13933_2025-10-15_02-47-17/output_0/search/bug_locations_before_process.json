        "intended_behavior": "The `to_string` method should robustly convert `Angle` objects into their string representations, even after these objects have been pickled and unpickled. This includes correctly handling all units associated with `Angle` objects, such as `hourangle` and `degree`, ensuring they can be represented in sexagesimal notation when requested. The method needs to ensure that the unit preservation mechanism works flawlessly across pickling cycles, meaning that if an `Angle` object was initialized or set with a specific unit that can be represented in sexagesimal notation (e.g., `hourangle`), this capability should persist through serialization and deserialization. If the underlying issue stems from how the `hourangle` unit's representation or identification is handled post-unpickling, a review and potential adjustment of how units are maintained could be necessary. Ensuring that `unit` property restoration is accurate during the unpickling process would resolve the reported error."
