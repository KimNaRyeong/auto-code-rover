        "intended_behavior": "The `isqrt` function should accurately return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, without the inaccuracies introduced by the limitations of floating-point arithmetic for large numbers close to floating-point precision limits. To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should involve:\n\n- Re-evaluating and possibly adjusting the threshold from `17984395633462800708566937239552` to a safer boundary that accurately reflects the limits of floating-point precision (potentially adjusting it to `4503599761588224` or `2**52 + 2**27` as suggested in the issue analysis).\n- Introducing a post-processing verification step that checks if the returned square root, when squared, is greater than `n`. If it is, decrement the result by 1 to ensure it fits the condition `s**2 <= n`.\n- Alternatively, the method's condition for using `math.sqrt` could be refined to ensure it only applies within a bound guaranteed to preserve accuracy, given the limitations of floating-point arithmetic. This might involve a more conservative estimate of where floating-point precision is reliable, based on the assumption of IEEE 754 binary64 format for Python floats and the accuracy of `math.sqrt` across different platforms.\n- It may also be prudent to include a more direct fallback or adjustment within the computational path that uses `math.sqrt`, ensuring that edge cases near the boundary of floating-point precision are correctly handled, potentially through checking and correcting the result before returning it. This ensures that the function's behavior remains consistent and accurate across the full range of possible input values.\n\nThese adjustments aim to maintain the efficiency of the method for smaller values of `n` while ensuring its accuracy and reliability for larger inputs, directly addressing the discrepancies raised in the bug report."
