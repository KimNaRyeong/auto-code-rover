        "content": "To address the issue outlined, we need to understand how Q objects handle the `|` operator and what leads to the \"TypeError: cannot pickle\" error when using a non-picklable type like `dict_keys` in a Q object. The main areas of interest would be the Q class implementation, especially how it handles operations like `|`, and any serialization or pickling logic involved, which could be implicated in the error when attempting to use or combine Q objects in this way. Here are the API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_class(\"Q\")`: This call is to find the file or files where the Q class is defined. Since the issue revolves around the Q object, understanding its implementation will provide insights into why the error occurs.\n  \n- `search_method(\"__or__\")`: We need to understand how the Q class implements the `|` operator, which is typically done through the `__or__` method in Python. This will help us see if there's something specific in the `__or__` implementation that leads to the pickling error.\n\n- `search_code(\"pickle\")`: This is a more general search to find any mentions of \"pickle\" or serialization logic within the codebase. Since the error specifically complains about an inability to pickle a `dict_keys` object, any code handling serialization might be relevant to solving this issue. \n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how Q objects and the | operator work, and potentially why using `dict_keys` with them leads to a TypeError."
