        "intended_behavior": "The `__or__` method should be enhanced to check if it is handling non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys` when combining `Q` objects. Before performing operations that might involve pickling (implicitly, through the use of | operator), non-pickleable types should be converted to pickleable types, such as converting `dict_keys` to a list. This adjustment ensures that the operation does not trigger a `TypeError` due to an attempt to pickle an inherently non-pickleable object. This change must preserve the logical OR operation's outcome between `Q` objects, ensuring that the query semantics are unaffected while avoiding pickling errors."
