After locating the class, we may need to look into the specific methods or parts of the implementation that are relevant for explaining how it maps to a uniform distribution or any distribution. Typically, methods like `fit`, `transform` or any method that computes empirical cdf if it's not done in an obvious way. Without knowing the exact method names yet, we'll wait for the results from the first call to pinpoint relevant methods. \n\n3. **Search for code snippets that might be directly implementing the empirical cdf or any transformation logic,** because the issue mentions a misinterpretation regarding the use of empirical cdf for mapping to a uniform distribution.\n   - `search_code(\"empirical cdf\")`\n   - `search_code(\"map to a uniform distribution\")`\n\nThe result from the first call will guide us to the file or files where we can direct more specific search calls, especially if we need to look at the implementation details of specific methods within the `QuantileTransformer` class."
