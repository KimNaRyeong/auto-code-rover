This might look like Interval(start, end, left_open, right_open), taking into account the values of start, end, left_open, and right_open. This change must preserve the intuitiveness and clarity of the representation while ensuring it adheres to the \"str(object) is valid code to create object\" principle. Care must be taken to address cases with infinity boundaries and boolean flags for open and closed ends."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, modify or implement the __str__ method for FiniteSet such that calling str() on a FiniteSet instance returns a string that is valid Python code for recreating the object, like FiniteSet(1, 2, 3). This approach should dynamically handle the number of members in the set, ensuring that the output string correctly represents the set, regardless of its size. This method should maintain the clarity of the set's representation while aligning with the principle that the string output can be used directly to recreate the object."
