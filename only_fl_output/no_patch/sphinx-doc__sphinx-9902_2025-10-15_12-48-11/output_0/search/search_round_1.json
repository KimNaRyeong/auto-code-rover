Since we know that the `Unit` class is imported from `.module2`, it is possible that its definition or relevant documentation is not directly exposed in a way that the search API recognizes, or the documentation syntax may vary slightly.\n\nGiven these considerations, it would be helpful to attempt a more targeted search based on the information provided in the issue description, specifically focusing on the `.module2` file where the `Unit` class is expected to be defined, and any documentation-specific files or configurations that might be influencing how Sphinx processes `.. py:data::` directives and type links. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Search for the `Unit` class within a specific module**: Because the `Unit` class is mentioned to be imported from `.module2`, searching within that specific module could yield better results. \n   - Since the exact filename wasn't specified, an assumption has to be made about its name based on standard Python naming conventions. If `.module2` refers to a file, it is likely named `module2.py` within a package named `my_library`.\n   \n2. **Explore the Sphinx configuration file**: The way Sphinx handles links to types could be influenced by project-wide settings or extensions in use, which are typically specified in a `conf.py` file in the documentation directory.\n   - Given this context, locating usage of Sphinx-specific configurations or directives in the `conf.py` file or similar might provide clues on why the expected linking behavior isn't occurring.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following API calls can be made to gather the necessary context for resolving the issue:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Unit\", \"module2.py\")`: This call aims to find the definition of the `Unit` class within the expected module file.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\", \"conf.py\")`: This attempts to examine how `sphinx.ext.autodoc` or other relevant Sphinx extensions are configured, which might affect the rendering and linking of documentation types. \n\nThese targeted searches should help in understanding both the structure of the `Unit` class and any Sphinx configuration nuances that could be affecting the linking of types in the documentation."

This could involve ensuring that the `Unit` class is properly imported and referenced within the Sphinx configuration or documentation files, allowing for the simplified type referencing.\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** Documentation configuration, potentially `conf.py` or related Sphinx setup files within the `docs` directory.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The Sphinx setup must be configured or modified to correctly interpret and link types specified in the `.. py:data::` directive using only the class name when the class has been imported into the module. This could involve tweaking autodoc settings, intersphinx mappings, or other Sphinx extensions that manage domain objects and references. Specifically, ensuring that Sphinx's autodoc extension can resolve short names to their full canonical paths for linking purposes, possibly through custom extensions or event handlers that enrich type information during the documentation build process.\n\n**General Resolution Strategy:**\n- To address the linking issue, it may be necessary to extend or modify the Sphinx configuration to more intelligently resolve class names to their full paths based on the project's structure and imports. This might involve writing a custom Sphinx extension or contributing a patch to an existing extension that handles type links more flexibly.\n- Reviewing and possibly enhancing the documentation comments within the codebase to ensure they are compatible with Sphinx's expected formats and behaviors, paying particular attention to how classes (like `Unit`) are referenced across documentation blocks.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors aim to provide a guide towards resolving the issue of types not being correctly linked in the Sphinx-generated documentation without needing to specify full module paths."
