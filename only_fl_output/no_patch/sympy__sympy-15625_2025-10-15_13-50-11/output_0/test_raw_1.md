It seems there was a syntax error in the previously provided code snippet due to a missing closing parenthesis. Let's correct this and ensure the script properly raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed. Below is the corrected `reproducer.py` script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_nbconvert_latex_issue():
    import nbformat
    from nbconvert import PDFExporter
    from traitlets.config import Config

    # Create a notebook programmatically
    nb = nbformat.v4.new_notebook()
    nb.cells.append(nbformat.v4.new_code_cell("""
import sympy as sp
sp.init_printing()
1
    """))

    # Configure PDFExporter to not execute the cells
    c = Config()
    c.PDFExporter.execute = False

    # Export notebook to LaTeX, then PDF (simulation)
    pdf_exporter = PDFExporter(config=c)
    body, _ = pdf_exporter.from_notebook_node(nb)

    # Check for the incorrect LaTeX wrapping presence
    incorrect_wrapping = "$$\\begin{equation*}"
    if incorrect_wrapping in body:
        raise AssertionError("Incorrect LaTeX wrapping detected.")

    print("Issue not present. Test passed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_nbconvert_latex_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero when the issue is present implies failing the test
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)  # Exit with zero when the test passes (i.e., the issue is fixed)
```

This script fulfills the criteria:
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the incorrect LaTeX wrapping is present.
- Exits with code 1 when the issue is not fixed (i.e., test fails).
- Exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., test passes).

Please ensure that `nbformat` and `nbconvert` packages are installed in your Python environment before running this script.
