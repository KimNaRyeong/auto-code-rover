        "intended_behavior": "The `latex` method should correctly handle the output formatting in `equation` or `equation*` mode without wrapping it with additional `$$` symbols when it is unnecessary. The `mode` parameter's handling needs to ensure that when expressions are set to be displayed in these modes, they are treated as being in LaTeX math mode by default and thus do not require the additional `$$` wrapping. This adjustment should preserve the method's current functionality while fixing the LaTeX output issue when converting Jupyter notebooks to LaTeX or PDF formats. Specifically, the check surrounding the usage of `$$` (related to the `itex` flag or when setting the `mode`) should be refined to exclude cases where the expression is already meant to be in a math environment (`equation` or `equation*` modes). This ensures that the output LaTeX is valid and can be processed without errors by LaTeX compilers."
