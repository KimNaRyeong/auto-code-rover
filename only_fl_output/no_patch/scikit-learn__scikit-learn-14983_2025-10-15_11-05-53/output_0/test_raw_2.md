Based on your request to reproduce the issue involving the incorrect `__repr__` string returned by `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` in scikit-learn, and then to utilize a specific function to print the stack trace of the issue, the following `reproducer.py` file is crafted. This script checks if the representations (`__repr__`) of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` are as expected. If not, it raises an `AssertionError` and uses the provided function to print a detailed stack trace.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    
    # Instantiating the objects
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()
    
    # Generating the repr strings for comparison
    rkf_repr = repr(rkf)
    rskf_repr = repr(rskf)
    
    # Expected results
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    
    try:
        assert rkf_repr == expected_rkf_repr, f"AssertionError: RepeatedKFold __repr__ mismatch. Expected: {expected_rkf_repr}, Got: {rkf_repr}"
        assert rskf_repr == expected_rskf_repr, f"AssertionError: RepeatedStratifiedKFold __repr__ mismatch. Expected: {expected_rskf_repr}, Got: {rskf_repr}"
        print("Test passed. The __repr__ strings are as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
- Imports the necessary classes from `sklearn.model_selection`.
- Instantiates the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` and fetches their representations.
- Compares the obtained representations with the expected strings.
- If the actual representations do not match the expected strings, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace using the given `print_stacktrace` function.
- If the issue is fixed, and the representations match the expectations, it prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0. 

This script should be placed in the root directory of your project and can be executed with Python 3 to check for the presence of the reported issue.
