        "intended_behavior": "This method should include logic to specifically check if the function being printed is the 'sign' function. If so, it should generate code according to Fortran syntax rules for the 'sign' function. More specifically, when the 'sign' function is encountered, the method should generate code in the form of 'sign(1, x)' or 'sign(1d0, x)', with the choice between '1' or '1d0' depending on whether 'x' is an integer or floating-point number, respectively. This ensures that the generated Fortran code is syntactically correct and matches the expected behavior of the 'sign' function in Fortran. This change must keep other function translations intact, only adding special handling for 'sign'."
