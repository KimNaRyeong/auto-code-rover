This script is designed to explicitly check for incorrect Fortran code generation by Sympy for the sign function, specifically when it generates `sign(x)` instead of a correct variation like `sign(1, x)` or `sign(1d0, x)`. If the script encounters the incorrect `sign(x)` output, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating the issue, and then uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to output the details of the error. If no error is raised (implying a fix has been implemented), it prints a message saying the issue has been addressed and exits with code 0.
