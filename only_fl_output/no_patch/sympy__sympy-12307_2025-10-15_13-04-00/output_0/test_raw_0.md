This script checks for the specific issue of incorrect Fortran code being generated by the `sympy.fcode` function for `sp.sign(x)`. It tests whether the generated code matches the expected Fortran syntax for the sign function â€” which it should be, according to valid Fortran syntax rules like `sign(1, x)` or `sign(1d0, x)` for an integer or floating-point context, respectively. If the generated code is incorrect (i.e., `sign(x)`), the script raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. If the issue has been resolved, and the generated code matches the expected output, the script will complete successfully, indicating that the issue has been fixed.
