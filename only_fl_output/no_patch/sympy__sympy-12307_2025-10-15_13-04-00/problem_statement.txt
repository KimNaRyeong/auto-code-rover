Codegen: sign function in Fortran
The Fortran code generated by Sympy for the sign function is not a valid Fortran syntax.

With Sympy 1.0 and Python 3.6:
```python
In [1]: import sympy as sp

In [2]: from sympy.abc import x

In [3]: sp.fcode(sp.sign(x))
Out[3]: '      sign(x)'
```
(The same behavior is obtained with `sympy.utilities.codegen`.)

The syntax of the sign function in Fortran is given [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/SIGN.html).

I guess it would be preferable to generate something like `sign(1, x)` or `sign(1d0, x)` depending of the context. I'm not sure how to get the same behavior than Sympy for `x=0`, but at least it would be compilable.
