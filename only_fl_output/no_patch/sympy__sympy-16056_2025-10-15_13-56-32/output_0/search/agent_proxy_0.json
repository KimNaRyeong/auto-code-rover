We will target three main objectives:\n\n1. **Identify where these commands are used**: Since we know the commands, we can search for the code snippets directly to see in which files and contexts they are utilized.\n2. **Determine the current mechanism for printing text in LaTeX routines**: If there's an existing centralized mechanism or several scattered implementations for printing text in LaTeX format.\n3. **Explore the possibility of adding a helper function**: We need to understand the current structure to integrate a new helper function seamlessly.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n1. `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\mathrm\")`: This will help us identify all occurrences of `\\mathrm` in the codebase to see how and where it's used.\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\text\")`: Similarly, this will locate all instances of `\\text` to compare and contrast its usage against `\\mathrm`.\n3. `search_method(method_name: \"print_text\")`: Although it seems there isn't a `print_text` method yet, this call will verify if any similar naming convention exists, possibly avoiding conflicts or redundancy.\n4. `search_code(code_str: \"amsmath\")`: This will help to see if the `amsmath` package is widely used or mentioned, which could influence the decision on standardization."
