Given the specific requirements for the `reproducer.py` script to emphasize when the issue is present and exit normally when it is not, let's adjust the previous script accordingly. This new version will compare the dtype explicitly and will use the correct approach to assert and handle the situation properly based on your requirements.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    original_dtype = ds['a'].values.dtype
    stacked_dtype = ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
    try:
        assert original_dtype == stacked_dtype, f"Dtype changed from {original_dtype} to {stacked_dtype} after stack operation"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Non-zero exit code to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script should behave as described:

- Execute and exit with code 0 (indicating the issue is fixed or not present) if the data types match.
- If the data types do not match (indicating the issue is present), it should raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

This approach ensures that the script's behavior accurately reflects the presence or absence of the issue described.
