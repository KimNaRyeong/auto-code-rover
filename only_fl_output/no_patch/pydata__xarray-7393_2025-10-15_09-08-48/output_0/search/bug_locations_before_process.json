This involves either avoiding unnecessary data type casting or explicitly restoring original data types after performing the stack operation if any interim steps inadvertently cast data types (e.g., from `'i4'` to `'i8'`). The code should either avoid the use of operations that automatically promote integer types or explicitly reassign the original data types to the involved coordinates after stacking using detailed dtype information captured before any operation."
