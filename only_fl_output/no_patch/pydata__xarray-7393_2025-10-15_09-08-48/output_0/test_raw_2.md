Based on your updated requirements, let's revise the script to ensure that it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, correctly reproducing the reported problem with clear stack trace output. This time, ensuring that the script checks the dtype equivalency accurately and exits with the expected condition.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    # Comparison of data types before and after stacking
    dtype_before = ds['a'].values.dtype
    dtype_after = ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
    try:
        # AssertionError is raised if data types do not match
        assert dtype_before == dtype_after, "Data type changed after stack operation."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Raises an AssertionError and exits with code 1 if the issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To clarify the expected behavior based on your requirements:
- The script will **raise an `AssertionError`** and print a detailed stack trace when the dtype changes post stack operation, indicating the presence of the issue.
- It will **exit with code 0** when the dtype remains unchanged, indicating the issue is fixed or not present.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is used to ensure that, if an assertion fails, you get a detailed understanding of where and why the failure occurred.
