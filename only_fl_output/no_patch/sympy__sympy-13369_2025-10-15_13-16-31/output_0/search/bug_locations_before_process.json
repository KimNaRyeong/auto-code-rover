It should ensure that symbolic parameters (like `x` in the issue) do not impede the root-finding process, possibly by leveraging more sophisticated symbolic analysis or algorithmic strategies that can deal with the exponential and other non-linear components seen in matrices like the one described."

        "intended_behavior": "Should reliably compute eigenvalues for all types of matrices, including those with symbolic expressions as entries. The method might need to incorporate fallback or alternative strategies for eigenvalue computation, similar in robustness to the `solve` method for cases where the direct computation through `roots` fails. This could involve automatically resorting to calculating eigenvalues through the solutions of the characteristic equation using `solve` when typical methods falter."
