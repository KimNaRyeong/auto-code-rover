        "intended_behavior": "The `get_group_by` method should handle `Random` expressions in a way that does not interfere with the intended aggregation of querysets. Specifically, when creating the `GROUP BY` clause, the method should filter out or ignore `Random` expressions so that they do not cause the unwanted breakdown of aggregated groups. The modification should preserve the method's existing functionality for all other cases, ensuring that it still constructs accurate `GROUP BY` clauses for a variety of query structures. This would involve adjusting the current logic that aggregates expressions for the `GROUP BY` clause, ensuring that instances of the `Random` function are not treated the same way as other expressions which are meant to contribute to the grouping criteria. A possible approach could be to refine the logic around lines 128-132, where expressions are extended based on `order_by` criteria, to exclude `Random` expressions from affecting group by logic directly."
