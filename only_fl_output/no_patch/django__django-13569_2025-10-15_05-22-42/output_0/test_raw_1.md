To address the issue properly and ensure that migrations are applied correctly to create the necessary tables, I will adjust the script. The key change involves specifying a unique label for the app (other than `'__main__'`, which can cause issues with Django's migration system) and ensuring that migrations are correctly handled. This revised approach circumvents the complexities that arose from the prior execution method.

```python
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Dummy app name for migrations to work correctly
APP_NAME = 'reproducer_app'

settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(APP_NAME,),
    ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,  # Required for `migrate` command
    SECRET_KEY='dummy-key',  # Required for some Django versions
)


# Models need to be defined after configuring settings but before calling migrate
class Thing(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = APP_NAME


class Related(models.Model):
    thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='related')

    class Meta:
        app_label = APP_NAME


def run_django_setup_and_migrations():
    from django.apps import apps
    from django.db import connections
    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor

    apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
    conn = connections['default']
    executor = MigrationExecutor(conn)
    executor.migrate(executor.loader.graph.leaf_nodes())

    apps.clear_cache()


def reproduce_issue():
    t = Thing.objects.create()
    [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]

    # This should produce a single row with 'rc' as 2.
    qs_standard = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')
    assert qs_standard[0]['rc'] == 2, "Standard aggregation is incorrect."

    # This results in breaking the aggregation, which is expected as ordering is on 'related'.
    qs_related = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')
    assert len(qs_related) == 2 and qs_related[0]['rc'] == 1, "Aggregation with order by 'related' is incorrect."

    # The issue is here: random order_by('?') should not break the aggregation.
    qs_random = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
    assert qs_random[0]['rc'] == 2, "Random order_by breaks aggregation incorrectly."


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_django_setup_and_migrations()

    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an error

    print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
    os._exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success
```

This script defines models after setting Djangoâ€™s configuration and executes Django's migration system programmatically, creating the required tables. It then reproduces the issue, asserts the unexpected behavior, and gracefully handles any assertion errors by printing a detailed stack trace. Finally, it exits with code 0 when the issue is reproduced successfully or exits with code 1 if an assertion fails, indicating the presence of the issue.
