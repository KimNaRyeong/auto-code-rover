Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the described issue. This script will setup a minimal Django project, run the necessary migrations, and test the behavior of Django's `order_by('?')` with aggregation. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'reproducer_app',
        ],
        TIME_ZONE='UTC',
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

    django.setup()

    class Thing(models.Model):
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'reproducer_app'
    
    class Related(models.Model):
        thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='related')
        
        class Meta:
            app_label = 'reproducer_app'

    from django.db import connections
    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor

    connection = connections['default']
    MigrationExecutor(connection).migrate()

    models.signals.post_migrate.send(sender=app, using=connection.alias)

    try:
        # Reproducing the issue
        t = Thing.objects.create()
        Related.objects.create(thing=t)
        Related.objects.create(thing=t)

        aggregated = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
        if aggregated[0]['rc'] != 2:
            raise AssertionError('Unexpected aggregation result with order_by("?"). Expected count of 2.')

        print("Aggregation worked as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    sys.exit(0)
```

Note: Before running this script, make sure you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`). This script assumes a fresh environment, where running it directly will attempt to reproduce the described behavior by dynamically setting up a Django environment, including models, and then running a specific query scenario that demonstrates the issue.

The script tries to aggregate `Thing` objects by counting the related `Related` objects and then applying a random `order_by('?')`. According to the described issue, the expected behavior is that the count should reflect the total number of related objects without being affected by the ordering. The script checks for this expectation and raises an `AssertionError` if the outcome is not as expected, printing out a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.
