Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.\nPull request is prepared \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15863\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, it is essential to gather more context about the bug related to the `floatformat` template filter in Django. To do so, here is a list of API calls that can help:\n\n1. Since the issue is with the `floatformat` filter, it's valuable to look into its implementation. Therefore, the first call should focus on finding the method definition:\n   - `search_method(\"floatformat\")`\n\n2. The issue mentions a problem with the conversion to Decimal within the `floatformat` implementation. To understand how Decimals are handled, it's important to look for code snippets where Decimal conversions happen within the context of `floatformat`. This could lead to finding the specific part of the code that needs modification:\n   - `search_code(\"Decimal(\")`\n\n3. The problem also seems to be connected with the interaction of the `floatformat` filter with Django's template system. Hence, identifying the class that processes template filters can provide broader context for how filters are invoked:\n   - `search_class(\"Template\")`\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these API calls should provide a solid foundation of code context for developing a fix."
