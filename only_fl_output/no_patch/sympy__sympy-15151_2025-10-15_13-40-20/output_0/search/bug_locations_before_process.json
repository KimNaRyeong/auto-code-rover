        "intended_behavior": "The `pretty` method needs to ensure that indexed expressions like `indexed(x1, i)` are rendered in a conventionally expected mathematical format, such as \"x_{1,i}\". This may involve adjusting the logic within `pretty` or bolstering the PrettyPrinter class to include special handling for `Indexed` objects to render them with subscripts appropriately. The implementation must detect `Indexed` instances and handle them in a way that outputs the correct formatting while maintaining the broad functionality for a diverse range of expressions."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `Indexed` class correctly represents mathematical objects with indices, it needs to ensure that its interaction with the pretty printing functionality explicitly supports rendering in the \"x_{1,i}\" format. This could involve providing a method or property that the pretty-printing functionality can use to ascertain the correct format for indexed expressions or ensuring that its representation is conducive to such formatting. Specifically, enhancements might be required around the `_sympystr` method or adjacent functionalities to explicitly format these expressions for pretty printing."
