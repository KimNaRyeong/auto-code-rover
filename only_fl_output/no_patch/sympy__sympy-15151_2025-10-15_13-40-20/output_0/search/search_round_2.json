It offers customization options such as line wrapping, number of columns, usage of Unicode characters, precision, ordering, and using a compact square root symbol.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug**: Given the issue mentions the expected behavior of getting \"x_{1,i}\" as a pretty-printed output but ends up with a different representation, it suggests that the issue may reside in how `pretty_print` (or a function it calls, like `pretty`) handles indexed expressions or expressions involving subscripts in general.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior should be that when `pretty_print` is called with an indexed expression, it should format it in a way that matches mathematical conventions closely, which in this context means transforming an expression like `indexed(x1, i)` into a visually appropriate format, likely using subscripts, \"x_{1,i}\".\n\nGiven the absence of findings for a `format_expression` method and the expected output \"x_{1,i}\", there are a couple of strategic API calls we could make next to drill down further:\n\n- Since the `pretty_print` method relies on `pretty` to do the actual formatting as suggested by the snippet, we should explore the `pretty` method itself. There may be specific handling for indexed types that can be adjusted or extended.\n- Given the significant role of the file `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` which likely deals with indexed objects (9 matches found), we should explore how these indexed expressions are formulated and if there's custom pretty-print handling within:\n\n1. **Explore `pretty` Method**: \n- `search_method_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")`: To see the implementation details of `pretty` which is directly called by `pretty_print`.\n\n2. **Investigate Handling of Indexed Expressions**:\n- Since `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` seems crucial for managing indexed expressions, determining how it integrates with the pretty-printing mechanism could be key.\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Indexed\", \"sympy/tensor/indexed.py\")`: To see if there's specific logic within the `Indexed` class that might affect how these objects are pretty-printed, possibly overriding default behavior or providing hooks for customization."

This might involve modifying how indexed objects are detected and rendered, possibly with special cases or enhancements for subscripts and supercripts handling within the pretty printing process.\n\n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`\n     - **Class**: `Indexed`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: If the `Indexed` class contains logic directly impacting how indexed expressions are represented when pretty-printed, it may need to be adjusted to ensure compatibility with the desired pretty-print format. This would involve ensuring that the class provides sufficient metadata or formatting hints to the pretty-printing process to correctly render \"x_{1,i}\" as expected. If `Indexed` class contributions to the pretty-print process are implicit or excessively generic, adding explicit handling or customization options for pretty printing might be necessary.\n\nBoth locations highlight the need for modifications to ensure the pretty printing process respects the formatting conventions for indexed expressions, preserving the overall functionality but enhancing it to address the use case outlined in the issue."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `pretty` Function in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `pretty` function serves the role of converting an expression into a prettified string format based on given settings. It creates a `PrettyPrinter` instance with the provided settings and uses it to transform the input expression into a human-readable string that can be displayed in a console or integrated into a GUI for better visualization of symbolic expressions.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `pretty` function is directly related to the issue since it's responsible for the output the user sees. The issue at hand\u2014an incorrect pretty-printed format for indexed expressions\u2014suggests that either the `pretty` function lacks the logic to correctly handle indexed expressions or the settings passed to it do not accommodate the customization needed for correct representation.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Intended Behavior: To address the issue, the `pretty` function (or a component it utilizes) should include explicit handling for \"indexed\" expressions, ensuring they are formatted according to conventional mathematical notation. For the specific case mentioned in the issue, this means recognizing objects of type `Indexed` and formatting them with subscripts in a manner consistent with the user's expectation (`x_{1,i}`). If necessary, additional settings or refinements in the `PrettyPrinter` class might be required to differentiate between different types of indexed expressions for accurate rendering.\n\n#### `Indexed` Class in `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Indexed` class represents mathematical objects that have indices, allowing for symbolic representation of elements within arrays, vectors, matrices, etc., with precise indexing. It supports the creation from a base (which could be a symbol or another indexed base) and indices.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the issue relates to indexed expressions ('indexed(x1, i)') being pretty-printed inaccurately, the `Indexed` class's structure and methods are central to understanding how these objects are translated into string representations for pretty printing. The bug could stem from how these objects are structured or how they interact with the pretty-printing mechanism.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Intended Behavior: For the `Indexed` class, an important behavior is ensuring that when instances of this class are passed to the pretty printer, they are correctly interpreted and rendered in the desired format. Adjustments might be required either in the `Indexed` class's method for rendering to string (e.g., overriding `__str__` or modifying `_sympystr`) or by ensuring that the `pretty` function has the necessary logic to handle `Indexed` instances correctly. Ideally, the class should provide a way to express indexed objects in the conventional subscript notation ('x_{1,i}') when pretty-printed.\n\nTogether, these findings point toward a necessity for closely integrated handling between the `pretty` function and the `Indexed` class definitions to resolve the formatting discrepancy. Adjustments could involve enhancing the pretty-printing settings or methods to handle indexed objects more gracefully and in a way that aligns with mathematical notation expectations.\n"

This may involve adjusting the logic within `pretty` or bolstering the PrettyPrinter class to include special handling for `Indexed` objects to render them with subscripts appropriately. The implementation must detect `Indexed` instances and handle them in a way that outputs the correct formatting while maintaining the broad functionality for a diverse range of expressions.\n\n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`\n     - **Class**: `Indexed`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: While the `Indexed` class correctly represents mathematical objects with indices, it needs to ensure that its interaction with the pretty printing functionality explicitly supports rendering in the \"x_{1,i}\" format. This could involve providing a method or property that the pretty-printing functionality can use to ascertain the correct format for indexed expressions or ensuring that its representation is conducive to such formatting. Specifically, enhancements might be required around the `_sympystr` method or adjacent functionalities to explicitly format these expressions for pretty printing."
