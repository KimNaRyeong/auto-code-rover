Given the context, it would be beneficial to search for methods or code related to pretty printing indexed variables, parsing, or rendering mathematical expressions. Here are the API calls we need:\n\n1. search_method(\"pretty_print\"): We're looking for a method that might be responsible for the pretty printing functionality.\n2. search_code(\"indexed\"): As the issue specifically mentions trouble with pretty printing \"indexed(x1, i)\", searching for instances where such indexed objects are handled could provide insights.\n3. search_method(\"format_expression\"): Assuming there might be a method specifically for formatting expressions into a specific syntax or style.\n4. search_code(\"x_{1,i}\"): Also searching for the expected output format might yield some examples of how the correct formatting should be achieved or if there's specialized handling in some parts of the codebase that's not being applied in this case."
