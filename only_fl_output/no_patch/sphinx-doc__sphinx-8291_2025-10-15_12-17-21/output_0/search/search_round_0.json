        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue reported, it's crucial to gather more context about how attributes and their type hints are handled in the classes mentioned. The issue points to the use of `attrs` and potentially `dataclasses` for declaring class attributes with type hints, and a problem occurs when generating documentation using Sphinx's `napoleon` extension. Attributes are not getting their types from annotations when using the google-style docstring format.\n\nWe will need to inspect the implementation of the classes mentioned in the issue, especially focusing on their attribute declarations and any related Sphinx directives or configuration utilized for documentation purposes. Since the issue specifically mentions issues with the documentation of class attributes when using type hints, and points out potential related issues in Sphinx's handling, it makes sense to explore the classes in the `pheres` project, particularly those involved with `attrs` or `dataclasses`.\n\nFrom the issue description, the `[code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)` provides a direct pointer to where we should look first.\n\nGiven this information, the initial set of API calls should focus on inspecting the relevant class definitions within the specified `exceptions.py` file. This would include fetching the context around class definitions and any peculiar or undocumented use of `attrs` or `dataclasses`. Since the issue description does not mention specific class names, we have to broadly search within the given file.\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"BaseException\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"attr.s(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n3. `search_code_in_file(\"dataclass(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find instances of class declarations using `attr.s` or `@dataclass`, and a look at `BaseException` as a generic attempt to find a potentially relevant class, assuming it might be inheriting or related to Python's built-in `BaseException` but could be customized within the `pheres` project.\n\nThis approach will provide a foundation upon which to build a deeper understanding of how the project defines and documents its attributes, which is essential for addressing the issue at hand."
