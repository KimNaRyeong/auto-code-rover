        "intended_behavior": "In the `execute` method, when instantiating the `CommandParser`, the constructor should be explicitly passed the `self.prog_name` as the `prog` argument. This will ensure that the parser reflects the correct program name for usage and help messages, especially in environments where `sys.argv[0]` might not be reliable or accurately reflects how the Django management command was invoked.\n\nThis change will make sure that:\n- The `prog` parameter of the `CommandParser` uses the program name as determined by the logic in `ManagementUtility.__init__` (e.g., either the base name of `argv[0]` or `'python -m django'` if `argv[0]` is `'__main__.py'`), thereby supporting variegated execution environments without needing to globally alter `sys.argv[0]`.\n- The existing functionality, where `CommandParser` parses command-line arguments to configure settings and Python paths before command execution, remains intact. The modification solely aligns the program name used in messages with the actual invocation context, improving clarity and accuracy in help and error messages."
