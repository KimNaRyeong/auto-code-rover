Search for the `ManagementUtility` class to understand its structure and see where `__init__` and potentially `execute_from_command_line` are defined, since the issue description mentions them specifically.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ManagementUtility\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `CommandParser` class to understand its constructor and how the `prog` argument is used. This is vital to ensure that passing `self.prog_name` as `prog` does not have unintended side effects elsewhere in its usage.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"CommandParser\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given the detail that the issue involves a method potentially named `execute_from_command_line` which uses `CommandParser` and possibly resides within `ManagementUtility`, we need to find this method to see how `CommandParser` is instantiated.\n\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"execute_from_command_line\", \"ManagementUtility\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, search for the specific instantiation code of `CommandParser` within `execute_from_command_line` method to confirm the current state and how `prog` is being used or not used.\n\n   ```\n   search_code('parser = CommandParser(usage=\\'%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]\\', add_help=False, allow_abbrev=False)')\n   ```"
