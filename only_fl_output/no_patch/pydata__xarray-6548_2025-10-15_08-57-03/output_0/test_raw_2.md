Certainly, let's create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue described. This script will specifically target the behavior where calling `xr.polyval` with a `coord` DataArray without a `name` attribute leads to a `KeyError`. The provided function to print the stack trace will be included to ensure clear output if the exception is encountered. 

Please note: This file needs to be run in an environment where the versions of the libraries potentially causing the issue (as described) are present. Adjustments might be necessary if future library updates address the reported problem.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    coeffs = xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims="degree")
    # Create a coord DataArray without a name attribute
    coord = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], dims="x")

    try:
        # This is the line we expect to fail if the issue is present
        xr.polyval(coord, coeffs)
    except KeyError as e:
        print("An error occurred as expected due to an unnamed coordinate DataArray:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the KeyError is raised as a result of the missing name attribute, assert success in reproducing the issue.
        assert str(e) == "None", "The exception message differs from expected. Issue might have changed."
    else:
        # If no error occurs, we assume the issue has been fixed.
        print("No error occurred. The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To execute this script, place it in the root directory of the project and run it using the command `python3 reproducer.py`. The script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the behavior under scrutiny is not correctly reproduced (i.e., if the KeyError does not occur as described or if the message within the KeyError does not match the expectation). Conversely, the script prints a message and attempts to exit with code `0` if it runs without encountering the specific error, suggesting the issue might have been resolved.
