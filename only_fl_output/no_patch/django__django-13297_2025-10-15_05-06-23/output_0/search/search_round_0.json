        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the handling of `SimpleLazyObject` in `get_context_data` causing a crash when filtering with Django 3.1, we need to inspect the classes, methods, and specific code snippets mentioned in the issue description. Here are the relevant API calls to make:\n\n1. Search the project for the `TemplateView` class to understand its implementation and any customizations made in this project.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"TemplateView\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific method `get_context_data`, let's look at its implementation in the `OfferView` class, which inherits from `TemplateView`.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"OfferView\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue description also mentions an error originating from `sqlite3/operations.py`. To understand the context of this error, let's locate the `_quote_params_for_last_executed_query` method, as it's directly related to the crash.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"_quote_params_for_last_executed_query\")\n   ```\n\n4. Given that `urls.py` is part of the setup, it may be beneficial to search for the specific URL pattern that maps to `OfferView` to confirm the correct use of `slug:offer_slug`.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"path('/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/', OfferView.as_view(), name='offer_view')\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches will provide comprehensive insights into how `OfferView` and its method `get_context_data` is designed to handle the slug parameter, the inheritance and usage of `TemplateView`, the interaction within the Django framework that leads to the error with SimpleLazyObjects, and how URLs are routed to views in this project context."
