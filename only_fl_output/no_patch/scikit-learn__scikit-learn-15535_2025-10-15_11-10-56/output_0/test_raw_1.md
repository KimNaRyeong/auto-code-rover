Based on your guidelines and considering the previous execution outcome which indicated an ImportError rather than the specific issue at hand, here's a revised approach to tackle the situation as described in your initial request. Note, this script explicitly aims to reproduce the scenario highlighting the regression in input validation of clustering metrics and manifests the assumptions that the sklearn and numpy libraries are correctly installed and operational within the environment it runs:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_mutual_info_score_behavior():
    from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue with `.astype(object)`
    try:
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
        mutual_info_score(x, x)
        # If no exception is raised, it means the issue might be fixed
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with string to float conversion is present.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.") from e

    # This block is added as per the initial instructions but is not expected
    # to exit with non-zero status if it only raises a warning.
    try:
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)
        mutual_info_score(x, x)
        print("The without `.astype(object)` part works as expected; however, it might show a deprecation warning.")
    except Warning as w:
        # Captures the warning without exiting
        print("Caught a warning: ", w)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred while testing without `.astype(object)`.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_mutual_info_score_behavior()
```

This standalone Python script, when placed in the root directory of the project and executed with Python 3, is designed to reproduce the specific issue related to the regression in input validation of clustering metrics that was introduced. The function `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` is used here according to your request, to ensure any exception raised is clearly reported with a detailed traceback to facilitate debugging. 

In the context of this script, it first tries to replicate the issue by using `np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)` as input to `sklearn.metrics.cluster.mutual_info_score`. If an error consistent with the described issue is encountered (specifically a `ValueError` related to string-to-float conversion), a detailed stack trace is printed, and an `AssertionError` is raised to indicate the issue persists.

Please ensure that the appropriate version of `scikit-learn` (as mentioned in your description of the issue) is installed within the environment this script is executed. Different `scikit-learn` versions may exhibit varying behaviors due to changes in implementation and dependency handling over time.
