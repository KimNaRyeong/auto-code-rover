The function `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` is used here according to your request, to ensure any exception raised is clearly reported with a detailed traceback to facilitate debugging. \n\nIn the context of this script, it first tries to replicate the issue by using `np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)` as input to `sklearn.metrics.cluster.mutual_info_score`. If an error consistent with the described issue is encountered (specifically a `ValueError` related to string-to-float conversion), a detailed stack trace is printed, and an `AssertionError` is raised to indicate the issue persists.\n\nPlease ensure that the appropriate version of `scikit-learn` (as mentioned in your description of the issue) is installed within the environment this script is executed. Different `scikit-learn` versions may exhibit varying behaviors due to changes in implementation and dependency handling over time."
