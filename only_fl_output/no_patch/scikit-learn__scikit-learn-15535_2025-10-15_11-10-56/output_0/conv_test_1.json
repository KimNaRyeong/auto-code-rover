In case of an error (specifically triggering from the issue present), it prints a comprehensive stack trace and raises an `AssertionError`.\n2. **Behavioral Note:** In the second block, it's highlighting the behavior change with a warning note. Although this part will not cause the script to exit with a failure (non-zero exit code) if a warning is simply raised, it provides a separate path to observe additional behavior (not directly contributing to the `AssertionError`).\n\nThis design aligns with the specified requirements: asserting the main issue's presence through an exception and detailing additional observed behavior whilst ensuring clear differentiation in handling both scenarios."
