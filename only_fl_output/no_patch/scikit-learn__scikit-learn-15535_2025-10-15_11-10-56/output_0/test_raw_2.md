Given your request to have a standalone Python file that aims to reproduce the issue and report it effectively, while handling any errors properly, below is the revised `reproducer.py` content placed within a code block. This script will check for the specific regression in input validation concerning clustering metrics, particularly the `mutual_info_score` function from `sklearn.metrics.cluster`. Additionally, it will use the recommended function to print the stack trace for clear visibility of errors.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_mutual_info_score_behavior():
    try:
        from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
        # Attempt to reproduce the issue with labels of type object 
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
        score = mutual_info_score(x, x)
        print("Mutual info score calculated successfully with a score of:", score)
        # Since the issue is primarily about a regression error, reaching here implies it's fixed.
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        if "could not convert string to float" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue where input as object causes 'could not convert string to float' is present.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_mutual_info_score_behavior()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # If AssertionError, it implies the issue was reproduced successfully.
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script tests the core issue by attempting to calculate the mutual information score using an input array of type object, which in earlier versions of `scikit-learn` would have worked without any warning or error. According to your specifications, if the code throws a `ValueError` indicating it cannot convert string to float, it captures this as evidence the issue remains, provides a detailed traceback for diagnosis, and exits with code 1 to indicate failure due to the issue being present.

Ensure you execute this script with a Python 3 environment where the specified version of `scikit-learn` and `numpy` are installed. Adjustments or installations of specific library versions may be necessary to suit the exact conditions under which the issue reproduces.
