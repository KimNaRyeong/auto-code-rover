        "intended_behavior": "This function should gracefully handle input arrays of object types, such as strings, enabling it to calculate the Mutual Information score without throwing type errors or requiring input arrays to be of a specific numerical type. The method relies on preprocessing steps and validations (such as check_clusterings and the calculation of contingency_matrix) that may need adjustments to ensure compatibility with non-numeric data types, mimicking the functionality available in version 0.21.1.\n\nThe resolution might entail ensuring that the check_array (used within contingency_matrix or any similar validation step) and related functions are capable of accepting or converting inputs in a way that they are processed correctly for the MI calculation, potentially by reintroducing or adapting type handling that was present in the older version. The goal is to maintain the method's capability to evaluate mutual information for clusterings with label inputs including strings, without regression from previous versions' abilities."
