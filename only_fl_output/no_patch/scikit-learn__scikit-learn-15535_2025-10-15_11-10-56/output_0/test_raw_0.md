This script is structured to capture two behavioral facets of the issue:
1. **Assertion Error:** When executing the first block, the script expects it to run without any exceptions (asserting the issue is fixed if no exception is raised). In case of an error (specifically triggering from the issue present), it prints a comprehensive stack trace and raises an `AssertionError`.
2. **Behavioral Note:** In the second block, it's highlighting the behavior change with a warning note. Although this part will not cause the script to exit with a failure (non-zero exit code) if a warning is simply raised, it provides a separate path to observe additional behavior (not directly contributing to the `AssertionError`).

This design aligns with the specified requirements: asserting the main issue's presence through an exception and detailing additional observed behavior whilst ensuring clear differentiation in handling both scenarios.
