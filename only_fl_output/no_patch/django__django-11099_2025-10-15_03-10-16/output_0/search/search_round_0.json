However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

Search for the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class to understand its current implementation and where the regex is applied.\n2. Search for the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class for the same reasons as above.\n3. Search for the code snippets using the regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to find all occurrences that need to be changed to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ASCIIUsernameValidator\")\nsearch_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")\nsearch_code(\"r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\")\n```"
