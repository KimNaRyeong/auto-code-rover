However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

Let's analyze the context and understand the implications based on the issue at hand:\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` Classes\nBoth classes are located in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` and inherit from `validators.RegexValidator`. These validators are designed to enforce username patterns for ASCII and Unicode characters, respectively. They share the same regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to validate usernames, allowing alphanumeric characters along with `., @, +, -, and _`. \n\n### Relationship with the Bug\nThe issue described points out a critical oversight in the used regex patterns: `$` can match a position before a newline at the end of the string. This behavior allows usernames that erroneously end with a newline character to pass validation, contradicting the intended validation logic that should only accept the characters explicitly defined in the regex pattern.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior is to validate usernames strictly against the pattern, excluding any trailing newline characters. The modification suggested in the issue description, changing the regex pattern to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`, addresses this by using `\\A` and `\\Z` to respectively match the start and end of the string, strictly not allowing newline characters at the end.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, it's clear that both classes need a modification in their `regex` attribute to prevent the acceptance of trailing newline characters in usernames. The original issue post was accurate in its solution to replace the current regex pattern with one that enforces the intended end-of-string behavior.\n\nTo proceed, updating the regex pattern in both validator classes in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` would resolve the issue:\n- For `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, change `regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`.\n- For `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, apply the same change.\n\nThis action will directly address the relationship between the validators and the bug, ensuring that usernames ending with a newline character are rejected, thus aligning the validators' functionality with the intended behaviour. The next concrete action would involve implementing these changes in the codebase. Since the exact lines for these definitions have been located, the task is straightforward and involves editing the regex assignment lines in both validator class definitions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - File: `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n  - Class: `ASCIIUsernameValidator`\n  - Intended Behavior: The `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class is intended to validate usernames containing only English letters, numbers, and specific symbols (`@`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `_`) without allowing trailing newline characters. To resolve the issue, the regex pattern in the `regex` attribute must be changed from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change ensures that the end of the string is explicitly defined to not include newline characters, preserving the existing functionality while preventing the acceptance of usernames ending with a newline.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n  - Class: `UnicodeUsernameValidator`\n  - Intended Behavior: Similar to `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class should enforce that usernames consist solely of letters (Unicode supported), numbers, and the symbols `@`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `_` without allowing trailing newline characters. The regex pattern shall be updated from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'` to properly prevent usernames from ending with a newline character. This action fixes the issue while maintaining the validator\u2019s purpose to include a wider range of character encodings in usernames.\n\nThese modifications directly address the reported issue by ensuring that username validations strictly adhere to the specified character requirements without allowing newline characters at the end of usernames."
