Search for the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class to understand its current implementation and where the regex is applied.\n2. Search for the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class for the same reasons as above.\n3. Search for the code snippets using the regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to find all occurrences that need to be changed to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ASCIIUsernameValidator\")\nsearch_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")\nsearch_code(\"r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\")\n```"
