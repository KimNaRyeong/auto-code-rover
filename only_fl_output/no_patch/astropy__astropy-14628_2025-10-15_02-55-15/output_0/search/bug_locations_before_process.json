        "intended_behavior": "Modify the get_itrs method to accept an additional, optional argument named location, which also should be of type EarthLocation or possibly None by default. When location is not None, calculate the vector difference between the current EarthLocation instance and the provided location argument to produce a topocentric position instead of the current geocentric position. The calculation for topocentric position should accurately transform the position of the EarthLocation instance relative to the location argument into an ITRS frame, taking into account the obstime if provided. This feature should extend the existing functionality in a backward-compatible manner, preserving the current behavior when the location argument is not supplied (i.e., default None), thus maintaining the method's ability to return a geocentric ITRS frame. Additional effort must be allocated to ensuring that the implementation does not introduce circular import issues or dependencies that could affect the performance or functionality of the EarthLocation or ITRS classes."
