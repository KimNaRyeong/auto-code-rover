        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code and context in relation to the feature request, we can outline the functions and relationships between these code segments and the requested feature enhancement.\n\n### Analysis of `EarthLocation` Class\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `EarthLocation` class represents a specific location on Earth and provides methods to transform this location into various coordinate frames. It includes methods to create `EarthLocation` instances from geocentric (x, y, z coordinates) or geodetic (longitude, latitude, and height) coordinates. It also provides properties to access geographic coordinates, height, and transformation methods such as `get_itrs()`, which returns an ITRS (International Terrestrial Reference System) frame for the location.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The `get_itrs` method within `EarthLocation` is directly related to the enhancement request. Right now, this method generates an ITRS object based on the EarthLocation's own position for the specified `obstime` (observation time). The issue suggests extending this method's functionality to allow generating an ITRS location that is topocentric\u2014relative to another given location.\n\n### Analysis of `get_itrs` Method\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `get_itrs` method generates an `ITRS` object corresponding to the EarthLocation instance for a specific observation time. It directly converts the geocentric coordinates (x, y, z) of the `EarthLocation` instance to an `ITRS` frame.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- This method is the target for enhancement to accept an additional argument (`location`), making it possible to calculate a topocentric ITRS frame rather than strictly a geocentric one.\n\n**Intended behavior of this code given the issue description?**\n\n- The intended enhancement would involve modifying `get_itrs` to optionally accept a second `EarthLocation` instance as an argument (representing the 'location' relative to which the topocentric position is to be calculated). If provided, the method would calculate the difference between the object's position and the `location` argument's position, instead of returning the geocentric position.\n\n### Analysis of `ITRS` Class\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- Represents the ITRS coordinate frame, including attributes such as `obstime` (observation time) and `location`. It uses Cartesian representation by default for its coordinates.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The `ITRS` class is the output format for the `get_itrs` method. Understanding its structure and attributes is necessary for implementing the feature, particularly how it might represent or adjust for a topocentric vs. geocentric position, and how the proposed `location` parameter might interact with or alter the `location` attribute already present in `ITRS`.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- Within the context of the new feature, the `ITRS` class might need adjustments or considerations on how it represents a topocentric position, especially if it involves a different interpretation of the `location` attribute or additional calculations upon setting this attribute based on the new functionality in `get_itrs`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo fulfill the issue requirements, the next step would involve drafting the changes to `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` to:\n1. Accept a new `location` argument, defaulting to `None`.\n2. Perform the necessary calculations when a `location` is provided to return a topocentric ITRS frame.\n3. Consider how these changes affect the interaction with the `ITRS` class and adjust accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, considering how to test these modifications and document the new functionality would be critical for ensuring its correctness and usability."

The solution must seamlessly integrate with the existing coordinate transformation framework within Astropy to ensure accuracy and maintain the library's overall integrity."
