        "content": "To resolve the issue of models history not using verbose names in Django's admin, we need to understand how the history logging mechanism works and where the verbose names should be used. To gather the needed context, let's invoke a few API calls to look into the admin and model sections of the project.\n\n1. Let's start by finding out where the model's history changes are being logged. This could be in a method related to saving or updating the model's history in the Django admin. We can look for methods named similarly to \"log_change\", \"save_history\", or \"log_history\" that may handle these operations.\n\n2. Since the issue describes a scenario where a field's verbose name is not being used, we also need the context around how field names are retrieved and used when creating history messages. This could involve methods or functions that serialize model fields for logging purposes. Necessary methods could be named like \"get_field_names\", \"get_verbose_name\", or similar.\n\n3. Lastly, it's worth checking if there's a specific utility or handler in the Django admin responsible for formatting history messages. This could involve searching for helper functions or methods that format these logs.\n\nI will make the following API calls based on the steps outlined above:\n\n- search_method(\"log_change\")\n- search_method(\"save_history\")\n- search_method(\"log_history\")\n- search_code(\"get_verbose_name\")\n- search_code(\"Changed pub_date\")"

What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `log_change` method logs any changes made to an object by an admin user. Specifically, it records the action in the Django admin's `LogEntry` objects with an action flag indicating it was a change action. The method receives the `request`, the `object` that was changed, and a `message` detailing what was changed.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThis method is directly related to the bug as it is responsible for creating the log entry that appears in the model's history. The `message` parameter, which details what was changed, seems to be where the issue lies \u2014 the bug describes these messages not utilizing verbose names for fields, which suggests that wherever this `message` is being generated or formatted, it is not correctly using the verbose names defined in the model fields.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be for the `message` parameter to include human-readable (verbose) field names rather than their code equivalents. Instead of showing a change message like \"Changed pub_date,\" it should display \"Changed date published,\" assuming `pub_date` is defined with the verbose name \"date published\" in a model. This suggests that a patch may need to involve modifying how the `message` is generated to ensure it properly retrieves and uses verbose names.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems the next steps should focus on how the `message` parameter is generated and fed into `log_change`. We need to locate the code that constructs these change messages. Since direct searches for code related to `get_verbose_name` and the exact string \"Changed pub_date\" came up empty, we should consider broader searches that could lead us to related functionalities. One approach could be to look into:\n\n- How `LogEntry` objects are formatted, as they might rely on a separate mechanism or representation of changes that include field names.\n- The serialization and/or logging of model changes within the Django admin or Django models that precede the call to `log_change`, possibly focusing on admin actions or signals that trigger logging.\n\nGiven this, I'll attempt the following API call to investigate further into how change messages are built and how they could relate to the `log_change` function or `LogEntry` model utilization:\n\n- search_class(\"LogEntry\")\n- search_code(\"log_action\")"

While the method is correctly logging changes, it relies on an external `message` being passed. The fix should ensure that wherever the `message` is generated, it uses the model's verbose field names. This might not require a direct modification within the `log_change` method itself but rather the mechanism that constructs the `message` passed to it.\n   \n   To resolve the issue, an enhancement in the process that generates the `change_message` before it's passed to `log_change` is necessary. This could be implementing a new method or modifying an existing process that interprets the model's fields and their changes, translating field names to their verbose names for the log entry. Optionally, a function could be introduced to dynamically map field names to verbose names within the admin site's context when constructing the `change_message`. \n\n   There isn't a specific file or method that has been identified as the source of the 'message' generation from the current context provided. However, the resolution involves ensuring that the logging mechanism (potentially within `ModelAdmin` or related admin functionality) refers to field verbose names over their code identifiers when composing messages about model changes. This might entail creating a utility function within `options.py` or a related admin module that fetches verbose names and applies them to the change messages."
