        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `open_dataset` method to check if the `engine` parameter is a function or class object. If so, the method should bypass the usual engine string validation and directly use the provided object as the backend engine. This allows direct invocation of custom backend functionalities when opening a dataset, thereby addressing the feature request for easier addition of custom backends. This modification must ensure that it does not impact the current functionality for users who specify backends via string identifiers, preserving backwards compatibility and the overall behavior of the method for existing use cases."
