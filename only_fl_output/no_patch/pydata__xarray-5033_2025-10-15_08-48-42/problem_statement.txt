Simplify adding custom backends

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Why can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:
```python
from custom_backend import engine

ds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)
```
This seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.
