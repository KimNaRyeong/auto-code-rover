            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about several key components mentioned in the issue description. These components include `GenericForeignKey`, `EmptyFieldListFilter`, and how they are implemented or used within models and admin configurations. Here's a plan for using the API calls:\n\n1. **GenericForeignKey**: Since the bug relates to `GenericForeignKey`, understanding its implementation and usage will be crucial. We should look into its class definition and any custom methods it may have that are relevant to this issue.\n\n2. **EmptyFieldListFilter**: As the issue arises when trying to use `EmptyFieldListFilter` with `GenericForeignKey`, we need information on `EmptyFieldListFilter`. Specifically, how it is designed to work with model fields and what attributes it expects from those fields.\n\n3. **Admin Configuration for Model**: The issue also involves how the `GenericForeignKey` is used within an admin class. It would be helpful to see examples or definitions of admin classes that use `GenericForeignKey` to understand how they should be properly configured.\n\nBased on these points, I'll issue several API calls for detailed context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"GenericForeignKey\")`: This will help us understand the implementation of `GenericForeignKey`.\n\n2. `search_class(\"EmptyFieldListFilter\")`: This call aims to gather details on `EmptyFieldListFilter` and its requirements or expectations from the fields it works with.\n\n3. `search_code(\"GenericForeignKey\")`: Since `GenericForeignKey` is a key focus of the issue, searching for code snippets where it's used might reveal insights into common patterns or related challenges.\n\n4. `search_code(\"list_filter = (('resource_contract', admin.EmptyFieldListFilter)\")`: Obtaining code snippets that specifically show how `EmptyFieldListFilter` is intended to be used in admin configurations with fields like `GenericForeignKey`.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of how `GenericForeignKey` and `EmptyFieldListFilter` are implemented and interact, which is essential for resolving the reported issue."
