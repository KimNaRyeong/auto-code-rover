Given that the issue specifically involves the handling of class attributes with annotations and the use of the `autoclass` directive in `index.rst`, I will perform the following API calls to explore relevant parts of the project:\n\n1. **Searching for the superclass (`Foo`) definition:** To understand how annotations are declared and possibly mishandled.\n   - `search_class(\"Foo\")`\n\n2. **Searching for the subclass (`Bar`) definition:** Given that the subclass inherits from `Foo` and the issue is with how inherited annotated members are treated as undocumented, we'll need the subclass definition for complete context.\n   - `search_class(\"Bar\")`\n\n3. **Searching for where `autoclass` is handled:** Since the issue arises when using the `autoclass` directive from Sphinx's `autodoc` extension and involves how it processes inherited members, investigating the code that handles these directives would provide insight into where the behavior diverges from expectations.\n   - `search_code(\".. autoclass::\")`"
