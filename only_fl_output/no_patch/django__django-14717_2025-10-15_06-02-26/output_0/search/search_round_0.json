Here is one of them: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/fe074c96a343530beea50fbdd0803d3e7b739e8e/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L1156-L1167\nFor example, in each of them, timezone.now() is called even when the return value isn't needed / won't be used.\n</issue>"

Here are the appropriate API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Get context around the specific method mentioned in the issue link:**\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", 1156, 10)`. This call will help us understand the structure and comments around the method in question.\n\n2. **Search for all occurrences of `_check_fix_default_value` methods within `__init__.py` file to compare their implementations:**\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_check_fix_default_value\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")`. This should return other locations of `_check_fix_default_value` methods to analyze their need for optimization or bug fixes.\n\n3. **Look up the usage of `timezone.now()` within the context of these methods to pinpoint unnecessary calls:**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"timezone.now()\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")`. This will help in identifying all instances where `timezone.now()` is being called, so we can verify if these instances are indeed needed or if they contribute to the described issue.\n\nThese API calls will provide us with a detailed overview of the methods in question and their implementation details."
