The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we'll need to look into several areas of the Django codebase, particularly around exception handling in the autoreloader and AppConfig classes. Here's the plan for our API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the AppConfig class**: Since the issue mentions inheriting from `AppConfig` and overriding the `ready` method, it's essential to understand the context of how `AppConfig` is designed and its relationship with Django startup processes.\n\n2. **Search for the autoreload.raise_last_exception method**: The core of the issue stems from changes to how exceptions are re-raised in the autoreloader, particularly in `django.utils.autoreload.raise_last_exception`. We need to view the current implementation of this method to understand the problem and think about potential fixes.\n\n3. **Search for any mention of the `MyException` class in the codebase**: While `MyException` might be user-defined and specific to the issue description, it\u2019s useful to see if there are unique handling or references to custom exceptions in the Django code related to the AppConfig ready method or in the autoreload mechanism.\n\n4. **Look into the commit mentioned in the issue description**: Although direct access to the repository's commit history might not be available through these APIs, understanding that changes were made in a specific commit (`c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca`) could inform us of the context and reasoning behind those changes. This step is more about recognizing the importance of this commit in our analysis even if we can't directly inspect the commit via API calls.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AppConfig\")`\n2. `search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")`\n3. `search_code(\"MyException\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of how exceptions are handled within the AppConfig loading process and the autoreloader."
