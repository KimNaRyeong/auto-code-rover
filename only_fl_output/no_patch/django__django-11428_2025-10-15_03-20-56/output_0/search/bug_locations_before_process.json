        "intended_behavior": "The `raise_last_exception` method should be adjusted to preserve the existing functionality of accurately re-raising exceptions caught by the autoreloader, but it must be enhanced to handle exceptions with custom signatures properly. Instead of attempting to reconstruct the exception with assumed parameters, the method should directly re-raise the captured exception if it\u2019s of a custom type or has a constructor that does not match the standard exception signature. This could involve checking if the exception's constructor expects arguments other than the default and, if so, opting to re-raise it without attempting reconstruction. An alternative approach could also be implementing a mechanism to capture and re-raise the original exception object as is, thus avoiding the need to reconstruct it and potentially mishandling exceptions with custom signatures."
