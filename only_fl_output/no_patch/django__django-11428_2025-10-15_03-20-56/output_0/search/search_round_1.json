The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

Here's the plan for our API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the AppConfig class**: Since the issue mentions inheriting from `AppConfig` and overriding the `ready` method, it's essential to understand the context of how `AppConfig` is designed and its relationship with Django startup processes.\n\n2. **Search for the autoreload.raise_last_exception method**: The core of the issue stems from changes to how exceptions are re-raised in the autoreloader, particularly in `django.utils.autoreload.raise_last_exception`. We need to view the current implementation of this method to understand the problem and think about potential fixes.\n\n3. **Search for any mention of the `MyException` class in the codebase**: While `MyException` might be user-defined and specific to the issue description, it\u2019s useful to see if there are unique handling or references to custom exceptions in the Django code related to the AppConfig ready method or in the autoreload mechanism.\n\n4. **Look into the commit mentioned in the issue description**: Although direct access to the repository's commit history might not be available through these APIs, understanding that changes were made in a specific commit (`c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca`) could inform us of the context and reasoning behind those changes. This step is more about recognizing the importance of this commit in our analysis even if we can't directly inspect the commit via API calls.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AppConfig\")`\n2. `search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")`\n3. `search_code(\"MyException\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of how exceptions are handled within the AppConfig loading process and the autoreloader."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's explore the findings:\n\n### 1. Result from `search_class(\"AppConfig\")`:\nThe `AppConfig` class in `django/apps/config.py` serves as a configuration class for Django applications. Each Django app can have an `AppConfig` subclass, typically defined in an `apps.py` file, where developers can override methods like `ready` to execute initialization code upon application startup.\n\n**Relation to the bug**: The issue describes overriding the `ready` method to raise a custom exception, `MyException`, which then leads to problems with the autoreloader. The autoreloader's handling of this exception seems to be the core of the problem.\n\n**Intended behavior**: The intended behavior would be for the autoreloader to correctly re-raise exceptions without losing context or causing type errors, even when exceptions have custom signatures.\n\n### 2. Result from `search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")`:\nThe method `raise_last_exception` in `django/utils/autoreload.py` is designed to re-raise the last exception caught by Django's autoreloading mechanism. It constructs a new exception with the same type and arguments as the original one.\n\n**Relation to the bug**: This method directly relates to the bug, as it attempts to reconstruct the exception rather than simply re-raising it, which leads to a `TypeError` when dealing with exceptions that have custom initializers expecting more than the default one argument.\n\n**Intended behavior**: Ideally, `raise_last_exception` should re-raise exceptions in such a way that preserves the original exception's type and state without assuming the presence of a specific signature. This would involve either adapting the method to handle custom exceptions more gracefully or reverting to a simpler re-raise mechanism that does not attempt reconstruction.\n\n### 3. Result from `search_code(\"MyException\")`:\nThere were no results for `MyException` in the codebase, which is expected since this seems to be a user-defined exception for demonstration purposes. The absence highlights that the issue is not with `MyException` per se but with how Django's autoreloader handles custom exception types.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the issue and the context we've gathered, it seems the fix should involve modifying the `raise_last_exception` method to safely and accurately re-raise exceptions of any type, including those with custom initializers. A potential solution could be modifying this method to check if the original exception can be re-raised directly, thus preserving its complete state, or finding a more flexible way to reconstruct exceptions without assuming a single-argument initializer.\n\nTo fully understand the potential impact of such changes and explore possible solutions, we may need to review how exceptions are captured and stored by the autoreloader (`_exception` global variable) and investigate any existing tests covering exception handling within the autoreloading process. However, with the current API capabilities and information, focusing on adjusting `raise_last_exception` seems like the most direct approach to address the reported issue."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Instead of attempting to reconstruct the exception with assumed parameters, the method should directly re-raise the captured exception if it\u2019s of a custom type or has a constructor that does not match the standard exception signature. This could involve checking if the exception's constructor expects arguments other than the default and, if so, opting to re-raise it without attempting reconstruction. An alternative approach could also be implementing a mechanism to capture and re-raise the original exception object as is, thus avoiding the need to reconstruct it and potentially mishandling exceptions with custom signatures."
