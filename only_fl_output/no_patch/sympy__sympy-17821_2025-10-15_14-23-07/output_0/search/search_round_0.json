In many cases we could generate those equations ourselves instead of typing them manually (I found errors while doing #11014 for example).\nThis PR should demonstrate the idea.  @asmeurer what do you think?  Will this work?  Its certainly nice for maintainance, although it is probably slightly less readable...\n(If we want to do this widely, the latex printer could probably be optimized for things like `^{2}` and when it uses `\\left(` instead of `(`.)\n#### Release notes\n* core\n* Catalan can be rewritten as a sum\n</issue>"

The issue mentions the need to implement `S.Catalan.rewrite(Sum)` and discusses improving the documentation by auto-generating LaTeX equations, hinting at some concerns with readability and maintainability.\n\nLet's break down the search queries to target the relevant parts of the project:\n\n1. **Search for the `Catalan` class or constant** in the codebase to understand its current implementation and where the `rewrite` method might be added or modified.\n\n2. **Search for any existing `rewrite` methods** to understand how they are implemented elsewhere in the project, as this could be useful for implementing `S.Catalan.rewrite(Sum)`.\n\n3. **Search for the usage of LaTeX in documentation** to get an idea of how and where equations are currently included manually, potentially via a snippet of code that is likely to be used for embedding LaTeX, such as docstrings or comments indicating LaTeX.\n\nConsidering these points, we can structure our search API calls as:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` - This call will help us find where the Catalan class or constant is defined.\n\n2. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` - This call will give us examples of rewrite methods across the project to understand their implementation pattern.\n\n3. `search_code(\"LaTeX\")` - A search for \"LaTeX\" in the codebase should help identify how LaTeX is currently being embedded into documentation, which could inform how we might automate this process.\n\nThese calls are intended to give us a comprehensive understanding of the areas impacted by the issue and help us gather sufficient context to approach both the implementation of the rewrite function and the potential automation of LaTeX equation generation in the documentation."
