        "intended_behavior": "The `bound_data` method needs to be modified to handle the case where `data` is `None`. Given that `JSONField` might be optional and may not always receive data, especially in cases where the form is rendered with initial values being `None`, the method should not attempt to parse `None` as JSON. Instead, it should return `None` or a default value that signifies no data was provided.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality:\n- Before attempting to load the data using `json.loads`, the method should check if `data` is `None`.\n- If `data` is indeed `None`, return `None` directly, bypassing the `json.loads` call. This prevents the `TypeError` while ensuring that optional `JSONField` usage does not break form rendering.\n- This change allows `JSONField` to still accept and properly handle actual JSON data, including empty JSON objects or arrays, while correctly interpreting a lack of data (`None`) as a valid state, thus not raising an exception."
