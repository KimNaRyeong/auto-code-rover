Searching for the `JSONField` class implementation to understand its structure and relevant methods.\n2. Looking for the `bound_data` method or any method that deals with processing or preparing data within `JSONField`.\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions that rendering a form with a `JSONField` with no value crashes, finding code snippets that handle rendering or initializing `JSONField` with data might also be useful.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find where the `JSONField` class is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")`: Since the issue mentions `JSONField.bound_data`, this will help us locate how `bound_data` is implemented within `JSONField` if `bound_data` is indeed a method specific to `JSONField`.\n- `search_code(\"form = JSONForm({})\")`: To get context on how forms with `JSONField` might be initialized without data, as mentioned in the issue, to see if there's a pattern or common practice within the codebase that needs adjustment."
