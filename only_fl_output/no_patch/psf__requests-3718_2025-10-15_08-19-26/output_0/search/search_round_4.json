Another possibility is that the code resides in a different repository or a location that the search API does not directly index.\n\nTo navigate around these limitations, we can adjust our strategy by:\n\n1. Expanding the search to methods and code snippets that are mentioned in the stack trace and are likely to exist in the codebase. Specifically, we can look into how the `requests` library is utilized since it's a common library and the error seems related to its usage.\n2. Given the error occurs in `requests.models.py` during a call to `.content`, which in turn tries to read from `self.raw.read`, it would be insightful to know how the `requests` session is initialized and used in the context that leads to this call. This includes examining the customization and handling of responses, especially focusing on streaming or chunked responses, as these features directly interact with `self.raw.read`.\n3. Since `requests_mock` is mentioned, understanding its setup and usage in the tests could provide insights into why `self.raw` could be `None`.\n\nLet's make the following API calls to further our investigation based on the stack trace information and the components involved in the bug:\n\n- `search_code(\"requests.head\")`: Since the `head` method from requests is explicitly mentioned, examining how it's used across the codebase might reveal customizations or usage patterns that lead to `self.raw` being `None`.\n- `search_code(\"requests_mock\")`: This will help us understand how `requests_mock` is configured and used, highlighting potential issues with mock setups that could lead to the observed issue.\n- `search_code(\"self.raw.read\")`: Although it's less likely to find direct references to this internal `requests` operation, there could be relevant handling or checks around `self.raw` that are custom to the coala project, especially in the context of error handling or response processing.\n\nThese adjusted calls aim to uncover how `requests` and `requests_mock` are integrated and used within the project, providing clues on the interaction that leads to `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'`."

Without direct access to the specific source code and based on the given stack trace and error description, we can infer the following potential bug location and propose an intended behavior to resolve the issue:\n\n### Bug Location:\n- **File**: `bears/general/InvalidLinkBear.py`\n- **Class**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests the issue is within the implementation related to handling HTTP requests, possibly in a method that deals with fetching HTTP headers or content. The direct method implicated is `get_status_code`.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\nThe issue arises from a `NoneType` object, which suggests that `self.raw` is `None` at the time `.read` is called. The intended behavior is to ensure `self.raw` is not `None` before attempting to read from it. This can be a part of error-handling logic around network requests where the response object is thoroughly checked before accessing its contents. Specifically:\n- Implement or enhance checks around the response object to ensure `self.raw` is available and not `None` before proceeding with any operation that assumes its presence.\n- In the case where `self.raw` could be `None` (e.g., mocked responses, errors in fetching, or unexpected response types), the code should gracefully handle these scenarios, possibly by logging an error or returning a default error code indicating the failure to obtain a valid HTTP response.\n- Additionally, review the usage of `requests_mock` or any other mocking/stubbing mechanism to ensure it's correctly simulating network responses, including setting the `raw` attribute when needed.\n\nAnother aspect to consider could be the upgrade of the `requests` library and its compatibility with `requests_mock` or how the project uses the library's interfaces, which might have changed between versions. The intended behavior here would include ensuring compatibility with newer versions of `requests` or adjusting usage patterns to match the expected behavior of the updated library.\n\nDue to the limitations in directly pinpointing the method within `InvalidLinkBear.py` without precise search results, the described intended behavior provides a generic strategy to address the identified issue based on the nature of the error and the surrounding context of its occurrence."

Focus should be on changes related to how responses and their raw streams are handled.\n\n2. **Ensure `requests_mock` Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of `requests_mock` used is compatible with `requests` 2.12.1. Incompatibility between these libraries could lead to unexpected behaviors such as `self.raw` being `None`.\n\n3. **Robust Error Handling**: Improve error handling around network request operations. This includes checking response objects for validity before accessing their properties or methods. Specifically, before accessing `self.raw.read`, the code should verify that `self.raw` is not `None`.\n\n4. **Debugging and Logging**: Increase logging around the area where the error occurs to capture more context about the state of objects when the error happens. This could provide insights into why `self.raw` is `None`.\n\n5. **Consultation and Documentation**: Consult the documentation for both `requests` and `requests_mock` for any updated practices on mocking responses, particularly focusing on how to properly simulate raw response objects.\n\n6. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Enhance unit and integration tests around the functionality that involves `requests` and `requests_mock` to ensure that any changes in libraries or code logic do not introduce regressions or unhandled scenarios.\n\nSince more precise action cannot be taken without concrete code locations or access, these general strategies are advised to systematically approach, diagnose, and resolve the issue given the stack trace and the nature of the error provided.

        "content": "Based on the single successful search result obtained, let's analyze the context and its relevance to the issue:\n\n### Search Result Analysis\n\nThe code snippet is from `requests/models.py` within the `Response` class, specifically in the `iter_content` function. This section of the code is responsible for handling streamed content from an HTTP response. When called, `iter_content` yields chunks of the response's content, allowing the content to be processed in pieces rather than loading it entirely into memory. This is particularly useful for large downloads or when the content size is unknown.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThis part reads chunks of data from the response's raw stream (`self.raw.read(chunk_size)`) in a loop and yields each chunk until no more data is available. It's designed for efficient data handling, especially when working with potentially large responses.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'` occurs precisely at the line `chunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)`, indicating that `self.raw` is `None` at the moment this line tries to execute. This is conflicting because `self.raw` is expected to be a file-like object from which the content can be read, typically set by the underlying adapter when the response is received.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior in this part of the code would be to safely access `self.raw.read` only when `self.raw` is not `None`, implying that there should be a check to ensure `self.raw` is a valid file-like object before attempting to read from it. Alternatively, if `self.raw` being `None` is a valid state in certain conditions (like when a request is mocked for tests or in specific scenarios where no content is expected), then there should be handling to skip or manage the operation differently in such cases.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nTo resolve the issue, two potential approaches can be taken:\n\n1. **Verify and Ensure `self.raw` Initialization**: Ensure that `self.raw` is correctly initialized as a file-like object before reaching this part of the code. This might involve tracing back to where the `Response` object is created or populated, particularly focusing on the interactions with the `requests` library and its adapters that handle HTTP response content.\n\n2. **Defensive Programming**: Add a conditional check before `self.raw.read(chunk_size)` to ensure `self.raw` is not `None`. If `self.raw` is `None`, the method should handle this gracefully\u2014either by breaking out of the loop, logging a warning, or handling it according to the application's error-handling strategy.\n\nGiven the specifics of `requests`' internal workings and the widespread use of the library, any modification should be carefully considered to avoid unintended side effects. For projects depending on `requests`, ensuring proper usage and integration, especially when upgrading library versions, is crucial. If the issue arises from changes in the `requests` library, consulting the library's changelog and documentation for proper migration paths or known issues would be advisable."

This is critical for maintaining the existing functionality of the method while preventing the exception from occurring.\n\n1. **Implement a Pre-check for `self.raw`**: Before the loop that reads from `self.raw`, introduce a condition to check if `self.raw` is `None`. If it is `None`, the method should either raise a more descriptive error that can help debug the reason `self.raw` is `None` or simply return, depending on what is considered appropriate based on how `iter_content` is used throughout `requests`.\n\n2. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**: In the scenario where `self.raw` is `None`, and it's decided that raising an error is too disruptive, logging a warning might be a suitable alternative. This warning should indicate that the content could not be read due to an unexpected `None` value in `self.raw`, providing insight during debugging or analysis of logs without necessarily halting execution.\n\nThis approach would preserve the existing functionality for all cases where `self.raw` is not `None`, adding a safety net to prevent the `AttributeError` when `self.raw` is unexpectedly `None`. This solution also has the advantage of being a minimal change that does not disrupt the current logic flow or performance of the method.\n\nGiven the change is proposed within `requests/models.py`, it's also important to consider that this file is part of the external `requests` library. Thus, modifications should ideally be made by contributing to the library itself or working around the issue in the calling code if modification of the external library is not feasible.\n"
