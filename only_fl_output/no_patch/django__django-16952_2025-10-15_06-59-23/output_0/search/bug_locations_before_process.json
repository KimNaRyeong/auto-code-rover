        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure that when saving objects with nested multi-table inheritance, all parent objects are correctly identified and saved without errors. The `_save_parents` method should include a more robust handling mechanism for fields especially when dealing with objects that have complex inheritance chains, ensuring that fields like the `OneToOneField` used to link parent and child models in MTI setups have their attributes like `attname` correctly accessed and processed. This may involve catching exceptions where `attname` is not found and either providing a fallback method of identifying the field or ensuring that the model's meta information is fully prepared before `_save_parents` attempts to process it."

        "intended_behavior": "Adjustment here could involve ensuring that during object creation and saving, all relationship fields, particularly those involved in MTI scenarios, correctly report their attributes and are fully compatible with how parent models are saved. This might include ensuring `attname` and other critical attributes are always accessible and correctly reflect the field's relationship in the database, especially in complex inheritance cases."
