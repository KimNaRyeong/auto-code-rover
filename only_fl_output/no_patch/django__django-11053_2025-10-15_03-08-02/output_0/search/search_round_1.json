        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can observe the following about each part of the code and its relevance to the issue:\n\n### `configure` Method in `django/conf/__init__.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `configure` method in the `LazySettings` class is designed to manually set settings. It takes a `default_settings` parameter and any number of keyword arguments (`**options`). Each keyword argument represents a setting name and its value. The method initializes a `UserSettingsHolder` instance with the `default_settings`, then iterates over all items in `options` to set them on the `UserSettingsHolder` instance using `setattr`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   There is no check to ensure that setting names (keys from `**options`) are uppercase, contradicting the documentation that states setting names should be uppercase. This oversight enables the issue where non-uppercase settings can be set without error.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   Ideally, the `configure` method should validate setting names in `**options`, ensuring they are uppercase. If a setting name is not uppercase, the method could raise an appropriate error (e.g., `ValueError`) to prevent configuration with incorrect setting names.\n\n### `UserSettingsHolder` Class and its `__getattr__` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `UserSettingsHolder` class serves as a container for settings. Its `__getattr__` method attempts to retrieve an attribute (setting) value, first checking if the name is in `_deleted` (to handle attribute deletion) and then attempting to get the attribute from `default_settings` if it's not a directly set attribute of the instance.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   Similar to `configure`, the `__getattr__` method in `UserSettingsHolder` does not enforce any restriction on the case of setting names. This means it can retrieve non-uppercase settings, which is part of the bug described.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   The `__getattr__` method should perhaps enforce or respect some convention or restriction related to the case of the setting names. However, enforcing uppercase requirement here might not be correct as it's primarily concerned with retrieving settings, not enforcing policy on their naming.\n\nGiven this analysis, the critical part requiring a patch is the `configure` method in the `LazySettings` class. An appropriate fix would introduce a validation step to ensure all setting names in `**options` are uppercase before proceeding to set them on the `UserSettingsHolder` instance."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This can be achieved by iterating over the keys in `**options` and checking if `name.isupper()` returns `True` for each. If any key fails this check, a `ValueError` (or another appropriate exception) should be raised with a message indicating that all settings names must be uppercase. This validation should happen before any settings are actually set on the `UserSettingsHolder` to prevent partial configuration with valid uppercase settings before encountering a non-uppercase setting. This approach enforces the documentation's requirement directly in the configuration process, preventing the misuse of the settings framework with lowercase names."
