        "intended_behavior": "Before setting each setting from **options on the UserSettingsHolder instance, configure should validate that every key (setting name) in **options is uppercase. This can be achieved by iterating over the keys in **options and checking if name.isupper() returns True for each. If any key fails this check, a ValueError (or another appropriate exception) should be raised with a message indicating that all settings names must be uppercase. This validation should happen before any settings are actually set on the UserSettingsHolder to prevent partial configuration with valid uppercase settings before encountering a non-uppercase setting. This approach enforces the documentation's requirement directly in the configuration process, preventing the misuse of the settings framework with lowercase names."
