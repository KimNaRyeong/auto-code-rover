This script tries to directly set and retrieve non-uppercase settings in `settings.configure()` as described in the issue. It anticipates an `AssertionError` to signal that non-uppercase settings shouldn't have been allowed, which follows from the expected Django settings behavior as documented. The special handling for `AssertionError` and other exceptions ensures that a stack trace is printed, showing exactly where the issue arises for non-uppercase settings. Exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed aligns with the requirement where no assertion or unexpected error occurs.
