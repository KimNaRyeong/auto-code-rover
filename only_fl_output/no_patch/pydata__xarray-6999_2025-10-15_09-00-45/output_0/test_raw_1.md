Given the requirements and taking into account the previous attempt, here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to explicitly address the reported issue with renaming variables to dimension coordinates in `xarray` and check for index creation, aiming to accurately reproduce and diagnose the problem.

```python
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
        data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})

        assert "x" in data_renamed.indexes, "Expected 'x' to be in indexes, but it wasn't found."

        data_renamed.sel(x=2)  # This line should work if the index was created successfully.

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Selection by 'x' failed due to missing index for coordinate.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    else:
        print("Test passed: The index exists, and selection by 'x' works as expected.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated script includes an `AssertionError` if the provided condition (expectation for the index to exist after renaming) is not met, as well as handling for `KeyError` arising from failed selection attempts due to the missing index. It utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to provide clear error output if the test does not pass as expected. This should properly trigger and demonstrate the reported issue when it's present, and confirm resolution when fixed.
