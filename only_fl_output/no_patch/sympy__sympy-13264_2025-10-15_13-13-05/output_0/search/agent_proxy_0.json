As the submitter outlined a potential solution involving modifications to the `simplify` function, we should focus on gathering context around this specific function and any relevant surrounding code. Thus, the following API calls will be useful for obtaining the required information:\n\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`: This will help us locate the `simplify` function within the SymPy codebase.\n- `search_code(\"def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\")`: This specific line of code provided by the submitter seems to be their suggestion for modifying the `simplify` function, which means we need to find if the current implementation in the repository matches or how it differs from this suggestion."
