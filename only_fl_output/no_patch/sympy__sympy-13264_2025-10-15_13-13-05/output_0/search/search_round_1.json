Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls:\n\n1. The `simplify` method appears across multiple files in the SymPy codebase, indicating its widespread use and importance in different contexts, such as logic, vector operations, matrix operations, physics, special functions, core expressions, and polynomial domains. The presence of `simplify` in these diverse files suggests it's a core utility function used for expression simplification across different mathematical domains in SymPy.\n\n2. The specific search for the modified version of the `simplify` method, as suggested by the issue submitter, yielded no results. This indicates that the current implementation of `simplify` in the codebase does not yet include the suggested parameters (`ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0`). The absence implies that the proposed enhancement or bug fix, which involves adding an optional recursive mode controlled by `max_rec_steps`, has not been implemented.\n\nGiven these outcomes, the next steps should focus on obtaining the current implementation details of the `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, as it's likely the central implementation affecting the reported issue. This can help answer the following questions based on the issue description:\n\n1. **Current Implementation and Behavior**: What is the current signature and implementation of `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`? Understanding this will clarify how it operates now and what strategies it employs for simplification.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: Since the issue implies that `simplify` does not fully factorize expressions on the first call but does so upon a second call, examining the existing logic will reveal why some simplification strategies might only apply or fully succeed after an initial simplification pass. This relates to the recursive enhancement proposed by the submitter.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `simplify` should be capable of recognizing when further simplification is possible and performing it in a single call. The issue suggests that by allowing a recursive simplification mode, where `simplify` can be applied again based on a measure of the expression's complexity (`measure` function) and a predefined `max_rec_steps`, the function would more thoroughly simplify expressions upon a single invocation.\n\nTo proceed, focusing on the implementation in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is essential. Therefore, the necessary API calls would include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")`: to retrieve the details of `simplify`'s implementation.\n- Optionally, understanding how `measure` and `shorter` functions are defined and used could also be insightful, requiring additional searches if they are not part of the `simplify` method's implementation details. This would entail calling `search_method(\"measure\")` and `search_method(\"shorter\")`, but let's first focus on the `simplify` method itself."
