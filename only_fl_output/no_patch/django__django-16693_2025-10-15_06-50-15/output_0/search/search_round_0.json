        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how the error occurs when a context processor returns the wrong type. The error traceback provided in the issue mentions several key points in the Django framework's codebase, particularly focusing on the handling of template context processors. Based on the details given, the relevant pieces of code seem to be in the `django/template/backends/django.py` and `django/template/context.py` files. We need to examine the code around where context processors are called and how their return values are integrated into the context.\n\nGiven the information in the issue, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `render` method in the file `django/template/backends/django.py` to understand how Django templates are rendered and where the context processors are integrated.\n2. Search for the location where the context processor's return value is handled in `django/template/context.py`. The error message refers to an `update` step which seems crucial for integrating context processor output into the template context.\n3. Since the issue suggests wrapping the update logic in a try/except block to handle incorrect return types gracefully, investigating the current implementation of `bind_template` in `django/template/context.py` will be necessary, as it's directly mentioned in the stack trace.\n\nLet's perform these search API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file('render', 'django/template/backends/django.py')`\n- `search_method_in_file('bind_template', 'django/template/context.py')`"
