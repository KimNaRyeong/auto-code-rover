        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, it would be beneficial to first locate where numeric expressions, specifically those involving the MOD operator, are being processed within the Django codebase. This involves looking for classes and methods that handle expressions, as well as checking where the type resolution (e.g., resolving to Decimal) happens for numeric results. Here are the API calls that will provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for handling expressions, often this could be something like `Expression` or a more specific class for numeric operations:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Expression\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with the MOD operator, it's critical to find where the MOD operation is defined or handled:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"mod\")\n```\n\n3. The issue description suggests there might be a mismatch in handling types (Decimal and Integer) when doing MOD operations. Hence, searching for any subclass or utility handling type resolution or casting can be useful:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"DecimalField\")\n```\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"IntegerField\")\n```\n\n4. Lastly, finding code snippets that involve the MOD operator could give insight into its current implementation or usage:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"MOD\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to map out the areas in the codebase where modifications might be needed to resolve the issue, including finding the relevant classes, methods, and any existing logic handling the MOD operator, especially in relation to numeric types."
