Here are the API calls that will provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for handling expressions, often this could be something like `Expression` or a more specific class for numeric operations:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Expression\")\n```\n\n2.

Hence, searching for any subclass or utility handling type resolution or casting can be useful:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"DecimalField\")\n```\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"IntegerField\")\n```\n\n4. Lastly, finding code snippets that involve the MOD operator could give insight into its current implementation or usage:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"MOD\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to map out the areas in the codebase where modifications might be needed to resolve the issue, including finding the relevant classes, methods, and any existing logic handling the MOD operator, especially in relation to numeric types."

It's plausible that modifications or enhancements in this area could address the type resolution issue mentioned.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, this class or its subclasses/methods responsible for arithmetic operations should correctly handle type casting or resolution when performing operations between different numeric types, ensuring operations like MOD return the correct type (Decimal, in this case).\n\n2. **No direct method `mod` found**\n\n- **What it implies:** The absence of a directly named `mod` method suggests that the MOD operation might be implemented under different naming conventions, possibly as part of a more generic method handling various arithmetic operations, or as a backend-specific implementation detail.\n- **Next steps**: It might be necessary to look into methods that evaluate or construct SQL queries in `expressions.py` or related files, or even within database backend-specific files to find where the MOD operation is formulated and executed.\n\n3. **DecimalField and IntegerField in model fields**\n\n- **What they do:** These classes define the behavior, validation, and database interactions for decimal and integer fields of models, respectively.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue concerns these two types of fields when used in arithmetic expressions, particularly the MOD operation. Understanding these classes' implementation can provide insights into how type casting or conversion is handled and where adjustments might be needed to fix the issue.\n- **Intended behavior:** Both fields should correctly handle arithmetic operations between each other, ensuring accurate type casting and resolution. For example, a MOD operation between a DecimalField and IntegerField should return a DecimalField if that's the precise expected behavior.\n\n4. **Occurrences of `MOD` in the codebase**\n\n- **What it implies:** The widespread occurrence of `MOD` in various files might initially seem irrelevant, but specifically, its appearance in files like `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/functions/math.py` could be highly relevant for addressing the issue.\n- **Next steps**: Focus on these specific files to locate the implementation of arithmetic operations, particularly looking for any custom handling or function definitions related to the MOD operator and how types are inferred or cast in the process.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps involve diving deeper into how Django handles arithmetic expressions, especially the MOD operator in the context of different numeric field types. This requires examining the implementation in `expressions.py` and possibly exploring related mathematical functions or utility methods that might deal with type resolution for arithmetic operations. Specifically, we should look at the code in `django/db/models/expressions.py` and any relevant methods that apply to constructing or executing arithmetic expressions involving DecimalField and IntegerField inputs."

Therefore, it's necessary to obtain more detailed context regarding the handling of arithmetic operations, particularly involving the MOD function and type casting.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"get_prep_value\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"django/db/models/expressions.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"class CombinedExpression(\", \"django/db/models/expressions.py\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"resolve_expression\", \"Expression\")\n```\n\n2. **Bug locations:**\n\nGiven the provided results and without additional specific context from the proposed searches, preliminary locations for potential adjustments include:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n  - **Class:** `Expression` or potentially a subclass specifically dealing with arithmetic operations.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that when combining DecimalField and IntegerField in an arithmetic operation involving MOD, the expression system is capable of dynamically determining the correct output field type. Specifically, if either operand is a DecimalField, the result should potentially be cast to Decimal to preserve precision, unless explicitly cast otherwise. This behavior should be consistent with how other arithmetic operations handle type resolution and maintain the existing functionality and type safety principles of Django's ORM.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **Intended behavior for a new method or utility:** Depending on the outcome of further context gathering, a new method or utility within the `Expression` class or relevant subclass might be needed to accurately resolve types for operations like MOD. This method would check the field types involved in the operation and explicitly set the `output_field` to DecimalField if any operand is a DecimalField, ensuring consistent type resolution across different database backends. This approach must be database-agnostic, leveraging Django's abstraction layers to ensure compatibility across supported databases.\n\nWithout the precise insights provided by further specific context, these locations and intended behaviors are hypothesized based on the general description of the issue and understanding of Django's model and expressions architecture. Actual adjustments might vary based on deeper codebase insights."
