This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\nPython 3.6, PostgreSQL 9.6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the described issue, we will need to explore the models' definitions, their inheritance mechanism, and any related save or create methods that might be involved in triggering the extra query behavior when a custom primary key is used. The issue specifically mentions the behavior during object creation for models utilizing multi-inheritance and a custom primary key field. We'll focus our search on the classes `Parent` and `Child`, and any custom save/create methods that might be interacting with the database.\n\n1. Find the `Parent` and `Child` classes to understand how they are defined and if there are any custom methods that might influence the creation process:\n   - `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Child\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an extra query during object creation, it's relevant to look for overridden save methods in these models which could be where the logic causing the extra query resides:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`\n\n3. The issue also mentions the use of a custom primary key (`UUIDField`) in the `Parent` class which is crucial to the problem. It would be useful to find its definition:\n   - `search_code(\"models.UUIDField\")`\n\n4. Lastly, investigating if the Django version or the database (PostgreSQL) has specific known issues or optimizations regarding multi-table inheritance with custom primary keys could also be helpful. This step would involve external research outside the codebase so it won't be represented by an API call here.\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary information to understand how the models and their creation process are implemented, and potentially pinpoint where the extra query is being triggered from."
