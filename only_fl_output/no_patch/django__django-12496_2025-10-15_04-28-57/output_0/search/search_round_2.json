This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2.

The issue specifically mentions the behavior during object creation for models utilizing multi-inheritance and a custom primary key field. We'll focus our search on the classes `Parent` and `Child`, and any custom save/create methods that might be interacting with the database.\n\n1. Find the `Parent` and `Child` classes to understand how they are defined and if there are any custom methods that might influence the creation process:\n   - `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Child\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an extra query during object creation, it's relevant to look for overridden save methods in these models which could be where the logic causing the extra query resides:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`\n\n3. The issue also mentions the use of a custom primary key (`UUIDField`) in the `Parent` class which is crucial to the problem. It would be useful to find its definition:\n   - `search_code(\"models.UUIDField\")`\n\n4. Lastly, investigating if the Django version or the database (PostgreSQL) has specific known issues or optimizations regarding multi-table inheritance with custom primary keys could also be helpful. This step would involve external research outside the codebase so it won't be represented by an API call here.\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary information to understand how the models and their creation process are implemented, and potentially pinpoint where the extra query is being triggered from."

This does not directly relate to the bug but gives us insight into how `UUIDField` is recognized as a field type within Django's ecosystem, specifically in utility and widget configurations.\n\nGiven this analysis, we need to redirect our strategy to:\n- Look for any possible custom save or creation methods that might not be directly tied to the `Parent` or `Child` class names but are involved in the creation process within multi-inheritance model scenarios.\n- Consider searching for key Django model lifecycle methods or signals such as `pre_save`, `post_save`, or methods related to model instantiation and saving that could interact with inheritance and primary keys differently when a custom primary key is used.\n\nNext steps based on current analysis:\n1. Since the model classes were not found directly, it might be beneficial to look into how the models are being saved or created more generally within the Django application. This could lead to insights into where the extra query might be generated from.\n\n2. Given the UUIDField context found, we could try to understand any custom behaviors or configurations in the Django project that might lead to the observed issue, although so far, we have not directly identified such a mechanism. \n\n3.

        "content": "Given the results from the search methods for `save` and `create`, let's analyze:\n\n### `save` Method Context\n\n1. **What This Part of the Code Does:**\n   - The `save` method appears across different Django components, including forms, models, and sessions. Generally, this method is responsible for saving or updating an instance in the database. In models, it handles creating new records or updating existing ones, managing any necessary pre-save or post-save operations.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug:**\n   - The bug involves an extra database query when creating an instance of a model that inherits from another model with a custom primary key (`UUIDField`). The problem likely resides within the `save` method(s) used by Django models (`django/db/models/base.py` might be particularly relevant), where the saving mechanism differs based on the presence of a custom primary key.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior of the Code:**\n   - Ideally, when creating a `Child` instance (that inherits from `Parent`), Django should only insert records without needing to update the parent table immediately after creating it. The intended behavior would ensure that inheritance with a custom primary key works seamlessly, without redundant updates that set fields to empty values.\n\n### `create` Method Context\n\n1. **What This Part of the Code Does:**\n   - The `create` method is primarily found within Django's ORM layer, specifically in QuerySet operations and model field descriptors. It facilitates the creation of model instances and their immediate saving to the database without requiring a separate `save` call.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug:**\n   - The bug might not directly relate to the `create` function itself but how the creation process interacts with the model's inheritance structure, especially regarding the custom primary key. However, the mechanics of `create`, especially in `django/db/models/query.py`, could influence how inherited fields are populated and saved in multi-table inheritance scenarios.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior of the Code:**\n   - The `create` method should handle model instance creation in such a way that inherited fields, particularly those involving custom primary keys, are correctly initialized without necessitating an additional update query. It should ensure the atomic creation of both parent and child model instances, preserving the efficiency and integrity of the database operations.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nSeeing that the involved locations are spread across Django's foundational components, pinpointing the exact source of the bug requires examining how Django's model inheritance and field initialization logic interact with custom primary keys.\n\nTo more directly address the described issue, focusing on how Django's model system handles:\n- Multi-table inheritance (`django/db/models/base.py` could be key here).\n- The initialization and saving sequence of model instances with custom primary keys.\n\nA deeper inspection into the `save` method within `django/db/models/base.py` and the `create` method within `django/db/models/query.py` might offer the most direct insight into resolving the issue without impacting other functionalities.\n\nGiven the broad reach of the `save` and `create` mechanisms in Django, any modification or patch must be crafted carefully to avoid unintended side effects, especially considering Django's wide use across numerous projects. The patch should ensure that multi-table inheritance behaves as expected when custom primary keys are defined, eliminating unnecessary database operations."

If a custom primary key is present, Django should insert the parent and child records in one operation where possible and avoid any unnecessary update queries that set fields to empty values immediately after the insert. The method should handle both cases (with and without custom primary keys) efficiently, without hindering the performance or functionality for other model instances.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n     - **Class:** Not explicitly mentioned, likely related to `QuerySet` or a similar class that handles object creation.\n     - **Method:** `create`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The `create` method should specifically ensure that when a new object is instantiated via multi-table inheritance, all fields from the parent and child models are correctly populated before the initial save. It should circumvent any extra updates to the parent model fields when a custom primary key is used. Ensuring that the creation process is atomic and efficient when custom primary keys are involved, without requiring an additional update step, is crucial.\n\nThese locations are suggested based on the given issue description and the nature of Django's model inheritance and field management. Direct inspection and potentially further testing would be required to confirm the exact nature and location of the bug within Django's model saving and creation mechanisms. The proposed intended behaviors aim to resolve the issue of unnecessary database queries while preserving existing functionalities and the overall integrity of Django's ORM operations."
