        "content": "To obtain the necessary context to address the issue of the `DatabaseCache` backend not quoting all fields in queries with compatibility for Snowflake's requirement for quoted fields, we should start by locating the `DatabaseCache` class in the codebase. This will give us a starting point to understand how queries are formed and where the quoting might be missing or insufficient. Finding the class will also allow us to identify important methods that construct or execute database queries, which are likely places to introduce necessary changes.\n\nGiven the task, my plan to gather sufficient code context is as follows:\n\n1. **Search for the `DatabaseCache` class.** This is the central piece to the issue, and understanding its structure and associated methods will be crucial.\n2. **Locate methods related to query construction or execution.** These methods are likely where we will need to implement quoting of fields.\n\nTherefore, my set of API calls will start with:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DatabaseCache\")` - To find the class definition.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"make_key\", \"DatabaseCache\")` - Assuming `make_key` might be relevant for key handling in caching, and key generation could involve query operations where quoting is necessary.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"add\", \"DatabaseCache\")` - To look into how items are added to the cache, as this operation could involve constructing queries that should quote fields.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"DatabaseCache\")` - Given that retrieving items from the cache likely involves database queries where the issue could manifest.\n\nThese initial API calls should provide a broad overview of how the `DatabaseCache` backend interacts with the database and where quoting of fields should be enforced for compatibility with Snowflake."
