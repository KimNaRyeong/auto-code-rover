[We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "The issue mentions being stuck with SymPy version 1.5.1 due to dependency requirements specified in the `requirements.txt` file of the Devito project. The user is inquiring about the release of SymPy 1.6.1, indicating that patches submitted by their team have been merged into the SymPy master branch. However, without specific details about the patches or areas of SymPy they relate to, it's challenging to invoke the search APIs effectively for relevant code context.\n\nTo understand the nature of these patches or the areas of SymPy they might impact, one would typically look into the SymPy master branch for changes made after the 1.6 release or review the history of pull requests and merges around the time mentioned. Unfortunately, this task would require access to the version control history of the SymPy project, which is beyond the capability of the provided search APIs.\n\nGiven this limitation and the lack of specific information about classes, methods, or code snippets affected by the patches in question, I'm unable to execute any search API calls that would yield meaningful results related to the issue at hand. \n\nA more productive approach to gather context for resolving this issue would involve:\n1. Identifying the specific patches submitted by the team, possibly by referencing their pull request numbers or commit messages in the SymPy repository.\n2. Once the patches or areas of the code are identified, one could use the search APIs to explore the related classes, methods, and code snippets to ensure compatibility or address any remaining issues before the release of 1.6.1.\n\nIf additional information is provided, such as names of classes or methods impacted by the patches, I could utilize the search APIs effectively to gather the necessary code context."
