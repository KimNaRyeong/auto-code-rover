However, given the nature of the initial inquiry, I will provide a modified version of \"reproducer.py\" that corresponds to your original intentions, assuming a correct environment is in place for the test to run as expected. Please ensure that your Python environment has `scikit-learn` properly installed and is not encountering import errors as seen in the previous execution log.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV\n    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression\n\n    try:\n        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=2, noise=0.1)\n        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)\n        print(\"Test completed successfully, issue not detected.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        if \"Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed\" in str(e):\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            raise AssertionError(\"Problem detected: Integers in RidgeCV alphas cause an error.\")\n        else:\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            raise AssertionError(\"An unexpected error occurred.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        main()\n    except AssertionError as error:\n        print(error)\n        exit(1)\n    exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script is designed to reproduce the issue where using integers in the `alphas` parameter of `RidgeCV` causes a `ValueError` related to raising integers to negative powers. It should only fail (exit with code 1 and raise an `AssertionError`) if the specific problem (as described) is encountered. In other scenarios, including a successful run or encountering a different issue, the behavior will vary as described by the comments and handling within the script.\n\nPlease ensure:\n\n1. The environment where you execute this script has `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn` installed with versions compatible with Python 3.6, as mentioned.\n2. There're no underlying issues related to the sklearn installation itself, like the import error reported previously, which suggests a problem with the sklearn build or environment rather than with the code snippet provided."
