Regularization\n1156         improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of\n1157         the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.\n1158         Alpha corresponds to ``C^-1`` in other linear models such as\n1159         LogisticRegression or LinearSVC.\n1160 \n1161     fit_intercept : boolean\n1162         Whether to calculate the intercept for this model.

        "intended_behavior": "Within the RidgeCV class or one of its parent class methods that handle the alphas parameter, ensure that all elements in the alphas list are converted to float. This conversion could happen either in the __init__ method where alphas is initially processed or in a method that is directly involved in the computation where the error occurs (e.g., during fitting). The conversion logic should check if the provided alphas are integers and convert them to floats. This allows the numerical computations that involve alphas to proceed without encountering the 'Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed' error. This change needs to be implemented in a way that does not affect other functionalities or expected input types for alphas (i.e., allowing for both single values and lists of floats/integers). After this change, the RidgeCV class should be able to handle lists of integers for alphas by automatically converting them to floats internally, thus resolving the reported issue without requiring the user to manually adjust their input."
