This class is part of scikit-learn's linear modeling toolkit and presumably implements the Ridge regression with cross-validation.\n\nGiven the issue description:\n1. **What this part of the code does**: The `RidgeCV` class likely implements functionality for performing Ridge regression, where `alphas` is a parameter representing the regularization strength(s). The class automatically tunes the best alpha value from the provided list using cross-validation.\n2. **The relationship between this part of the code and the bug**: The bug arises when the `alphas` parameter consists entirely of integers, leading to a `ValueError` during fitting. The issue suggests that converting at least one alpha value to float internally could fix this problem. The bug might be located in the method(s) that handle the fitting and validation process, especially where the alpha values are utilized.\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code**: Ideally, the `RidgeCV` class should handle both integers and floats in the `alphas` list gracefully. It should not raise an error when all values are integers but rather should convert them to floats internally, as needed, to prevent any computational errors during fitting.\n\nTo get more context and find the exact location of the bug, subsequent API calls should target methods related to initialization (to see how `alphas` are handled) and fitting processes within the `RidgeCV` class in `sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py`. This would likely include looking into methods like `__init__`, `fit`, or any other method that deals with `alphas` directly."
