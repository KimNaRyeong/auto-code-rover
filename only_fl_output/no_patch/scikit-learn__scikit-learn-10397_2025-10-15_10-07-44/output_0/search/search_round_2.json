This class is part of scikit-learn's linear modeling toolkit and presumably implements the Ridge regression with cross-validation.\n\nGiven the issue description:\n1. **What this part of the code does**: The `RidgeCV` class likely implements functionality for performing Ridge regression, where `alphas` is a parameter representing the regularization strength(s). The class automatically tunes the best alpha value from the provided list using cross-validation.\n2. **The relationship between this part of the code and the bug**: The bug arises when the `alphas` parameter consists entirely of integers, leading to a `ValueError` during fitting. The issue suggests that converting at least one alpha value to float internally could fix this problem. The bug might be located in the method(s) that handle the fitting and validation process, especially where the alpha values are utilized.\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code**: Ideally, the `RidgeCV` class should handle both integers and floats in the `alphas` list gracefully. It should not raise an error when all values are integers but rather should convert them to floats internally, as needed, to prevent any computational errors during fitting.\n\nTo get more context and find the exact location of the bug, subsequent API calls should target methods related to initialization (to see how `alphas` are handled) and fitting processes within the `RidgeCV` class in `sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py`. This would likely include looking into methods like `__init__`, `fit`, or any other method that deals with `alphas` directly."

This suggests that either these methods are inherited from a parent class without being overridden in `RidgeCV` or that the handling of the `alphas` parameter and the fitting process occurs elsewhere.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** - Since we couldn't directly locate the methods, it's reasonable to assume that the `RidgeCV` class inherits significant functionality from its parent classes, which manage initialization and the fitting process, including the handling of the `alphas` parameter.\n\n2. **The relationship between this part of the code and the bug**: The inability to find these methods directly in `RidgeCV` indicates that the bug might be located in the inherited functionality from parent classes or in utility functions used by `RidgeCV`. The parent class or utility functions likely handle the conversion or application of the `alphas` parameter in a way that doesn't account for all `alphas` being integers.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, the intended behavior of this part of the code**: The code should automatically convert integer alpha values to floats to avoid computational errors related to integer to negative integer powers, as mentioned in the issue. This ensures that users don't need to manually convert integer alphas to floats, making the `RidgeCV` more robust and user-friendly.\n\nGiven the results and analysis, it's clear we need more context, particularly around where `RidgeCV` inherits its core functionality and how the `alphas` parameter is processed. Since the direct search for `fit` and `__init__` did not yield results within `RidgeCV`, the next step is to look into the parent classes or related utility functions. \n\n1. search_class(\"RegressorMixin\")\n2. search_class(\"_BaseRidgeCV\")"

Since we have not been able to directly locate the bug through the provided API calls, but based on the information available from the issue and the known structure of scikit-learn, we can hypothesize where the bug might be located and describe the intended behavior needed to resolve the issue.\n\n**Bug Location Hypothesis:**\n- **File**: `sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py`\n- **Class**: `RidgeCV`\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\n- Within the `RidgeCV` class or one of its parent class methods that handle the `alphas` parameter, ensure that all elements in the `alphas` list are converted to float. This conversion could happen either in the `__init__` method where `alphas` is initially processed or in a method that is directly involved in the computation where the error occurs (e.g., during fitting).\n- The conversion logic should check if the provided `alphas` are integers and convert them to floats. This allows the numerical computations that involve `alphas` to proceed without encountering the \"Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed\" error.\n- This change needs to be implemented in a way that does not affect other functionalities or expected input types for `alphas` (i.e., allowing for both single values and lists of floats/integers).\n- After this change, the `RidgeCV` class should be able to handle lists of integers for `alphas` by automatically converting them to floats internally, thus resolving the reported issue without requiring the user to manually adjust their input.\n\nSince the direct search for relevant methods and parent classes did not yield concrete paths to explore, this hypothetical resolution is aimed at where such a bug fix might be implemented based on the description of the issue. Further investigation and testing would be needed to identify the exact location and implement the fix accordingly."
