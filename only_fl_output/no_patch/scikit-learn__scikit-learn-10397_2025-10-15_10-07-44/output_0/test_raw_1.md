Based on your request, it appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the result of the test. However, given the nature of the initial inquiry, I will provide a modified version of "reproducer.py" that corresponds to your original intentions, assuming a correct environment is in place for the test to run as expected. Please ensure that your Python environment has `scikit-learn` properly installed and is not encountering import errors as seen in the previous execution log.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

    try:
        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=2, noise=0.1)
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        print("Test completed successfully, issue not detected.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Problem detected: Integers in RidgeCV alphas cause an error.")
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script is designed to reproduce the issue where using integers in the `alphas` parameter of `RidgeCV` causes a `ValueError` related to raising integers to negative powers. It should only fail (exit with code 1 and raise an `AssertionError`) if the specific problem (as described) is encountered. In other scenarios, including a successful run or encountering a different issue, the behavior will vary as described by the comments and handling within the script.

Please ensure:

1. The environment where you execute this script has `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn` installed with versions compatible with Python 3.6, as mentioned.
2. There're no underlying issues related to the sklearn installation itself, like the import error reported previously, which suggests a problem with the sklearn build or environment rather than with the code snippet provided.
