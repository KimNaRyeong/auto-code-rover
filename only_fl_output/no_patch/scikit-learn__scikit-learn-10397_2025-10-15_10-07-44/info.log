1143 class RidgeCV(_BaseRidgeCV, RegressorMixin):
1144     """Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation.
1145 
1146     By default, it performs Generalized Cross-Validation, which is a form of
1147     efficient Leave-One-Out cross-validation.
1148 
1149     Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ridge_regression>`.
1150 
1151     Parameters
1152     ----------
1153     alphas : numpy array of shape [n_alphas]
1154         Array of alpha values to try.
1155         Regularization strength; must be a positive float. Regularization
1156         improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of
1157         the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.
1158         Alpha corresponds to ``C^-1`` in other linear models such as
1159         LogisticRegression or LinearSVC.
1160 
1161     fit_intercept : boolean
1162         Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
1163         to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
1164         (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).
1165 
1166     normalize : boolean, optional, default False
1167         This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
1168         If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
1169         subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
1170         If you wish to standardize, please use
1171         :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit``
1172         on an estimator with ``normalize=False``.
1173 
1174     scoring : string, callable or None, optional, default: None
1175         A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
1176         a scorer callable object / function with signature
1177         ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.
1178 
1179     cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
1180         Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
1181         Possible inputs for cv are:
1182 
1183         - None, to use the efficient Leave-One-Out cross-validation
1184         - integer, to specify the number of folds.
1185         - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
1186         - An iterable yielding train/test splits.
1187 
1188         For integer/None inputs, if ``y`` is binary or multiclass,
1189         :class:`sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` is used, else,
1190         :class:`sklearn.model_selection.KFold` is used.
1191 
1192         Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
1193         cross-validation strategies that can be used here.
1194 
1195     gcv_mode : {None, 'auto', 'svd', eigen'}, optional
1196         Flag indicating which strategy to use when performing
1197         Generalized Cross-Validation. Options are::
1198 
1199             'auto' : use svd if n_samples > n_features or when X is a sparse
1200                      matrix, otherwise use eigen
1201             'svd' : force computation via singular value decomposition of X
1202                     (does not work for sparse matrices)
1203             'eigen' : force computation via eigendecomposition of X^T X
1204 
1205         The 'auto' mode is the default and is intended to pick the cheaper
1206         option of the two depending upon the shape and format of the training
1207         data.
1208 
1209     store_cv_values : boolean, default=False
1210         Flag indicating if the cross-validation values corresponding to
1211         each alpha should be stored in the `cv_values_` attribute (see
1212         below). This flag is only compatible with `cv=None` (i.e. using
1213         Generalized Cross-Validation).
1214 
1215     Attributes
1216     ----------
1217     cv_values_ : array, shape = [n_samples, n_alphas] or \
1218         shape = [n_samples, n_targets, n_alphas], optional
1219         Cross-validation values for each alpha (if `store_cv_values=True` and \
1220         `cv=None`). After `fit()` has been called, this attribute will \
1221         contain the mean squared errors (by default) or the values of the \
1222         `{loss,score}_func` function (if provided in the constructor).
1223 
1224     coef_ : array, shape = [n_features] or [n_targets, n_features]
1225         Weight vector(s).
1226 
1227     intercept_ : float | array, shape = (n_targets,)
1228         Independent term in decision function. Set to 0.0 if
1229         ``fit_intercept = False``.
1230 
1231     alpha_ : float
1232         Estimated regularization parameter.
