        "content": "To address the issue involving the `DurationField.clean` method failing to handle broken data and leading to a `ValueError`, I will need to gather more context on the related parts of the codebase. Given the traceback and the description of the problem, I will focus on the following elements:\n\n1. The `DurationField` class, especially the `clean` method.\n2. The `to_python` method which is likely a part of the `DurationField` class or closely related.\n3. The `parse_duration` function in `django/utils/dateparse.py`, as this is where the exception originates from.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls are needed to gather the required information:\n\n1. Search for the `DurationField` class within `django/forms/fields.py`.\n2. Search for the `clean` method within the `DurationField` class.\n3. Search for the `to_python` method within the `DurationField` class.\n4. Search for the `parse_duration` function in the entire codebase.\n5. Get code around the line where `parse_duration` function raises the exception due to handling the broken data.\n\nHence, the search API calls will be as follows:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"DurationField\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DurationField\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DurationField\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_duration\")`"
