        "intended_behavior": "This method should include enhanced error handling to gracefully reject malformed strings representing durations, such as 'P3(3D', that currently cause it to raise a ValueError. The improvement could involve more precise validation of the input format before attempting conversion. If an input does not match expected patterns for duration, parse_duration should not attempt to convert parts of the string into floats or other types, preventing the ValueError. Instead, it should return None or raise a more descriptive error that the input string does not match valid duration formats. This change will prevent DurationField in forms from encountering unexpected exceptions during data cleaning and validation."

        "intended_behavior": "While the main error handling improvement is within the parse_duration function, ensuring robustness at this level can be complemented by enhancing the to_python method to handle situations where parse_duration fails to parse a string and either returns None or raises a new, more descriptive exception. This method should catch such exceptions and convert them into meaningful ValidationError messages that inform users or developers about the incorrect input format. This dual approach of enhancing both parse_duration and to_python caters to both preventing and gracefully handling errors, preserving the functionality of interpreting valid duration inputs while also improving feedback on why certain inputs are invalid."
