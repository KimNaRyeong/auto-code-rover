        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location must be enhanced to allow the `gettext_compact` option not just to influence the granularity of compaction but also to enable a mode where all generated message catalogs can be merged into a single file. This single file would then be used for upload or further processing in a more streamlined manner. This enhancement would cater to uses cases like that of the OKFN people, who currently have to manually perform this step as per their `Makefile`. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the `gettext_compact` option. Introduce an additional value for `gettext_compact` or a separate configuration option that, when set, triggers the compacting of all message catalogs into a single file."
