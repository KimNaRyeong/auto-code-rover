Based on the issue description, it sounds like these directives are likely part of a documentation generator or a similar tool that processes text files. They might be defined in classes or methods related to rendering or processing markup language.\n\nFirst, let's identify any classes or methods that specifically handle the `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives, as well as any existing implementation of `:dedent:`. Since the issue description mentions the behavior being more akin to Python's `textwrap.dedent`, it's likely we are looking for parsing or text processing parts of the code.\n\n1. Search for the classes or methods handling the `code-block` directive:\n   - `search_method(\"code-block\")`\n   \n2. Search for the classes or methods handling the `literalinclude` directive:\n   - `search_method(\"literalinclude\")`\n\n3. Search for any existing implementation or handling of `:dedent:`:\n   - `search_code(\":dedent:\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by identifying relevant sections of the codebase."

It's likely that these terms are related to a documentation framework or a custom implementation within a larger project. Considering these directives are often associated with documentation processing tools like Sphinx, the actual implementation might be abstracted under different method names or within specific classes dedicated to handling document directives or text processing.\n\nLet's broaden the search to find more general parts of the code that could be responsible for handling documentation directives or text transformations. Here are some refined or additional queries to consider:\n\n1. **Search for classes related to document processing or directives handling.**\n   Since \"code-block\" and \"literalinclude\" are likely to be processed within a documentation context, finding classes responsible for document parsing or directive handling might help.\n   - `search_class(\"Directive\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DocumentProcessor\")`\n   - `search_class(\"TextProcessor\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods related to the processing of directives or blocks.**\n   There may be methods that are more generically named but are responsible for processing directives within documents.\n   - `search_method(\"process_directive\")`\n   - `search_method(\"handle_directive\")`\n\n3. **Search for code related to indentation processing.**\n   Given that \":dedent:\" refers to removing indentation, there may be more generically named code related to handling or adjusting text indentation.\n   - `search_code(\"indentation\")`\n   - `search_code(\"remove_indent\")`\n\nThese queries aim to uncover areas of the code that handle document processing and specifically the manipulation of text layout, which includes directive processing and indentation adjustment.\n"
