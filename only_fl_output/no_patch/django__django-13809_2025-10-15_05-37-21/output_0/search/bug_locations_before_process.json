This new command-line option allows the developer to indicate that system checks should not be performed when the server is started with this command. The implementation must ensure that, when this option is passed, the usual system check routine is bypassed, preserving all other functionalities intact."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the logic within the command execution flow to conditionally skip system checks if the `--skip-checks` flag is set. This could involve checking for the presence of the `--skip-checks` option in the command's options and skipping the relevant calls to perform system checks accordingly. It's crucial that this modification carefully avoids altering the command's behavior when the flag is not specified, ensuring that checks continue to run by default as per the existing functionality."
