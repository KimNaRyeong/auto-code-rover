        "content": "Analyzing the context from the `MigrationAutodetector` class found in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, we can deduce several key points that will guide our investigation and eventual resolution of the issue described. The `MigrationAutodetector` class is evidently central to Django's migration system, particularly in detecting changes in models that necessitate the generation of new migrations.\n\n### Analysis of the `MigrationAutodetector` Class\n\n1. **Responsibilities**: The `MigrationAutodetector` class is tasked with detecting model changes that require new migrations. It contains methods for generating a variety of migrations, including creating and deleting models, adding and removing fields, and altering model options. This functionality indicates that it plays a critical role in analyzing the current state of models compared to their last migration state and determining what new migrations should be made.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The bug is related to how new migration files are numbered, especially in the presence of squashed migrations. Although `MigrationAutodetector` does not directly deal with the file naming or numbering, it is involved in the process that leads up to that point\u2014the detection of changes and the preparation of migration actions. Understanding how `MigrationAutodetector` works can provide insights into where the numbering logic might get its input and how the presence of squashed migrations might affect that logic.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue, the intended behavior would be for the migration system to correctly sequence new migrations after the highest numbered existing migration, including those that result from squashing. This implies an understanding and analysis of the existing migration graph, determining the highest current migration, and appropriately naming new migrations in sequence, regardless of squashes.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, it appears we need to look closer into how migrations are sequenced and named after being detected. Since the direct search for `makemigrations` and `generate_migration_name` methods yielded no results, we should consider a more indirect approach. We need to understand how Django tracks and manages the chain of migrations, especially in the context of squashed migrations. This would likely involve the management of migration dependencies and the generation of migration files themselves.\n\nSuggested API Calls for Further Investigation:\n\n1. **Investigate Migration Naming or Sequencing Logic**: Since the `makemigrations` command did not lead us to a direct method, we should look for methods that deal with arranging migrations, managing dependencies, or the final step of writing migration files, which could potentially involve naming.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"arrange_for_graph\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"generate_migration_files\", \"django/db/migrations/writer.py\")  # Hypothetical method name\n```\n\n2. **Explore Migration File Generation**: Understanding how files themselves are generated and named could provide further insights. We assume that the file naming logic might be in a separate module responsible for the actual file output.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"MigrationWriter\")\n```\n\nThese steps aim to pinpoint the mechanism responsible for attributing numbers to migrations, especially in cases where squashed migrations may impact the expected numbering sequence."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Therefore, I will hypothesize based on the typical workflow of Django's migration system:\n\nLocation 1:\n- **File:** `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- **Class:** `MigrationAutodetector`\n- **Method:** `arrange_for_graph`\n- **Intended Behavior:** This method should ensure that when determining the graph arrangement for new migrations, it accurately accounts for squashed migrations. Specifically, it should always sequence new migrations by considering the highest numbered migration as the starting point, including both squashed and non-squashed migrations. This would mean enhancing the logic to recognize when a squashed migration encompasses other migrations and ensuring the numbering of subsequent migrations reflects the true latest point in the migration graph.\n\nLocation 2:\n- **File:** Not precisely identified yet (hypothetically `django/db/migrations/writer.py` or similar)\n- **Class:** `MigrationWriter` (or the class responsible for generating the migration file)\n- **Intended Behavior:** If this class or its equivalent exists, and is responsible for naming and writing the migration file to disk, it should implement logic that correctly identifies the next sequential migration number in the context of existing and squashed migrations. This means either augmenting how migration names are generated to ensure they follow sequentially after the highest numbered migration (accounting for squashes), or ensuring that the interpretation of the current migration environment accurately reflects the squashed migrations.\n\nIn summary, while specific bug locations need additional context for pinpointing, the intended behavior corrections focus on ensuring migration numbering considers the entire migration history accurately, especially in handling squashed migrations. This approach aims to maintain existing functionality while correcting the numbering sequence anomaly highlighted in the issue."
