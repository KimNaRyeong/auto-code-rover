It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to the Django migration system where the `makemigrations` command generates incorrectly numbered migration files under certain circumstances, we need to gather context on how Django manages migration files, specifically focusing on how it decides the numbering for new migration files and how it handles squashed migrations. \n\nGiven the issue description, we are interested in:\n- The mechanism that generates the migration file names (`makemigrations` command).\n- How squashed migrations are recognized and handled by the system.\n- The logic that determines the next migration number.\n\nBased on this, the following API calls will be necessary to find the relevant parts of the code:\n\n1. **Search for the class responsible for handling migrations**: Since migrations are a core part of Django's functionality, there is likely a class responsible for handling migration file generation. I suspect it might be in the migrations module, possibly something like `MigrationAutodetector` or a similar utility. Hence, I will start by looking for a class that could be responsible for this process.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")\n```\n\n2. **Search method related to file naming or migration creation within the migrations module**: The issue specifically highlights a problem with naming conventions of migration files, so we need to find the method responsible for generating these file names.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"makemigrations\")\nsearch_method(\"generate_migration_name\")\n```\n\nGiven these initial search inputs, we aim to identify the specific parts of Django's code responsible for the behavior described in the issue. After locating these elements, a closer inspection of the involved logic will be necessary to devise a suitable patch for the issue."
