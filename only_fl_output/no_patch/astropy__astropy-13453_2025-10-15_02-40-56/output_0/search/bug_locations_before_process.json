This involves: - Parsing the `formats` dictionary argument to apply specified formatting to each column. - Ensuring that these formatting instructions are applied as the HTML table is generated, similar to how formatting is applied in CSV or rst outputs. - The implementation must maintain compatibility with other column specifications and settings, not overriding other functionalities. - This adjustment should occur without affecting the general structure or functionality of the output methods, preserving existing capabilities beyond formatting handling."
