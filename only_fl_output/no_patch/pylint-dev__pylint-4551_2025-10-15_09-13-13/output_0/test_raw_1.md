Given the feedback, let's approach the problem again with a more refined Python script. This time, the script will dynamically generate the Python code that demonstrates the issue, use `pylint`'s `pyreverse` module directly from within Python to generate the UML diagram (bypassing the FileNotFoundError issue related to not finding the `pyreverse` command), and then check if the output `.dot` files contain the expected type hint. I'll modify the reproducibility approach to avoid the FileNotFoundError by directly invoking the relevant functionality from within the Python ecosystem.

This updated `reproducer.py` script:

1. Dynamically generates a piece of Python code that demonstrates the issue.
2. Utilizes the `pylint.pyreverse.main` function directly if possible, or alternatively sets up an appropriate environment for pyreverse execution without relying on the command line directly.
3. Parses the generated `.dot` file to check for the presence of type hints in the UML.

```python
import os
import tempfile
from pylint.pyreverse.main import Run
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def generate_and_check_uml(code: str, expected: str):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
        module_file = temp_path / "temp_module.py"
        with module_file.open("w") as f:
            f.write(code)
        
        # Set output directory to temp_dir
        output_name = "output"
        try:
            Run([str(module_file), "-o", "png", "-p", output_name, "--output-directory", str(temp_path)])
            # Check in .dot files for expected string
            dot_files = list(temp_path.glob(f"{output_name}*.dot"))
            if not dot_files:
                raise AssertionError("No .dot files generated by pyreverse.")

            found = False
            for dot_file in dot_files:
                with dot_file.open("r") as f:
                    if expected in f.read():
                        found = True
                        break
            
            assert found, f"Expected '{expected}' not found in UML diagrams."
            print("Type hint correctly reflected in UML!")
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)

def main():
    class_code = """
class C(object):
    def __init__(self, a: str = None):
        self.a = a
"""
    expected_hint = "a : str"
    generate_and_check_uml(class_code, expected_hint)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Important considerations for this script:

- It dynamically creates the Python code sample and writes it to a temporary file.
- It directly utilizes pylint's pyreverse module to generate UML diagrams to the specified output directory.
- It searches the resulting `.dot` files for the expected type hint annotation.

Keep in mind:
- This script presumes the direct use of `pylint.pyreverse.main.Run` is possible as of my last knowledge update. However, actual access paths or methods may vary depending on `pylint`'s version; refer to the latest `pylint` documentation for accurate usage.
- Depending on your `pylint` installation and environment (e.g., virtualenv, conda), you may need to ensure that `pylint` and its dependencies are correctly installed and accessible to the script.
- This script should be adapted or extended to fit into the exact mechanisms or output formats (e.g., image files) you're working with for UML diagram analysis.
