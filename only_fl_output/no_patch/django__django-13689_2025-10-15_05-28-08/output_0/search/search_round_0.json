        "content": "To address the issue of the ExpressionWrapper's expression being omitted from the GROUP BY clause during the aggregation in Django models, we need to gather relevant code context related to the classes and methods handling queryset annotations, expressions, and aggregations. The reported problem indicates a potential issue in how Django constructs SQL queries for aggregation when using ExpressionWrapper with a Group By clause. Based on the description, the following API calls will be necessary to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. Search for the `ExpressionWrapper` class which is central to the reported issue.\n2. Search for the `annotate` method, as it is directly mentioned in the issue and is likely involved in how expressions are handled in the query.\n3. Search for the `Count` class method, since the issue involves the `Count` aggregation function.\n4. Search for code related to how the `GROUP BY` clause is constructed, particularly when involving conditions like `IS NULL`.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n- `search_class(\"Count\")`\n- `search_code(\"GROUP BY\")`"
