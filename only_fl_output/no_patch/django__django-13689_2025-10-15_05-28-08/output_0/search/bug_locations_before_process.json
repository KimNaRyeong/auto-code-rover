        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that any expression affecting the `GROUP BY` logic, especially ones that introduce conditions like `IS NULL`, are correctly reflected in the SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause. It might require enhancing the method to better handle or explicitly include expressions that don't directly map to a single database column but modify the grouping behavior (e.g., through conditions applied to the columns). The adjustment should allow `ExpressionWrapper` to maintain its generic utility while ensuring specific use cases like the one described are handled accurately. This change needs to preserve all other functionalities, particularly how `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with different expressions and fields, to ensure that it continues to work for all other use cases without causing regressions."
