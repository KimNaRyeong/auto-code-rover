Certainly, let's create an updated version of `reproducer.py` with the details provided. This script targets the specific issue of `HuberRegressor.fit` method raising a `TypeError` when passed an `X` matrix of boolean values. It incorporates the use of the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor

    # Generate synthetic data
    X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, random_state=0)
    X_bool = X > 0

    try:
        # Try fitting HuberRegressor with boolean X
        huber = HuberRegressor().fit(X_bool, y)
        print("No issue: HuberRegressor handled boolean X without error.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: TypeError encountered with boolean X.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)

    exit(0)
```

This script is designed to:

1. Generate a synthetic dataset using `make_regression` from Scikit-learn, with predictors (`X`) and targets (`y`).
2. Convert `X` to boolean values (true where `X` is greater than 0).
3. Attempt to fit a `HuberRegressor` model with `X_bool` as predictors.
4. If a `TypeError` occurs during fitting, the error's stack trace is printed using the `print_stacktrace` function, and an `AssertionError` is raised to indicate that the issue has been successfully replicated.
5. Exit with code 0 if no error occurs, indicating either the issue has been fixed or it could not be replicated under the test conditions.

This script ensures a clear reporting mechanism for replicating the error and validating the resolution of the issue in question.
