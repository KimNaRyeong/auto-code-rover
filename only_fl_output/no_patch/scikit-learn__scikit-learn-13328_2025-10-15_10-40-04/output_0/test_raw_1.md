This script is designed to automatically verify the functionality of the `HuberRegressor` when fitting a model with predictors (`X`) of `bool` dtype. If the `HuberRegressor` cannot efficiently handle boolean values as inputs without raising a `TypeError`, this test script will raise an `AssertionError`, signifying the presence of the issue.

The test starts by generating a regression dataset using `make_regression` from Scikit-learn. The predictors in the dataset are then converted to boolean values, simulating the conditions reported in the issue. The script attempts to fit a `HuberRegressor` using the boolean predictors. If any error occurs, it is caught, and its stack trace is printed using `print_stacktrace`. An assertion error is raised afterward to signal the test's failure, indicating the persistence of the problem with boolean predictors. Conversely, if no error occurs, the script exits gracefully with a success message, indicating that the issue has either been resolved or could not be reproduced under the provided conditions.
