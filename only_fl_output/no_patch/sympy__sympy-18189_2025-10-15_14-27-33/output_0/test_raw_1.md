Based on your request and to correct the misunderstanding in my previous response, I will provide a standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the issue reliably and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to output a stack trace in case of an assertion error. If the issue is identified (i.e., the outputs of the diophantine function with different orders of symbols in `syms` parameter differ despite `permute=True`), it will raise and catch an `AssertionError` then print a detailed traceback. 

The corrected understanding of your original request necessitates a script that successfully catches and reports the discrepancy without misleadingly reporting a successful execution when the assertion fails.

Here is the corrected `reproducer.py` script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_diophantine_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, diophantine

    m, n = symbols('m n')
    
    # First order of symbols
    results1 = diophantine(n**4 + m**4 - 2**4 - 3**4, syms=(m, n), permute=True)
    
    # Reverse order of symbols
    results2 = diophantine(n**4 + m**4 - 2**4 - 3**4, syms=(n, m), permute=True)
    
    # Check if both results are the same, raising an error if there's an issue
    try:
        assert results1 == results2, "Diophantine produces different results based on symbols order"
        print("Test passed: No issue found. Diophantine produces consistent results regardless of symbols order.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_diophantine_issue()
```
This script fulfills the original criteria by correctly identifying and reporting on the issue, depending on the results of the `diophantine` function calls. The use of the `try...except` block around the assertion ensures that when the assertion fails (indicating the presence of the described bug), the exception is caught, and a stack trace is printed, providing detailed insight into the error's context within the script.
