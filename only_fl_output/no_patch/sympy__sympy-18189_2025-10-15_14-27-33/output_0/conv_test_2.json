        "content": "Based on your request and to correct the misunderstanding in my previous response, I will provide a standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the issue reliably and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to output a stack trace in case of an assertion error. If the issue is identified (i.e., the outputs of the diophantine function with different orders of symbols in `syms` parameter differ despite `permute=True`), it will raise and catch an `AssertionError` then print a detailed traceback. \n\nThe corrected understanding of your original request necessitates a script that successfully catches and reports the discrepancy without misleadingly reporting a successful execution when the assertion fails.\n\nHere is the corrected `reproducer.py` script:\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_diophantine_issue():\n    from sympy import symbols, diophantine\n\n    m, n = symbols('m n')\n    \n    # First order of symbols\n    results1 = diophantine(n**4 + m**4 - 2**4 - 3**4, syms=(m, n), permute=True)\n    \n    # Reverse order of symbols\n    results2 = diophantine(n**4 + m**4 - 2**4 - 3**4, syms=(n, m), permute=True)\n    \n    # Check if both results are the same, raising an error if there's an issue\n    try:\n        assert results1 == results2, \"Diophantine produces different results based on symbols order\"\n        print(\"Test passed: No issue found. Diophantine produces consistent results regardless of symbols order.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_diophantine_issue()\n```\nThis script fulfills the original criteria by correctly identifying and reporting on the issue, depending on the results of the `diophantine` function calls. The use of the `try...except` block around the assertion ensures that when the assertion fails (indicating the presence of the described bug), the exception is caught, and a stack trace is printed, providing detailed insight into the error's context within the script."
