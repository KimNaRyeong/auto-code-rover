This script aims to reproduce the issue with `diophantine` providing different results depending on the order of symbols despite `permute=True` being set. It will assert that the two results are equal. If they are not, indicating that the issue is present, it will catch the `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. When the issue is fixed, the program will exit normally, printing a confirmation message and not producing any error output.
