        "intended_behavior": "The `as_relational` method needs to be modified to correctly handle `Range` objects with steps other than 1. This entails: - Preserving existing functionality for when the range is a simple continuous range (i.e., step equals 1) by keeping the current logical conditions intact. - Introducing an additional condition for ranges where the step is not 1. This condition should ensure that any `x` satisfying the range's relational expression must not only lie within the specified bounds (`inf` and `sup`) but also conform to the sequence defined by the range's step. Specifically for a range like `Range(3, 11, 2)`, the method should add an `Eq(Mod(x, step), Mod(start, step))` condition to the logical `And` construct. This condition ensures that `x` is one of the numbers in the step sequence starting from the first number of the range. By implementing this adjustment, `as_relational` will accurately return relational expressions for ranges with arbitrary steps, ensuring the expressions only evaluate to `True` for numbers that are actually contained within the range as defined not just by its bounds, but by its stepping pattern as well."
