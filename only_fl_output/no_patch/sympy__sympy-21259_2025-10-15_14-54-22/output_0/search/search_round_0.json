Search for the `Range` class in the codebase to understand its structure and identify the file it is located in:\n   - `search_class(\"Range\")`\n\n2. Search for the `as_relational` method within the `Range` class to directly find where the logic that needs to be updated is implemented:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"as_relational\", \"Range\")`\n\n3. Since the issue description references a specific way `Range(3,11,2).as_relational(x)` is incorrectly processed, let's also search for code snippets that might directly reference or implement this logic to get additional context on how it's currently being handled:\n   - `search_code(\"Range(3,11,2).as_relational(x)\")`\n\nThese calls will help identify the relevant parts of the codebase where changes are necessary to address the issue."
