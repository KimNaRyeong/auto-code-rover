Considering the feedback, here is an adjustment to the `reproducer.py` script to ensure it better aligns with the nature of the reported issue. This version attempts to reproduce the issue as described, specifically focusing on the ValueError related to dataset length calculation after using `assign_coords` with a multi-index scenario in an `xarray.Dataset`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_dataset_behavior():
    ds = xr.DataArray(
        [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
        dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
        coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
        name="test",
    ).to_dataset()

    stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
    stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
        {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
    )

    assert len(stacked['time']) >= 0, "Length of 'time' coordinate should not be negative"
    assert 'time' in stacked.coords, "'time' should be in dataset coordinates"
    assert set(stacked.dims) == set(['lat', 'time']), "Dataset dimensions mismatch"
    
    return stacked

def main():
    try:
        test_dataset_behavior()
        print("No issue detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script focuses on key points:
- Creation of an `xarray.Dataset` from a `DataArray` with specific dimensions and coordinates.
- Stacking of the dataset along specified dimensions.
- Assignment of new coordinates to the stacked dataset, aiming to trigger the issue.
- Assertions to test if the length of a coordinate is non-negative and presents as expected in dimensions and coordinates after the operation. 

If the issue reproduces, it is expected that either an assertion will fail, or a `ValueError` will be raised when the length of `stacked['time']` is checked, indicative of the reported problem.

The script exits normally if the checks pass, which would suggest that the issue either doesn't reproduce in the current environment or has been resolved. It prints a detailed stack trace of any caught exception otherwise, providing insight into the failure point.
