To address the instructions and ensure a practical demonstration of the issue regarding `assign_coords` with a multi-index in `xarray`, I've crafted a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script directly targets the issue as described, attempting to manipulate multi-indexes and coordinates within an `xarray` dataset. It's designed to confront the specific problem spotted, which involves the dataset entering a broken state upon using `assign_coords` after a `.stack()` operation. The script includes the special function to print the stack trace for clear diagnostics if an error arises.

Please find below the standalone Python script.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
            {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
        )
        
        # Perform an operation that would fail if the issue is present.
        len_result = len(stacked)
        if len_result < 0:
            raise AssertionError("Dataset length is negative, indicating a broken state after using assign_coords with a multi-index.")

        # No issue encountered - indicate successful execution
        print("The script executed successfully. No issue detected.")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        raise ae
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to:
- Construct an `xarray.Dataset` from a `DataArray` with predefined dimensions and coordinates.
- Apply `.stack()` followed by `assign_coords()` to replicate the scenario reported as problematic.
- Verify if the dataset length is non-negative post manipulation, asserting the expected behavior.
- Utilize `print_stacktrace()` if an exception arises, providing detailed debugging information.

Execution of this script (`python3 reproducer.py`) in the project's root directory should demonstrate the problem if present, by asserting a negative length condition that shouldn't normally occur. The script exits with code 0 upon success (indicating the absence of the discussed issue) or reports a detailed error, adhering to the prescribed debugging format.
