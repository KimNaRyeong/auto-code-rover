After assigning the coordinates, the dataset was in a state where its length was coming out as less than zero, which caused all sorts of issues.\n### What did you expect to happen?\nI think the issue is with the updating of `_coord_names`, perhaps in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/18454c218002e48e1643ce8e25654262e5f592ad/xarray/core/coordinates.py#L389.\nI expected to just be able to assign the coords and then print the array to see the result.\n### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example\n```Python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### MVCE confirmation\n- [X] Minimal example \u2014 the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.\n- [X] Complete example \u2014 the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.\n- [x] Verifiable example \u2014 the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt or [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/blank_template.ipynb), returning the result.\n- [X] New issue \u2014 a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.\n### Relevant log output\n```Python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"mre.py\", line 17, in <module>\nlen(stacked)\nFile \".../xarray-tests/xarray/core/dataset.py\", line 1364, in __len__\nreturn len(self.data_vars)\nValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\n```\n### Anything else we need to know?\nHere's a test (I put it in `test_dataarray.py` but maybe there is a better spot)\n```python\ndef test_assign_coords_drop_coord_names(self) -> None:\nds = DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# this seems to be handled correctly\nassert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {\"test\", \"time\", \"lat\"}\n# however, _coord_names doesn't seem to update as expected\n# the below fails\nassert set(stacked._coord_names) == {\"time\", \"lat\"}\n# the incorrect value of _coord_names means that all the below fails too\n# The failure is because the length of a dataset is calculated as (via len(data_vars))\n# len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names). For the situation\n# above, where len(dataset._coord_names) is greater than len(dataset._variables),\n# you get a length less than zero which then fails because length must return\n# a value greater than zero\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### Environment\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: e678a1d7884a3c24dba22d41b2eef5d7fe5258e7\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:14)\n[Clang 12.0.1 ]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 21.5.0\nmachine: arm64\nprocessor: arm\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_AU.UTF-8\nLOCALE: ('en_AU', 'UTF-8')\nlibhdf5: 1.12.2\nlibnetcdf: 4.8.1\nxarray: 0.1.dev4312+ge678a1d.d20220928\npandas: 1.5.0\nnumpy: 1.22.4\nscipy: 1.9.1\nnetCDF4: 1.6.1\npydap: installed\nh5netcdf: 1.0.2\nh5py: 3.7.0\nNio: None\nzarr: 2.13.2\ncftime: 1.6.2\nnc_time_axis: 1.4.1\nPseudoNetCDF: 3.2.2\nrasterio: 1.3.1\ncfgrib: 0.9.10.1\niris: 3.3.0\nbottleneck: 1.3.5\ndask: 2022.9.1\ndistributed: 2022.9.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.0\ncartopy: 0.21.0\nseaborn: 0.12.0\nnumbagg: 0.2.1\nfsspec: 2022.8.2\ncupy: None\npint: 0.19.2\nsparse: 0.13.0\nflox: 0.5.9\nnumpy_groupies: 0.9.19\nsetuptools: 65.4.0\npip: 22.2.2\nconda: None\npytest: 7.1.3\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the results obtained from the API calls, let's analyze the collected context. \n\n### Analysis of `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords`\n\nThe first chunk of code from `xarray/core/coordinates.py` defines the `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords` method within the `DataArrayCoordinates` class. This method is responsible for dropping variables in the provided `coords` set, along with any associated variables. This functionality is relevant to the bug report because it manipulates coordinate data, which could impact the dataset's integrity and metadata, such as `_coord_names`. However, the issue's description is more about assigning new coordinates rather than dropping them, so the direct impact might be a step or two removed from this method. The actual bug seems to concern how assigning coordinates interacts with `_coord_names` and potentially the dataset's indexes (`_indexes`), which might not be directly addressed by this snippet.\n\n### Understanding `assign_coords`\n\nRegarding the `assign_coords` method, it appears in both `xarray/core/groupby.py` and `xarray/core/common.py`. Since the user's issue pertains to `assign_coords` usage on a dataset (implying potential alterations in the dataset's structure or metadata), we can infer that the relevant logic within `assign_coords` probably interacts with or relies on the assumptions made by `DataArrayCoordinates` and dataset handling mechanisms. This indicates that a deeper dive into how `assign_coords` updates the dataset's coordinates and possibly its `_coord_names` and `_indexes` would be necessary to identify the bug. It suggests that the assignment operation might either not update `_coord_names` appropriately or does so in a way that leads to a state inconsistency, such as a discrepancy between the actual coordinates and those recorded in `_coord_names`.\n\n### Investigating `__len__`\n\nThe `__len__` method implementations in `xarray/core/dataset.py` reveal how the length of a dataset is calculated, which is central to the issue reported. Specifically, one version of `__len__` returns the number of `data_vars`, which is straightforward but doesn't account for `_coord_names`. Another version computes the length as the difference between the dataset's variables (`_variables`) and coordinate names (`_coord_names`). This calculation ties directly into the issue since an incorrect length calculation would occur if `_coord_names` does not accurately reflect the state of the dataset after operations like `assign_coords`. \n\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior would ensure that `_coord_names` correctly and consistently reflects the dataset's coordinates, especially after such operations, to prevent negative lengths and related errors. It seems probable that after assigning new coordinates, either the dataset's `_coord_names` is not updated appropriately to match its current state, or the logic that depends on `_coord_names` (such as `__len__`) doesn't handle this scenario well.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nFrom this analysis, the relationship between the buggy behavior and the parts of the code reviewed suggests that the underlying issue might involve a failure to correctly update and synchronize `_coord_names` (and possibly `_indexes`) with the actual state of the dataset after using `assign_coords`. To better diagnose and ultimately resolve the bug, further exploration into how `assign_coords` is implemented in `xarray/core/common.py` would be essential, especially focusing on how it manipulates `_coord_names` and datasets' internal structures. Additional context around the `assign_coords` method's implementation and its interaction with dataset metadata would be crucial next steps."

This involves not just the assignment but also a validation or correction step ensuring that `_coord_names` is synchronized with the actual coordinates. This synchronization step must preserve the existing functionality, meaning it should not disrupt how coordinates are assigned but rather ensure the metadata matches the state of the dataset after this operation is performed.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n  - **Class**: Likely `Dataset`, given the context of the issue.\n  - **Method**: Potentially within `__len__` or a method that affects the dataset's length indirectly by manipulating `_coord_names` or the dataset\u2019s internals that determine size.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: It should correctly compute the dataset's length in all scenarios, including after coordinate assignment operations. This might involve adjusting the logic to better handle instances where `_coord_names` and the actual coordinates are out of sync, or improving how `_coord_names` is updated in conjunction with coordinate assignments. The correct behavior must ensure that the length of the dataset never becomes negative, reflecting the accurate count of data variables or coordinate dimensions, respecting the integrity of multiindex coordinates or any special scenarios introduced through methods like `assign_coords`."
