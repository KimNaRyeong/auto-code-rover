Given the specifications and the requirement for an executable file that raises an `AssertionError` when a specific issue is present, and exits with code 0 when the issue is resolved, below is the revised content for `reproducer.py`. This Python script aims to check for the described issue with `pairwise_distances` function from scikit-learn, focusing on the `cosine` metric problem when executed in parallel, and the related problem with the `euclidean` metric yielding integers instead of floats under certain conditions.

Please copy the following script into a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pairwise_distances():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])

    metrics = ['cosine', 'euclidean']
    n_jobs_list = [-1, 1, 2]

    issues_detected = False

    for metric in metrics:
        for n_jobs in n_jobs_list:
            try:
                results = pairwise_distances(X, metric=metric, n_jobs=n_jobs)
                if metric == 'cosine':
                    assert not np.allclose(results, np.zeros_like(results)), "Cosine results are all zeros."
                elif metric == 'euclidean' and n_jobs != 1:
                    assert results.dtype == float, "Euclidean results are not floats."
                
                print(f"Testing metric={metric}, n_jobs={n_jobs}: Passed")
            except AssertionError as e:
                print(f"Issue detected with metric={metric}, n_jobs={n_jobs}")
                print_stacktrace(e)
                issues_detected = True
    
    if not issues_detected:
        print("No issues detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        return 0
    else:
        return 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit(test_pairwise_distances())
```

This script incorporates the function to print the stack trace for any assertion errors encountered during execution. It tests for the issue with both the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics under different `n_jobs` settings as described. If the expected results are not met (namely, getting all zeros for `cosine` or getting integer results for `euclidean` when `n_jobs` is not set to 1), it will print a detailed stack trace for each failure detected.
