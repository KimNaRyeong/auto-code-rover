        "intended_behavior": "To fix the issue, the `pairwise_distances` function must ensure accurate results are returned regardless of the `n_jobs` parameter's value, especially for the 'cosine' and 'euclidean' metrics. The intended behavior within a parallel execution context (`n_jobs=-1` or greater than 2) should seamlessly match the accuracy of serial execution (`n_jobs=1`). This involves ensuring correct data segmentation for parallel processing and correct aggregation of results from parallel tasks. For the 'euclidean' metric, care must be taken to return floating-point distances rather than integers, indicating a potential casting issue when collecting results from parallel computations. For the 'cosine' metric, it is essential to validate the computation logic applied in parallel processing to prevent the return of zero matrices. Debugging should particularly focus on ensuring that no datatype conversions lead to loss of precision or incorrect zeroing of results. Validation of input data types and ensuring consistency across different execution paths is critical. Additionally, verifying the integration with underlying numerical libraries (like numpy, scipy) when computing these distances in parallel could be necessary to address any external causes of the issue.\n\nThe resolution requires a thorough review and potentially adjusting the parallel computation code path to maintain consistent behavior with the serial execution path. The validation tests should cover various scenarios of `n_jobs`, including border cases and extreme values, to ensure that parallel execution does not alter the computation's correctness."
