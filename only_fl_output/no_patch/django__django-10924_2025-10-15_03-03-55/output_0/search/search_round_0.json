Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\nname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to allowing `FilePathField`'s `path` argument to accept a callable, especially in a Django model, we need to understand how `FilePathField` is implemented and how it currently handles the `path` argument. We also need to check if there's an existing mechanism that allows for dynamic resolution of paths in Django models or fields.\n\nHere are the API calls that would help to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FilePathField\")` - This will provide us with an overview or specific file locations of where `FilePathField` is implemented in Django's codebase. Understanding its current implementation will be crucial to making modifications that allow `path` to be callable.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"FilePathField\")` - Since the issue involves creating migrations that correctly reference paths, understanding how `FilePathField` is deconstructed for migrations is important. The `deconstruct` method is used by Django to create migration files, and seeing how it handles the `path` attribute will be imperative.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"FilePathField\")` - Reviewing the constructor of `FilePathField` will provide insights into how the `path` argument is currently processed and stored within the field. This can highlight where modifications are needed to support a callable.\n\n4. `search_code(\"os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR\")` - Since the provided issue mentions using `os.path.join` in conjunction with Django settings to dynamically construct file paths, searching for similar usage patterns in the codebase might reveal existing solutions or implementations that handle variable file paths in models.\n\nThese API calls are targeted to find relevant code implementation details and existing patterns that could assist in solving the issue of making `FilePathField`'s `path` dynamically adaptable using callables."
