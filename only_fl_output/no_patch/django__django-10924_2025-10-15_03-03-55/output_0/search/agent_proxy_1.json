If it is, the callable should be invoked to resolve the path when necessary, primarily at runtime rather than during the field's initialization. This change must preserve the field's existing functionality for static paths, meaning it should continue to accept static strings as it does currently. To implement this, an additional check can be introduced to determine the nature of the `path` argument (callable vs. static string), and the result of calling the path, if it is a callable, should be handled appropriately within the method. This will ensure that the field's behavior dynamically adapts to the runtime environment.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:  \n  **File**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`  \n  **Class**: `FilePathField`  \n  **Method**: `deconstruct`  \n  **Intended Behavior**: The `deconstruct` method needs to be capable of handling the case where `path` is a callable. Given Django's migration framework does not execute Python code during migration operations, the solution may involve storing a reference to the callable (e.g., the fully qualified name of the function) rather than its runtime result. The migration system should then be made aware that if the `path` argument is a callable, it needs to be invoked appropriately whenever the field is reconstructed from migrations. This approach will require careful consideration on how to serialize and deserialize the callable reference in a way that is consistent with Django's migration framework expectations and security considerations.\n\nBoth modifications aim to extend `FilePathField`'s functionality to handle callables for dynamic path resolution while ensuring backward compatibility and adherence to Django's design principles, particularly in terms of migrations and model field definitions."
