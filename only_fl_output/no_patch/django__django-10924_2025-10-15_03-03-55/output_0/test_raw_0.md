This script assumes a Django environment and dynamically creates models and migration commands to simulate the scenario described in the issue. Note that without a direct check of the migration file content or specific handling of Django's internal migration generation logic, this script provides a simplified approach to demonstrating the issue. For a fully accurate verification, one would need to inspect the generated migration file to see if the dynamic path resolution is correctly handled or not.
