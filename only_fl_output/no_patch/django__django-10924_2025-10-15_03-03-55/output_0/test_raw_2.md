Given the necessity to accurately reproduce the issue while correctly initializing Django's environment and app registry, here's an adjusted standalone script that should capture the specified behavior more reliably.

This script will attempt to define a Django model with a `FilePathField` where the path argument is intended to be a callable, aiming to replicate the core of the described problem. If Django's `FilePathField` cannot handle a callable as its `path` argument, we should encounter problems either during model definition or when attempting to execute a migration operation.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys

def setup_django_env():
    from django.conf import settings
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        SECRET_KEY='fake-key',
        BASE_DIR=os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
    )

    import django
    django.setup()

# Define custom print stacktrace function as instructed
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Callable for FilePathField 'path' argument
def dynamic_path():
    from django.conf import settings
    return os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'example_dir')

def reproduce_issue():
    # Setup Django environment
    setup_django_env()

    from django.db import models

    # Define a model class dynamically to test FilePathField with callable path
    class TestModel(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        file = models.FilePathField(path=dynamic_path)

        class Meta:
            app_label = '__main__'

    # Attempt to create and apply migrations, should fail if issue is present
    try:
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False, name='test_migration_callable_path')
        call_command('migrate', '__main__')

        # If no exceptions were raised, assume FilePathField can accept callable without issues
        print("Test passed: `FilePathField` accepts a callable without errors.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed: Django `FilePathField` does not accept callable for dynamic path resolution.") from e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script does the following:
- Dynamically configures a minimal Django environment enough to test the behavior.
- Defines a `TestModel` class with a `FilePathField` where its `path` argument is a callable, aiming to represent the issue scenario.
- Attempts to generate and apply migrations through Django's management commands to trigger any potential issues with handling a callable path in `FilePathField`.
- Utilizes the prescribed `print_stacktrace` function to output any errors encountered, following a traceback for easier analysis.

Be mindful to adapt paths or other specifics as needed to fit your environment or specific configurations. Also, ensure Django is installed in your Python environment before running the script.
