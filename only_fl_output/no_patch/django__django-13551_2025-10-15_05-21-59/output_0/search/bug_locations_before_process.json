        "intended_behavior": "The `_make_hash_value` method should be updated to include the user's current email address when generating the hash value. This ensures that if a user's email address changes, any previously generated password reset tokens will be invalidated, as the hash value upon which these tokens are based will no longer match. This modification directly addresses the issue of password reset tokens remaining valid even after the associated email address has been changed. The inclusion of the email in the hash calculation must be done in a manner that continues to respect the existing functionality for token generation and checking; namely, it should still incorporate the user's primary key, the password, and the last login timestamp in addition to the new email attribute. The inclusion should preserve backward compatibility as much as possible, ensuring that tokens already out there might remain valid until other criteria (password change, last login update, or timeout) invalidate them, except in cases where the email has been changed, adding a necessary layer of security."
