        "content": "To address the issue described, we should gather context around the components mentioned, specifically any code related to password reset token generation and handling, as well as user email management. Key elements from the issue are `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` and the `_make_hash_value()` method inside it, possibly finding how and where user's email addresses are used within this process. Additionally, understanding how email changes are handled in relation to user authentication tokens could be crucial. Given this, here are the specific API calls I would perform:\n\n1. `search_class(\"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: To find the class definition or file where `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"_make_hash_value\")`: To locate the `_make_hash_value` method, which is crucial for token generation, and to understand its current logic.\n3. `search_method(\"change_email\")`: Assuming there might be a method to handle changing of email addresses, it could help us understand where and how the user's email is updated.\n4. `search_code(\"email change\")`: This will help to identify any snippets where email change events are handled, even if the method name does not explicitly include \"change\" or \"email.\""
