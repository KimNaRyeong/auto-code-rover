        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding not RFC 6265 compliant cookies in `contrib.messages` in Django, I would need to search for the specific part of the Django code that handles the setting or serializing of cookies within the messages framework. Since the issue relates to escape characters in cookie values, likely candidates for investigation are methods that serialize or otherwise prepare messages to be stored in cookies.\n\nHere are the relevant API calls to perform:\n\n1. Search for the `contrib.messages` class to understand its structure:\n   - `search_class(\"MessageStorage\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the handling of cookie values, specifically the serialization or setting of these values, we need to find methods related to cookie handling in the messages framework. Methods like `get`, `set`, or similar operations related to cookies are of interest:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"BaseStorage\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set\", \"BaseStorage\")`\n\n3. The issue describes a problem with an escape-character in cookie values, indicating that the problem might occur during the encoding or setting of these values. To get more context on how cookies are being serialized or encoded, we need to search for the related serialization logic:\n   - `search_method(\"encode\")`\n   - `search_method(\"serialize\")`\n\nEach of these steps is aimed at pinpointing where the RFC 6265 compliance issue might arise, focusing on how the `contrib.messages` framework handles cookies' values in Django."
