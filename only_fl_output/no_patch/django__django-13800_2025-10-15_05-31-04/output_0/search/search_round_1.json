Search for the `contrib.messages` class to understand its structure:\n   - `search_class(\"MessageStorage\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the handling of cookie values, specifically the serialization or setting of these values, we need to find methods related to cookie handling in the messages framework. Methods like `get`, `set`, or similar operations related to cookies are of interest:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"BaseStorage\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set\", \"BaseStorage\")`\n\n3. The issue describes a problem with an escape-character in cookie values, indicating that the problem might occur during the encoding or setting of these values. To get more context on how cookies are being serialized or encoded, we need to search for the related serialization logic:\n   - `search_method(\"encode\")`\n   - `search_method(\"serialize\")`\n\nEach of these steps is aimed at pinpointing where the RFC 6265 compliance issue might arise, focusing on how the `contrib.messages` framework handles cookies' values in Django."

        "content": "Given the results of our API calls and the unsuccessful attempts to locate specific classes and methods directly related to `MessageStorage` or cookie handling in `BaseStorage`, we need to adjust our strategy. The findings indicate that the search for `MessageStorage` did not yield results, and the more general attempts to find `get` and `set` methods within `BaseStorage` were also unfruitful. This suggests that the entity names might not be exactly as stated, or that we need to direct our investigation towards other components that are involved in cookie handling within Django's messaging or session infrastructure.\n\nFrom the successful searches:\n- The `encode` method's occurrences across various parts of Django, including sessions and authentication hashers, point towards general utility methods for encoding data. These could be relevant because the issue involves the improper handling of escape characters in cookie values, which could occur during encoding processes.\n- The `serialize` method's presence in parts of the framework dealing with HTTP responses, database migrations, and serialization logic could indirectly contribute to understanding how Django converts complex data types into formats suitable for storage or transmission, including into cookies.\n\n**Next steps based on analysis:**\n\n1. **Explore Cookie Handling in Sessions and Messages:**\n   Since the initial class and method lookups were not successful, and given the issue relates to cookies, it makes sense to investigate the serialization and encoding of session data, as sessions frequently utilize cookies. The `django/contrib/sessions/base_session.py` and `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py` files containing the `encode` methods could provide insights into how data destined for cookies is processed.\n\n2. **Understand General Encoding Practices in Django:**\n   The presence of `encode` methods in areas related to request handling and particularly in session management (`django/http/request.py`, `django/contrib/sessions/base_session.py`, and `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`) suggests these areas might include relevant logic for cookie value handling. Understanding this could shed light on the specific encoding issues mentioned in the bug report.\n\n3. **Investigation into Direct Cookie Manipulation:**\n   Although cookies are managed broadly within Django\u2019s request and response framework, the cookies themselves might be set or manipulated in more specific locations, possibly including middleware or within the messaging framework itself, albeit under different class or method names than initially assumed.\n\n**Refined API Calls:**\n- Given the likely relevance of sessions to the issue, diving deeper into `django/contrib/sessions` and `django/http` components might be helpful. Specifically, looking at methods within files related to session management that might set or serialize cookie values could be the next step.\n- Investigate how cookies are set or modified within the messaging framework by searching directly for methods or classes involved in cookie manipulation or message storage:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"set_cookie\", \"django/http/response.py\")`\n  - `search_code(\"messages\")` to find references to message setting or handling that might involve cookies.\n  \nThese approaches aim to directly connect the issue's description with specific implementation details within Django's codebase, especially focusing on components that interact with cookies, sessions, and messages."

However, I can hypothesize likely components that should be investigated based on how Django typically handles messaging and cookies:\n\n- **File:** Likely in one of the session-related files (`django/contrib/sessions/base_session.py` or `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`) or possibly within the messaging system's implementation that has not been directly identified through the provided search results.\n\n- **Class/Method:** Within these files, the issue likely resides in methods responsible for encoding or serializing session data into cookies. This could manifest in methods specifically designed to serialize session data (`encode` or similar) and methods that set cookie values (`set_cookie` or logic that directly manipulates cookie headers).\n\n**Intended Behavior to Resolve the Issue:**\n\nTo adhere to RFC 6265 concerning cookie handling:\n- The encoding or serialization logic should be reviewed and updated to ensure that characters not allowed or advised against by RFC 6265 are correctly handled. This might involve implementing additional escape mechanisms or validation checks to ensure compliance with the standard.\n- For methods that insert values into cookies (setting messages into cookies, for instance), the intended behavior should include a review or amendment to ensure that special characters are correctly escaped without introducing characters or escape sequences disallowed by RFC 6265.\n- Ensure any serialization or encoding methods that contribute to cookie generation adhere strictly to RFC 6265 standards, potentially adding new utility functions or methods to handle specific edge cases related to disallowed characters or sequences.\n\nWithout direct references to specific classes or methods within the Django project that handle these particular operations within the `contrib.messages` framework or session cookie handling, providing detailed bug locations and fixes is speculative. A deeper dive into Django's session and messaging code, especially areas related to cookie handling, is required for precise locations and fixes."
