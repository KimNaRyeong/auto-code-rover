        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `parse_http_date` method in `django/utils/http.py`, we address the three questions to understand the issue and guide our next steps.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\nThe `parse_http_date` function is designed to parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1. It accepts three different date formats, presumably RFC1123, RFC850, and ASCTIME, as indicated by the variables used in the loop. When the year parsed from the date string is less than 100, it applies logic to determine the full year, assuming years below 70 belong to the 2000s and years 70 and above to the 1900s. This interpretation handles the two-digit year representation.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe issue description mentions that the current logic for handling two-digit years is incorrect according to RFC 7231 (and RFC 2822 by extension), which requires that a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. The current implementation in `parse_http_date`, specifically lines 178-182, uses a static rule without comparing against the current year, leading to potential misinterpretation of dates near the 50-year boundary.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior would dynamically calculate the cutoff for deciding whether a two-digit year belongs to the 20th or 21st century based on the current year. Instead of a static boundary of \"70\", the code should determine if a two-digit year interpreted as being in the future is more than 50 years ahead of the current year and, if so, treat it as a past year.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps involve adjusting the current static boundary logic to:\n- Dynamically calculate the current year and determine the cutoff based on a rolling 50-year window.\n- Appropriately adjust years that fall within this window to ensure compliance with the RFC guidelines.\n\nIt appears that the initial search queries for hardcoded logic strings did not yield results because those specific terms might not be used in the comments or code. To move forward, we need more context or relevant utility methods that deal with date computation, specifically those that might help in comparing the current year with the parsed year. We can look into the usage of methods or variables that obtain the current date within the same file or relevant utility functions.\n\nThus, the next step could involve:\n- Investigating how the current year is obtained or used within `django/utils/http.py` or similar utility methods that might be applied to adjust the logic based on the current date. \n\nSince direct searches for hardcoded logic did not yield results, enhancing our understanding of date-related operations within this context seems like the most viable next step."

This change aims to align with RFC 7231's guidance which states that a two-digit year \"that appears to be more than 50 years in the future\" should be interpreted as \"representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\"\n   \n   Specifically, the code within the method that currently reads:\n   ```python\n   if year < 100:\n       if year < 70:\n           year += 2000\n       else:\n           year += 1900\n   ```\n   should be replaced or supplemented with a dynamic calculation. This calculation must take into consideration the current year and interpret two-digit years in such a way that if they are \"more than 50 years in the future,\" they are adjusted to the \"most recent year in the past\" as per the mentioned RFCs. \n   \n   A simplified approach might involve:\n   - Calculating the current year (e.g., using `datetime.datetime.now().year`).\n   - Establishing a threshold year based on the current year minus 50 years for the past and adding 50 years for the future threshold.\n   - Adjusting the two-digit year to fall within the derived threshold, ensuring it is treated correctly as either 20th or 21st century.\n   \n   This approach ensures the function's date parsing remains compliant with modern standards and can dynamically adapt as time progresses, without needing further adjustments as we move further into the 21st century."
