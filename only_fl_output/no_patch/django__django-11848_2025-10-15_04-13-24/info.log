This change aims to align with RFC 7231's guidance which states that a two-digit year \"that appears to be more than 50 years in the future\" should be interpreted as \"representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\" Specifically, the code within the method that currently reads: `if year < 100: if year < 70: year += 2000 else: year += 1900` should be replaced or supplemented with a dynamic calculation. This calculation must take into consideration the current year and interpret two-digit years in such a way that if they are \"more than 50 years in the future,\" they are adjusted to the \"most recent year in the past\" as per the mentioned RFCs. A simplified approach might involve: - Calculating the current year (e.g., using `datetime.datetime.now().year`). - Establishing a threshold year based on the current year minus 50 years for the past and adding 50 years for the future threshold. - Adjusting the two-digit year to fall within the derived threshold, ensuring it is treated correctly as either 20th or 21st century. This approach ensures the function's date parsing remains compliant with modern standards and can dynamically adapt as time progresses, without needing further adjustments as we move further into the 21st century."
