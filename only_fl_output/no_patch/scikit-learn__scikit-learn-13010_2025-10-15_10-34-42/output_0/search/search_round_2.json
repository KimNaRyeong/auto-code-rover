I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **StandardScaler Implementation:**\n    - The `StandardScaler` class is found in `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py`. It contains methods for initializing the scaler, fitting data to compute the mean and standard deviation (`fit`), as well as transforming and inverting transformations on the data. The `fit` method is of particular interest because it computes the mean and standard deviation which are central to the issue at hand.\n\n2. **fit Method:**\n    - The `fit` method in `StandardScaler` is designed to compute the mean and standard deviation for later scaling. It accepts data `X` and an ignored `y`, indicating it's primarily concerned with features in `X`. This method resets internal state before calling `partial_fit` method, which implies the actual computation might be happening in `partial_fit`.\n\n3. **Relationship With the Bug:**\n    - The overflow error occurs when the `fit` method attempts to calculate the mean and standard deviation on a large `float16` numpy array. Based on the issue description and the role of the `fit` method, the overflow likely occurs during computations done in the `partial_fit` method, which means looking into `partial_fit` may provide insight into how these calculations are performed and how to prevent overflows.\n\n4. **Intended Behavior:**\n    - Ideally, the `StandardScaler` should be able to calculate mean and standard deviation without causing an overflow, regardless of the numpy array's dtype, especially for large datasets where memory efficiency (like using `float16`) is crucial. The intended behavior would involve safely computing these statistics possibly by using a data type that can handle the range of values without overflowing.\n\nGiven these reflections, the next steps would involve:\n- Investigating `partial_fit` in `StandardScaler` for details on how mean and std are computed.\n- Since the direct numpy mean and std class methods were not found, we should consider looking at how numpy's mean and std functions are used within the context of `StandardScaler`, potentially using a general search or examining their usage in `partial_fit`.\n- Understanding how numpy handles data type operations and how these operations might be adjusted within `StandardScaler` to prevent overflow with `float16` data types.\n\nTo continue with the analysis, we should invoke the following API calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"StandardScaler\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.mean\")` and `search_code(\"np.std\")` could also be helpful to understand the usage of numpy's mean and std functions in the context of the scaler, since direct class method searches for numpy were unsuccessful."

The method processes all of `X` as a single batch and uses `check_array` to ensure `X` is a valid input, handles possible sparse data, and then goes on to compute or update mean and variance depending on whether it's the first call or not. Notably, it uses `incr_mean_variance_axis` for incremental mean and variance computation on sparse matrices, and `_incremental_mean_and_var` for dense arrays, both of which are presumably designed to avoid numerical stability issues.\n\n2. **Relationship With the Bug**:\n   - The overflow issue likely occurs because the dtype of intermediate computations during mean and variance calculations is not adapted to prevent overflow for inputs with `float16` dtype. The method detailed shows computations that, if not specifically accounted for the precision limits of `float16`, could easily lead to overflows when summing large numbers of elements or computing variances. \n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - To avoid the overflow issue while preserving functionality, the code responsible for computing the mean and variance should:\n     - Ensure that intermediate computations, such as the sum of elements and calculation of variance, use a dtype with higher precision than `float16` when `X`'s dtype is `float16`. This might involve casting `X` to a higher precision dtype before these operations and then casting the result back if necessary.\n     - Maintain numerical stability and efficiency, only changing the dtype when necessary (i.e., when operating on `float16` data).\n     - Ideally, perform this precision management transparently to the user, without requiring manual intervention or conversion before using `StandardScaler`.\n\n### Further Context Needed:\n\nGiven the analysis, specific implementation details on how `incr_mean_variance_axis` and `_incremental_mean_and_var` handle dtype could offer further insights, especially regarding their handling of different data types and whether they already implement any form of dtype adjustment to prevent overflow or loss of precision. Additionally, understanding `check_array`, specifically its `dtype=FLOAT_DTYPES` parameter, could provide clues on dtype handling within `StandardScaler`.\n\n- It would be useful to look into the implementations of `incr_mean_variance_axis` and `_incremental_mean_and_var` to see how they compute mean and variance.\n- Examining how `check_array` deals with `dtype=FLOAT_DTYPES` could reveal if there's already a mechanism in place for adjusting dtype based on input or if such a mechanism needs to be augmented to account for `float16` specifics."

After these computations, the method can cast the result back to `float16` if necessary for output consistency but store internal state in higher precision to maintain numerical stability across incremental fits. This adjustment should be applied selectively, only when the input dtype is `float16`, to minimize unnecessary computational overhead for other dtypes.\n    - **Specific Implementation Note:** Check for the dtype of `X` early in the method. If `X.dtype` is `float16`, cast `X` to `float32` before any operations that could lead to overflow. This includes operations done directly in `partial_fit` and within calls to `incr_mean_variance_axis` and `_incremental_mean_and_var`. The internal state (`self.mean_`, `self.var_`, `self.scale_`) should preferably be stored in `float32` to preserve precision across multiple `partial_fit` calls without sacrificing the memory efficiency gained from using `float16` for the input data.\n\nThis solution aims to strike a balance between preserving memory efficiency when using `float16` arrays and ensuring numerical stability and accuracy in the computation of means and scales by `StandardScaler`."
