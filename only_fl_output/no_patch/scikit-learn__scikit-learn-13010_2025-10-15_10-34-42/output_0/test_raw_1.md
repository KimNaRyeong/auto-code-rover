This script specifically checks for the issue where using `StandardScaler` on a large `float16` array results in an overflow, causing NaNs to appear in the output. In the event that the error is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace showing where the error occurred. If a different unexpected error arises, it will also print a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the issue. 

Please run this as a standalone file in the project's root directory by executing `python3 reproducer.py`. This will aid in clearly identifying whether the issue persists or if it has been resolved, as intended by the script's design.
