        "intended_behavior": "The `prepare_body` method in the `PreparedRequest` class should ensure that when preparing multipart form data, all field names are encoded as UTF-8 strings correctly without the Python byte string literal `b''` prefix appearing in the encoded form. This means handling the encoding of multipart form data field names in a way that preserves their intended representation as UTF-8 strings when constructing the request body. Specifically, this method should:\n- Check if field names are instances of `str` and encode them to byte strings using UTF-8 encoding _without_ leaving any Python-specific byte string literals in the final request body.\n- Ensure that the encoding process is seamlessly integrated into the existing multipart form data construction process, maintaining compatibility with all other forms of data handled by the method.\n- This adjustment should not affect the existing functionality of handling non-Unicode data or other parts of the request preparation process.\n\nThis solution aims to address the issue seen in the `test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames()` where the encoded name includes unwanted Python-specific notations, ensuring that multipart form data is correctly formatted according to the specifications and expectations of web servers and APIs that process such requests."
