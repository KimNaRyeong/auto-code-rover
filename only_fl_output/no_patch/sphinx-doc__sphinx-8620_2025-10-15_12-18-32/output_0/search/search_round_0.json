If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue properly, we need to understand how the `:kbd:` role is processed and transformed into HTML within the Sphinx codebase. Given the details in the issue, the focus should be on how Sphinx generates the `<kbd>` HTML elements, including how classes are assigned to these elements.\n\nFirst, we'll need to find the relevant class or method in Sphinx that is responsible for handling the `:kbd:` role. Since Sphinx extensions and roles are often defined in a structured manner, searching for a class or method directly related to roles or specifically the `kbd` role would be a good start.\n\nThen, considering the nature of Sphinx and its extension mechanism, the `:kbd:` role functionality might be implemented within a directive or a role processing class or method. So, we will search for anything related to the `kbd` role handling or directive processing.\n\nHere are the API calls we can make to start gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Role\")` - To see if there's a generic class for roles that could be extended or used for the `kbd` role.\n2. `search_method(\"visit_kbd\")` - Assuming Sphinx uses the visitor pattern for rendering HTML (common in documentation generators), there might be a method specifically for handling `kbd`.\n3. `search_method(\"depart_kbd\")` - Similarly, to handle the end tag of `kbd`.\n4. `search_code(\":kbd:\")` - This will help us find references in the code where the `:kbd:` role is specifically handled or mentioned.\n\nThese searches should help us narrow down the part of the Sphinx codebase where the issue can be addressed."
