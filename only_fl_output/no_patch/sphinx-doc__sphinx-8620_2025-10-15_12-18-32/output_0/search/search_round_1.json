If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

Given the details in the issue, the focus should be on how Sphinx generates the `<kbd>` HTML elements, including how classes are assigned to these elements.\n\nFirst, we'll need to find the relevant class or method in Sphinx that is responsible for handling the `:kbd:` role. Since Sphinx extensions and roles are often defined in a structured manner, searching for a class or method directly related to roles or specifically the `kbd` role would be a good start.\n\nThen, considering the nature of Sphinx and its extension mechanism, the `:kbd:` role functionality might be implemented within a directive or a role processing class or method. So, we will search for anything related to the `kbd` role handling or directive processing.\n\nHere are the API calls we can make to start gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Role\")` - To see if there's a generic class for roles that could be extended or used for the `kbd` role.\n2. `search_method(\"visit_kbd\")` - Assuming Sphinx uses the visitor pattern for rendering HTML (common in documentation generators), there might be a method specifically for handling `kbd`.\n3. `search_method(\"depart_kbd\")` - Similarly, to handle the end tag of `kbd`.\n4. `search_code(\":kbd:\")` - This will help us find references in the code where the `:kbd:` role is specifically handled or mentioned.\n\nThese searches should help us narrow down the part of the Sphinx codebase where the issue can be addressed."

        "content": "The search results provide a starting point for understanding how Sphinx processes the `:kbd:` role and translates it into HTML. Let's analyze the returned context:\n\n### Analysis of the Context\n\n- **No results for `Role`, `visit_kbd`, or `depart_kbd`**: This indicates that Sphinx might not use a straightforward visitor pattern mechanism with explicit `visit_` and `depart_` methods for `kbd` role processing, or it does not have a specific class named `Role` that we can easily target for modifications. This is common in systems that use more dynamic or generalized approaches to handling custom roles or directives.\n\n- **Found `KeyboardTransform` class in `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py`**: The name and location suggest this class is specifically designed to transform `:kbd:` roles into a more detailed HTML form during the HTML building process. Given the bug description, this class is directly related to our issue because it explicitly mentions transforming the `:kbd:` role, which is at the core of the reported bug.\n\n### Relationship between the Found Code and the Bug\n\nThe `KeyboardTransform` class likely handles the transformation of text within the `:kbd:` role into `<kbd>` HTML tags. Since the reported issue revolves around the inability to style container `<kbd>` elements differently from child `<kbd>` elements for compound keystrokes, this class is almost certainly involved in the process that needs tweaking. The bug fix would entail modifying how the `KeyboardTransform` class generates HTML to differentiate between a single keystroke and compound keystrokes, possibly by adding a CSS class to container `<kbd>` elements for compound keystrokes.\n\n### Intended Behavior of This Part of the Code Regarding the Issue\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended modification in this part of the code would involve:\n\n1. **Identification of Single vs. Compound Keystrokes**: When processing `:kbd:` roles, the `KeyboardTransform` class should intelligently identify whether the role represents a single keystroke or a compound keystroke (e.g., `Shift+X`).\n\n2. **Conditional Class Assignment**: For compound keystrokes, the code should wrap child `<kbd>` elements within a parent `<kbd>` element and assign a distinctive CSS class (e.g., `compound`) to the parent container. This will enable specific CSS targeting for styling compound keystrokes differently from single keystrokes.\n\n### Next Steps for Code Context Collection\n\nGiven these insights, the next step is to get more detailed insight into how `KeyboardTransform` does its processing. Specifically, we should look at the implementation of the `KeyboardTransform` class to understand how it currently handles `:kbd:` roles and generates HTML. This will help us identify exactly where and how to implement the necessary modifications.\n\nAPI Calls to Make Next:\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"KeyboardTransform\", \"sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py\")` - This will help us understand the structure and methods of the `KeyboardTransform` class, specifically how it processes and transforms `:kbd:` roles into HTML.\n  \nBy examining the implementation of the `KeyboardTransform` class, we can devise a strategy for differentiating between single and compound keystrokes in the generated HTML, addressing the reported issue effectively."

Currently, it likely processes all keystrokes uniformly, hence the issue with styling compound keystrokes differently.\n   - For compound keystrokes (e.g., `Shift+X`), the parent `<kbd>` element generated by the `KeyboardTransform` class should include an additional CSS class, such as `compound`, to distinguish it from single keystrokes and other child `<kbd>` elements. This way, CSS can target compound keystroke containers specifically, allowing for different styling as required by the issue report.\n   - The existing functionality for single keystrokes must be preserved, ensuring that they continue to be rendered correctly without the additional `compound` class. Thus, the method(s) undertaking the transformation need conditional logic to check if the keystroke is compound and then, and only then, add the `compound` class to the parent `<kbd>` element.\n   - This enhancement requires logic to parse the `:kbd:` content to detect compound keystrokes (identified by the presence of a plus `+` sign or similar delimiters) and apply the modified HTML structure only in those cases."
