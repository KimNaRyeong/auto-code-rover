kbd role generates HTML that's difficult/impossible to style for compound-keystrokes
**Describe the bug**

The `:kbd:` role doesn't mark container `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class, so they can be styled differently that child `<kbd>` elements representing actual keystrokes.


**To Reproduce**

For the below input

```
:kbd:`A`

:kbd:`Shift+X`
```

the following output is generated:

```html
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>

<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">
  <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>+
  <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd>
</kbd>
```

Now we have a problem here: there is no way to differentiate between the parent container `<kbd>` element and the child `<kbd>` element with CSS selectors! If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).

If you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.

**Expected behavior**

Single keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:

```html
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">A</kbd>
```

For compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:

```html
<kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate">
  <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd>+
  <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd>
</kbd>
```
