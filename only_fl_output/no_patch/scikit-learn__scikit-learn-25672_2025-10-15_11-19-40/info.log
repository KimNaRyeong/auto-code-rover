1637     score (Ideal DCG, obtained for a perfect ranking) to obtain a score between

1639 
1640     This ranking metric returns a high value if true labels are ranked high by
1641     ``y_score``.
1642 
1643     Parameters
1644     ----------
1645     y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
1646         True targets of multilabel classification, or true scores of entities
1647         to be ranked. Negative values in `y_true` may result in an output
1648         that is not between 0 and 1.
1649 
1650         .. versionchanged:: 1.2
1651             These negative values are deprecated, and will raise an error in v1.4.
1652 
1653     y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
1654         Target scores, can either be probability estimates, confidence values,
1655         or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as returned by
1656         "decision_function" on some classifiers).
1657 
1658     k : int, default=None
1659         Only consider the highest k scores in the ranking. If `None`, use all
1660         outputs.
1661 
1662     sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
1663         Sample weights. If `None`, all samples are given the same weight.
1664 
1665     ignore_ties : bool, default=False
1666         Assume that there are no ties in y_score (which is likely to be the
1667         case if y_score is continuous) for efficiency gains.
1668 
1669     Returns
1670     -------
1671     normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain : float in [0., 1.]
1672         The averaged NDCG scores for all samples.

</code><intended_behavior>While the primary logic and functionality of ndcg_score remain correct, an extension in the form of pre-validation or a more descriptive error handling specific to single-element binary y_true inputs could be implemented. This could be as simple as adding a pre-check at the beginning of ndcg_score that detects if y_true is a single-element list and if its contents suggest a binary relevance scenario. If detected, the method should raise a clear, user-friendly error message explaining why NDCG cannot be computed in this scenario. This is to directly address the user experience and provide clarity, as outlined in the issue. This aligns with the proposal to enforce an error specific to single predictions, improving the method's informative output when encountered with inputs that don't logically support NDCG calculation.</intended_behavior>]
