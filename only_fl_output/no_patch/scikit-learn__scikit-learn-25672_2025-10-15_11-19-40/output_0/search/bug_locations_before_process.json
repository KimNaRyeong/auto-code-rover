        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated or complemented with additional logic to gracefully handle the case where the target (y_true) is a binary relevance in a single-element list when computing NDCG. Although the current behavior of raising an error when encountering a binary target is correct to prevent nonsensical NDCG values, the error message or handling could be made more informative specifically for the case of single-element lists. This could involve a conditional check for the list length and binary nature of y_true preceding the current format check, with a customized error message suggesting that NDCG cannot be meaningfully computed for a single-element binary list."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary logic and functionality of ndcg_score remain correct, an extension in the form of pre-validation or a more descriptive error handling specific to single-element binary y_true inputs could be implemented. This could be as simple as adding a pre-check at the beginning of ndcg_score that detects if y_true is a single-element list and if its contents suggest a binary relevance scenario. If detected, the method should raise a clear, user-friendly error message explaining why NDCG cannot be computed in this scenario. This is to directly address the user experience and provide clarity, as outlined in the issue. This aligns with the proposal to enforce an error specific to single predictions, improving the method's informative output when encountered with inputs that don't logically support NDCG calculation."
