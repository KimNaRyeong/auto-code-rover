        "intended_behavior": "This method should include logic to correctly handle situations where the dataset contains NaN values in the grouping variables. The ordering logic, especially the part that generates or uses indices for reordering, needs to ensure it doesn't produce out-of-bounds indices due to NaN-influenced groups. It might require adding a check or preprocessing step to either exclude NaN values from affecting position calculations or explicitly handling them in a manner that doesn't lead to IndexError. This change should preserve the method's ability to reorder datasets based on their original grouping but enhanced to gracefully handle NaN values."

        "intended_behavior": "The inverse permutation function should be adapted to deal with indices potentially affected by NaN groupings more robustly. Specifically, it should either validate the input indices to ensure they are within valid bounds or implement logic to manage indices that could result from NaN-influenced group processing. This adjustment aims to maintain the function's role in generating inverse permutations for reordering but with added resilience against the index errors caused by NaN values. This could mean handling or skipping invalid indices that do not correspond to any position in the array, thus preventing the IndexError."
