Given the confusion from the prior response and considering the constraints and expectations laid out for the standalone `reproducer.py`, I'll make another attempt to write a proper script that meets your criteria accurately. This script ensures to replicate the issue accurately, raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., an `IndexError` occurs as described), and exits with code 0 if the issue is not present. Please note, the given function to print the stack trace has formatting issues (it's missing line breaks for Python syntax), which have been corrected in the script below.

Please ensure your environment is correctly set up to reproduce the original issue with `xarray` and `numpy` packages before running the script.

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def test_groupby_apply_with_nan():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(
        np.random.rand(4,3,5), 
        {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3), "time": np.arange(5)}, 
        ("lat", "lon", "time")
    )

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(
        np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
        {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3)},
        ("lat", "lon")
    )

    # Introducing NaN into 'id' DataArray
    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan

    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
        # If the IndexError is not raised, we assume the issue is fixed
        print("Issue seems to be fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # An AssertionError indicates the issue is still present
        raise AssertionError("IndexError indicates the issue reported is still present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_groupby_apply_with_nan()
```

This script attempts to directly address the reported issue involving `groupby().apply()` on a data array with `NaN` values causing an `IndexError`. The function `test_groupby_apply_with_nan()` reproduces the steps leading to the issue and anticipates catching the `IndexError`. If such an error is caught, it will print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` to denote the issue's presence. Conversely, if no error is encountered, it suggests a resolution or non-existence of the problem, leading to a normal script completion with an exit code of 0.
