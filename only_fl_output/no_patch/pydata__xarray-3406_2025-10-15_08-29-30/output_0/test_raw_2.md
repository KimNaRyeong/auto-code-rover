Given the constraints and the requirement to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed and to correctly handle the stack trace printing, here is a revised version of your request for a standalone `reproducer.py` Python script. Note that I've fixed the stack trace printing function for appropriate Python syntax based on your input.

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4,3,5),
                                  {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3), "time": np.arange(5)},
                                  ("lat", "lon", "time"))
    
    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
                            {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                            ("lat", "lon"))
    
    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan
    
    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Should raise an AssertionError if the specific issue is present
        raise AssertionError("The issue with groupby().apply() on variable with NaNs raising IndexError is still present.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other exceptions that are not the specific IndexError we're testing for
        print("An unexpected error occurred, which was not the original IndexError of interest.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    else:
        # If no errors are raised, then the issue is assumed to be resolved
        print("No error occurred. The issue seems to be resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
```

This script focuses on reproducing the issue described in the original question, handling the potential `IndexError` that might result from executing the given code with `xarray` and `numpy`. It also properly formats and prints the stack trace as per your specification for any caught exceptions, specifically targeting the `IndexError` related to the operation on a dataset containing `NaN` values.

- If the issue is replicable and results in an `IndexError`, a stack trace of the issue is printed, and an `AssertionError` is explicitly raised.
- If the issue is not present and no error occurs, it prints a success message and exits with no error.
- It also handles any unexpected errors by printing the respective stack trace, making debugging more straightforward.
