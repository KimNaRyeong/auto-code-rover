        "intended_behavior": "The current code checks if `y` is an instance of `SparseSeries` and raises a ValueError if so. Since `SparseSeries` is deprecated, this check becomes obsolete with the transition to using a Series with sparse values. The intended behavior here would be to adapt the code to handle a Pandas Series with sparse values correctly. This could involve checking for a Pandas Series where the underlying array type is sparse, and ensuring that the rest of the function correctly identifies the type of target provided, whether sparse or not, without raising an unnecessary exception. It is important to preserve the functionality of correctly identifying other target types (`'binary'`, `'multiclass'`, `'multilabel-indicator'`, etc.) as the function currently does. The update should ensure that inputs that are now expected (e.g., Series with sparse values) are handled appropriately without degrading the function's ability to classify target types accurately."
