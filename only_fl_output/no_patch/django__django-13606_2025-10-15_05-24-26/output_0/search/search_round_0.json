        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to optimizing SQL queries by replacing `NOT IN` with `NOT EXISTS`, we can perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for any method or class that might be directly related to the issue. Since the issue description mentions a specific logic called during excluding a multi-valued relationship, it is likely tied to a particular method. The method mentioned is `sql.Query.split_exclude`, so first, we'll search for this method to understand where it's defined and to get the context of its implementation.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"split_exclude\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue specifically calls out the handling of multi-valued relationships and the optimization of SQL queries, it might be beneficial to look into how these SQL queries are structured in the codebase. However, without knowing the exact classes or files these operations are defined in, it\u2019s hard to target a search. If `split_exclude` provides specific file or class context, we would proceed with more targeted searches based on that information.\n\n3. Assuming the method `split_exclude` is part of a larger query-building framework or class, it's also useful to see if there are related methods or code snippets that handle SQL query construction, particularly focusing on `NOT IN` constructs which might be scattered across the codebase. With the intention of replacing them or seeing their usage context, we might want to search for code snippets containing \"NOT IN\" to identify these patterns:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"NOT IN\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of where the logic for handling multi-valued relationships through SQL queries is implemented and how it might be optimized by transitioning to `NOT EXISTS`. Further actions will depend on the results obtained from these API calls."
