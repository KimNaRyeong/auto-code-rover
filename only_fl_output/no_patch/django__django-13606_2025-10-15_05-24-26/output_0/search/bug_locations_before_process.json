        "intended_behavior": "The current implementation uses a `NOT IN` subquery to exclude records when dealing with N-to-many relationships. The intended modification is to refactor this method to use `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN` to improve query performance and handle NULL values more effectively. The logic within `split_exclude` should be adapted to generate a `NOT EXISTS` subquery for the exclusion filter, ensuring that the new approach still supports the same filtering capabilities while making the query more efficient and reliable, especially regarding NULL handling. This changes aims to preserve the existing functionality of excluding records based on a given set of criteria while improving the method's efficiency and correctness."
