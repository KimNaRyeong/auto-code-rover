It uses the provided function `print_stacktrace` to clearly print the details when an assertion error occurs, indicating the issue is present. \n\nIf the script produces an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace, it means the issue remains unresolved. If, instead, it executes without raising an error, this would indicate the issue has been addressed in the version of SymPy being tested."
