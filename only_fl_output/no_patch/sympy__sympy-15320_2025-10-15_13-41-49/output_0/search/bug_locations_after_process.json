        "intended_behavior": "The constructor of `RootOf` should accurately recognise and maintain the generator of the polynomial even when substitutions alter the generator from a simple symbol to a more complex expression (e.g., `tan(x)`). When a polynomial passed to `RootOf` has undergone a substitution that changes its generator, this new generator should be reflected in the `RootOf` instances created. The code should ensure that any expression transformations, specifically substitutions that affect the generator, do not get ignored. Incorporating a mechanism to check and adapt the generator based on the input polynomial's current form could resolve the issue. This change must preserve the original functionality, allowing `RootOf` to serve its purpose for both simple and complex polynomial expressions."
