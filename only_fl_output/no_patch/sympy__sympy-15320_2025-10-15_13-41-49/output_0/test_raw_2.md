Given the task at hand and the need to adhere to requirements precisely, let's formulate the `reproducer.py` correctly to specifically target the described issue, ensuring it accurately checks for the misuse or mishandling of the generator in `RootOf`.

```python
from sympy import symbols, tan, RootOf

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    x = symbols('x')
    root_of_original = RootOf(x**3 + x - 1, 0)
    # Substitute x with tan(x) to check if the generator gets ignored
    root_of_substituted = RootOf((x**3+x-1).subs(x, tan(x)), 0)
    # Check for the first issue where substitution might ignore the generator
    try:
        assert root_of_substituted.poly.gen != x, "Issue detected: RootOf ignored the new generator"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    
    # Now check directly passing tan(x) to see if it respects the new generator
    root_of_new_form_direct = RootOf(tan(x)**3 + 2*tan(x) - 1, 0)
    root_of_similar_form_new_generator = RootOf((x**3 + 2*x - 1).subs(x, tan(x)), 0)
    try:
        # This is to check if RootOf accurately maintains the generator when the form is similar but the generator changes
        assert root_of_similar_form_new_generator.poly.gen == tan(x), "Issue detected: RootOf did not update the generator as expected"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    check_issue()
```

This script is designed to specifically test for the issues described with `RootOf`'s handling of the generator, particularly when substitutions are involved or when the generator should change but does not. The `AssertionError` is raised only if the tested conditions reveal the issue remains unresolvedâ€”meaning `RootOf` incorrectly handles the generator.

- **First Test:** It checks whether substituting `x` with `tan(x)` incorrectly maintains `x` as the generator, instead of switching to `tan(x)`.
- **Second Test:** It verifies directly using `tan(x)` in a similar polynomial form to see if `RootOf` updates the generator as desired or mistakenly keeps an older reference (this part is specifically designed to capture the second aspect of the issue described).

Running this script should clarify whether the problem persists based on the raised assertions and provided stack traces.
