        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and the issue at hand, we can develop an understanding of how the `expand_trig` function and the `csch` and `sech` classes are implemented and related to the bug.\n\n### Analysis of `expand_trig` Function\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `expand_trig` function in `sympy/core/function.py` is designed to expand trigonometric expressions. It acts as a wrapper around the general `expand` function but specifically uses the `trig=True` hint to ensure that only trigonometric expansion is performed.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  The issue description points out that `expand_trig` does not currently handle `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` as expected. Instead of expanding these expressions similarly to how trigonometric functions `csc` and `sec` are expanded, `expand_trig` leaves them unchanged. The information provided by the `expand_trig` function's implementation suggests that expanding `csch` and `sech` in the desired manner would likely involve modifying how `expand_trig` interacts with expressions involving these functions.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be for `expand_trig` to correctly apply trigonometric expansion rules to `csch` and `sech`, similar to how it operates for `csc` and `sec`. This implies adapting the `expand_trig` logic or the method used by `csch` and `sech` to participate correctly in trigonometric expansion.\n\n### Analysis of `csch` and `sech` Classes\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  Both `csch` and `sech` are defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` as subclasses of `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction`, with `csch` being the reciprocal of `sinh` and `sech` the reciprocal of `cosh`. These classes implement specific behaviors for these hyperbolic functions, including derivatives, rewrites, and properties like oddness/evenness.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  Since `expand_trig` does not expand `csch` and `sech` as expected, the implementation and methods of these classes are directly related to the bug. There may be a need for additional methods or adjustments to existing methods (e.g., rewrite rules) within these classes to enable or improve their expandability by `expand_trig`.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior is for the `csch` and `sech` classes to interact with `expand_trig` such that expressions involving these functions are expanded analogously to their trigonometric counterparts. This may involve defining new rewrite rules or modifying how they are recognized and expanded by the `expand` functionality.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, to move forward with resolving the issue, it's clear there may be a need to:\n1. Investigate how `expand_trig` identifies and applies expansions to trigonometric functions to see if `csch` and `sech` lack corresponding logic or rewrite rules.\n2. Review and possibly extend the rewrite rules or other relevant methods in the `csch` and `sech` class definitions to ensure they can be expanded by `expand_trig`.\n3. Since direct searches for `expand_trig(csc` and `expand_trig(sec` did not yield results, it might be useful to look into how other trigonometric functions are expanded within `expand_trig` by examining the broader implementation of the `expand` method, particularly its handling of trigonometric rules.\n\nTo further these objectives, a next reasonable API call could involve searching for the implementation details of the `expand` method used within `expand_trig`, focusing on its trigonometric handling:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"expand\", \"sympy/core/function.py\")`"

To resolve the issue, this method should also include logic for expanding hyperbolic trigonometric functions like `csch` and `sech`. This involves implementing additional rules or cases within `expand_trig` or the underlying `expand` method it calls, specifically to handle expressions involving `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` to expand them as expected based on hyperbolic trigonometric identities. This expansion should mirror the handling of `csc` and `sec` by using analogous hyperbolic identities while preserving existing functionality for all other expressions.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:** File: `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, Class: `csch`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** The `csch` class may need additional methods or adjustments to existing methods (such as `_eval_expand_trig` if it does not exist or modifications to it if it does) that enable it to be correctly expanded by `expand_trig`. These changes should ensure that expressions involving `csch(x + y)` are expanded using appropriate hyperbolic trigonometric identities, aligning with the behavior for `csc(x + y)`.\n\n- **Bug Location 3:** File: `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, Class: `sech`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `csch`, the `sech` class needs modifications or new implementations that allow for correct expansion within `expand_trig`. This could involve defining a method that directly addresses how `sech(x + y)` expressions are expanded, leveraging the analogous behavior as seen with `sec(x + y)`. The goal is to enable the application of hyperbolic trigonometric identities within the expansion process without disrupting existing functionality.\n\nThe resolution of these issues should together ensure that the `expand_trig` function can expand `csch` and `sech` expressions in a manner consistent with trigonometric functions like `csc` and `sec`, enhancing the library's symbolic capabilities."
