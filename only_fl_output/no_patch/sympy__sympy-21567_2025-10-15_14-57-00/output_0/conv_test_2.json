It specifically checks the functionality that should be affected by the issue (`expand_trig` for `csch` and `sech`) and compares it to an expected behavior (i.e., the expression is modified upon expansion, similar to how it works for `tanh`). The script exits with code 0 if the issue is confirmed, aligned with your specification for handling the reproduction of the issue."
