Below is a simple Python script designed to automate the process of reproducing the issue described. It specifically checks for the insertion of whitespace at the beginning and end of inline code within LaTeX documents generated by Sphinx. When run, it will assert for the absence of unintended spaces around inline code syntax within the produced LaTeX output. If the issue is present, the script will catch an `AssertionError` and print out a detailed stack trace, as per the provided function. If fixed, it will simply exit with code 0, indicating no error.

Please make sure that Sphinx is installed in your Python environment since the script relies on it to generate the LaTeX output from an `rst` source file. Here is the `reproducer.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    conf_py_template = """

    with open("source/index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write(index_rst_template)

def check_for_whitespace_issue():

        # Adjust as necessary to match specifics of the LaTeX output and issue signature
        import re
        if re.search("\\\\sphinxcode{\\s+\\\\sphinxupquote{.+?}\\s+}", content):
            raise AssertionError("Whitespace issue detected in LaTeX output")

def main():
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if any issue is encountered
    print("No issue detected. Exiting.")
    exit(0)

    main()
```

Keep in mind:

- This script assumes you have a working LaTeX environment configured for Sphinx to generate PDFs correctly.
- Adjust the regular expression in `check_for_whitespace_issue()` as needed to match the specific output and formatting introduced by the bug in question.
- Ensure Sphinx is correctly installed and accessible in your environment. This can be done via `pip install sphinx`.
- The script wipes and recreates the Sphinx project in the current directory, so ensure to execute it in a safe, dedicated folder to avoid accidental loss of data.
