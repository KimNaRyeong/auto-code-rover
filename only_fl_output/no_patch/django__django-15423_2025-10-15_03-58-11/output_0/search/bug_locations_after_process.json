        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the intended behavior for LazyObject should involve dynamically determining whether to proxy magic methods like __getitem__ and __iter__ based on the capabilities of the wrapped object. Specifically, LazyObject should proxy these methods only if the wrapped object implements them. This could involve modifying how new_method_proxy is applied, possibly by introducing a check within the __getattr__ method of LazyObject or directly within new_method_proxy to verify the existence of these methods in the wrapped object before proxying them. This approach should preserve the lazy loading functionality of LazyObject while avoiding raising TypeError exceptions when attempting to use unsupported operations on the wrapped object."
