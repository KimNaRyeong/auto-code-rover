        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. LocaleMiddleware in `django/middleware/locale.py`\n- **What this part of the code does:** `LocaleMiddleware` is responsible for processing requests and responses to set up the locale based on the user's preferences, which can be derived from the session, cookies, or the `Accept-Language` HTTP header.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This middleware is likely the component that utilizes the `get_supported_language_variant` function to determine the correct locale from the `Accept-Language` header. The issue seems to arise when the middleware needs to choose between similar language codes (`zh-hans` and `zh-hant`).\n- **Intended behavior:** When presented with an `Accept-Language` header like `zh-Hant-HK`, even if `zh-hans` is listed first in `settings.LANGUAGES`, `LocaleMiddleware` should correctly select `zh-hant` as the preferred language, matching more specifically to the user's preference.\n\n### 2. get_supported_language_variant in `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`\n- **What this part of the code does:** This function goes through the process of determining if the provided `lang_code` is supported, checking against both detailed (`lang-code-country`) and generic (`lang-code`) versions of the language code. If `strict` is False, it also looks for a country-specific variant when the direct language code or its generic variant is not found.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This method is directly involved in the issue as it's responsible for the selection logic that fails to prioritize `zh-Hant-HK` over `zh-hans`. The code snippet indicates that it attempts to find the most appropriate match for the requested language variant against the application's supported languages.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, for an `Accept-Language` header with `zh-Hant-HK`, the function should correctly identify `zh-hant` as the best match rather than reverting to `zh-hans` if both are available in the supported languages list. The method should handle the fallback and language prioritization more accurately to respect the user preferences as indicated by the locale qualifiers.\n\n### 3. settings.LANGUAGES usage\n- **What this part of the code does:** `settings.LANGUAGES` is a standard Django setting containing a tuple of language codes and language names that the application supports. Various components of Django, including templates and translation utilities, use this setting to determine which languages are available for translation and localization.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue mentions that even if both `zh-hans` and `zh-hant` are in `settings.LANGUAGES` (and in the mentioned order), the selection goes to the first one. This indicates a possible misunderstanding or misimplementation in how `get_supported_language_variant` considers the order or specificity of language codes within `settings.LANGUAGES`.\n- **Intended behavior:** The handling of `settings.LANGUAGES` should reflect a preference for language codes that best match the user's request, considering both order and specificity. When faced with variants (`zh-hans` vs `zh-hant`), the application should lean towards the user's explicit or implied preference, possibly inferred through the specificity of their `Accept-Language` header.\n\nThe next steps would involve looking closer at how `get_supported_language_variant` is implemented to handle fallbacks and specificity, especially the logic from lines 488 to 494, which is critical for this issue. It would also be useful to understand `get_languages()` and `check_for_language(code)` to see how they interact with `settings.LANGUAGES` and how they contribute to language selection and fallback logic."

Bug Location 1: File: `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`, Function: `get_supported_language_variant`\n   - **Intended behavior:** This function should prioritize the user's preferred language more accurately when multiple language codes are available and applicable. When evaluating possible language codes (`possible_lang_codes`), especially with variations like `zh-hans` and `zh-hant`, the code should ensure that a more specific match, such as `zh-Hant-HK`, is given precedence over a less specific or generic match when both are present in `settings.LANGUAGES`. This means enhancing the logic around lines 488 to 494 to better handle specificity and perhaps considering the order in which languages are listed in `settings.LANGUAGES`, ensuring it adheres to expected behavior when detailed and generic versions of a language code are both applicable. The function must continue to work as intended for languages without such complexities, ensuring backward compatibility and not affecting existing functionality beyond addressing the reported issue."
