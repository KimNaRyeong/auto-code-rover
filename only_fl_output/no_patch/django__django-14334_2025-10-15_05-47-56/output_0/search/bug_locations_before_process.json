When evaluating possible language codes (possible_lang_codes), especially with variations like zh-hans and zh-hant, the code should ensure that a more specific match, such as zh-Hant-HK, is given precedence over a less specific or generic match when both are present in settings.LANGUAGES. This means enhancing the logic around lines 488 to 494 to better handle specificity and perhaps considering the order in which languages are listed in settings.LANGUAGES, ensuring it adheres to expected behavior when detailed and generic versions of a language code are both applicable. The function must continue to work as intended for languages without such complexities, ensuring backward compatibility and not affecting existing functionality beyond addressing the reported issue."
