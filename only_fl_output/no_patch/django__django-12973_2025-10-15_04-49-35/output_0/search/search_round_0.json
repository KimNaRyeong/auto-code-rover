        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context about the implementation and usage of the `AuthenticationMiddleware` and the system checks related to middleware configuration, especially concerning the `admin` application within Django. This will include understanding the dependencies between `SessionMiddleware` and `AuthenticationMiddleware`, as well as where and how the checks are performed that ensure proper middleware ordering.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to get this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `AuthenticationMiddleware` class:** This will help us understand its implementation, specifically looking into `process_request` where the `AssertionError` mentioned in the issue occurs.\n   - `search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")`\n\n2. **Search for the system checks related to middleware configuration in the admin application:** The issue mentions errors `E408`, `E409`, and `E410`, which are related to middleware configuration checks for the admin application. Understanding where and how these checks are implemented will be crucial.\n   - `search_code(\"admin.E408\")`\n   - `search_code(\"admin.E409\")`\n   - `search_code(\"admin.E410\")`\n\n3. **Get code around the `AssertionError` in the `AuthenticationMiddleware` implementation:** Since the specific line number is not given, we first need to identify where the `AssertionError` is raised in the `process_request` method of `AuthenticationMiddleware`.\n   - First, we need to locate `process_request` method within `AuthenticationMiddleware`.\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"process_request\", \"AuthenticationMiddleware\")`\n   \n   After identifying the file and approximate line number from the first set of search results, a follow-up task would be to use `get_code_around_line` with the specific file and line number, but since we don't have the exact line number yet, this would be a second step based on the output of the first searches."
