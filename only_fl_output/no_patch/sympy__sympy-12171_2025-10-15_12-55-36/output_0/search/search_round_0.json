        "content": "To gather sufficient context for the issue regarding the Mathematica code printer's handling of floats and derivatives, we need to locate the `MCodePrinter` class, and within it, if the `Derivative` and `Float` handling methods (`_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float`) already exist or need modifications as per the issue description. Considering this, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Search for the class to find in which file it is defined:\n   - `search_class(\"MCodePrinter\")`\n\n2. Assuming the `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods might either not exist or need to be checked for their current implementation, we need to find if these methods are already defined in the `MCodePrinter` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Derivative\", \"MCodePrinter\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Float\", \"MCodePrinter\")`\n\nThese steps are crucial for understanding where the modifications suggested in the issue need to be applied, and to examine the current state of the implementation for both handling floats and derivatives in the Mathematica code printer."
