Specifically, for an expression like `Derivative(f(t), t)`, the method should return a string `D[f[t], t]`, which correctly represents the derivative in Mathematica syntax."

        "intended_behavior": "Create a new method `_print_Float` that handles floating-point numbers with exponents in a way that matches Mathematica's syntax. For instance, a Python float represented as `1.0e-4` should be converted into Mathematica's notation `1.0*^-4`. This method should correctly identify and transform the exponent part from `e` to `*^`, ensuring that the floating-point numbers are accurately represented in Mathematica format."
