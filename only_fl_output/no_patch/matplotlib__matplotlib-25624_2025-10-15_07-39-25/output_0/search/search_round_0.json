Searching for the implementation of `tight_layout` method to understand how it is designed to work with `kwargs` and to see if there is a condition checking for `figure.autolayout` while applying those `kwargs`:\n   - `search_method(\"tight_layout\")`\n\n2. Given the issue arises when `figure.autolayout` is set, looking for where this setting is read or applied in the codebase could help in understanding how the `tight_layout` method's behavior is affected by this setting. It's also essential to see if there's a direct reference in the Matplotlib codebase where `figure.autolayout` influences layout decisions:\n   - `search_code(\"figure.autolayout\")`\n   \nWith the information gathered from these API calls, we should be able to obtain enough context on how `tight_layout` kwargs are processed in conjunction with the `figure.autolayout` setting, leading us closer to identifying the root cause of the issue and how to approach fixing it."
