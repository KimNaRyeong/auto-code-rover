        "intended_behavior": "The implementation of `subfigures` should correctly apply `wspace` and `hspace` parameters to adjust the horizontal and vertical spacing between subfigures. Specifically, when a user specifies these parameters, the layout of subfigures created by this method should visually reflect the specified spacings. This necessitates a check that these parameters are not merely accepted but actively influence the layout properties of the resulting subfigures. Any functionality to calculate or adjust layout spacing based on `wspace` and `hspace` needs to ensure these parameters contribute to the final layout calculation process. This behavior would not only resolve the reported issue but also enhance user control over figure layouts in matplotlib, maintaining the library's flexibility and utility for complex visualizations."
