Currently, `autodoc_docstring_signature` can only pick up the first one. It would be nice to be able to pick up all of them.\n</issue>"

We will perform the following API calls for this purpose:\n\n1. **Search for the method handling `autodoc_docstring_signature`**: Since the issue mentions a specific functionality (`autodoc_docstring_signature`), we should first find where this is implemented or handled in the codebase. \n   - `search_method(\"autodoc_docstring_signature\")`\n\n2. **Search for code related to handling overloaded methods**: It's also crucial to understand how the current system processes overloaded methods, as the issue directly relates to this process.\n   - `search_code(\"overloaded methods\")`\n\nThese calls aim to identify relevant sections of the codebase that deal with docstrings and how overloaded methods are detected and documented. With this information, adjustments or enhancements could be proposed to improve handling of overloaded method signatures in docstrings."
