This might involve searching for popular Python documentation tools like Sphinx or any custom documentation scripts.\n   - `search_code(\"Sphinx\")`\n   - `search_code(\"docstring\")`\n\n3. **Explore how method documentation is generated**: Since our initial search for the handling of overloaded methods and the specific method `autodoc_docstring_signature` was unsuccessful, we might need to look into how methods are generally documented in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"def\")`\n\nWith these searches, we aim to find how SWIG-wrapped classes and methods are documented, possibly uncovering the mechanism responsible for extracting and displaying method signatures in docstrings, which could then be adapted to handle overloaded methods more effectively."
