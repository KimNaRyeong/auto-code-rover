        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how Django handles 404 errors and how this relates to the reported issue. Let's break down the findings from each relevant piece of information.\n\n### `page_not_found` Function in `django/views/defaults.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - The `page_not_found` function is Django's default handler for 404 errors. It attempts to render a template named `ERROR_404_TEMPLATE_NAME` by default, which should be `404.html`. If this template is not found or if a custom template name is not provided, it falls back to rendering a simple hardcoded HTML string.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n    - This function directly relates to the issue because it controls the rendering of the 404 error page when `DEBUG=False`. The reported issue is that the default 404 page in production (i.e., `DEBUG=False`) lacks proper HTML structure. The fallback rendering\u2014lines 57 to 60\u2014reveals that by default, a simple string containing an `h1` and `p` tag is served when the `404.html` template is missing, which corresponds to the behavior observed in the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n    - The intended behavior would be to ensure that, even in the fallback scenario (when `404.html` is not available), the output is a correctly formed HTML document, including `doctype`, `html`, and `body` tags, not just an `h1` and `p`.\n\n### `Http404` Class in `django/http/response.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - The `Http404` class is a simple exception class used throughout Django to indicate a 404 error should be raised. It doesn\u2019t do much on its own but acts as a marker for the Django handling machinery to invoke the appropriate error handling.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n    - While the `Http404` class itself is not directly responsible for generating the 404 pages, it is related to the overall handling process. When raised, it signals to Django that a 404 error has occurred, leading to the invocation of the `page_not_found` function or another custom handler if specified.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n    - There's no direct action required for the `Http404` class concerning the issue, but understanding its role is crucial for comprehending the error handling flow in Django.\n\n### References to `DEBUG=False` in the Codebase\n\n- **General relationship:** These references indicate how Django behaves differently when in debug mode vs. production mode (i.e., `DEBUG=True` vs. `DEBUG=False`). Notably, these behaviors can impact error logging and page rendering.\n\n### Actions Based on Analysis\n\nFrom the analysis, it's clear that to address the issue:\n- Modify the fallback rendering logic in `page_not_found` to include a full HTML document structure, thus ensuring even the default or backup error page is correctly formed HTML.\n- This involves changing the hardcoded string in lines 57-59 to a more complete HTML template code that wraps the original content within `html` and `body` tags, essentially following the structure outlined in the issue description."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Right now, it generates a minimal content with just an `h1` and a `p` tag. This should be wrapped within a standard HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Not Found</title></head><body>...</body></html>`) to ensure the output is a correctly formed HTML document. This modification preserves the method's existing functionality by still providing a default error message when a specific `404.html` template is not found or provided, but enhances it by ensuring the result is a complete HTML page, thus addressing the issue reported."
