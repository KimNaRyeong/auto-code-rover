Search for where the default error pages, including 404, might be defined or handled in Django. This likely involves searching for classes or methods that are responsible for rendering or returning error pages when `DEBUG=False`. A good starting point could be looking for anything related to error handling such as views that handle 404 errors or middleware.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_method(\"page_not_found\")\n- search_class(\"Http404\")\n- search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")\n\n2. If Django uses a specific method or class to handle 404 errors when debug mode is off (`DEBUG=False`), we need to find it. This could involve finding methods that are specifically responsible for rendering the 404 pages or any middleware that might intercept the response process to insert the default error page.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_method_in_class(\"get_template_names\", \"Http404\")\n- search_code(\"return HttpResponseNotFound\")\n\nThese API calls aim to find the relevant parts of the code where the issue might originate from and provide a comprehensive context to address the issue described."
