Search for the system checks related to models and indexes. Usually, system checks involve a specific framework method or class, so identifying any existing system checks around models or indexes would be helpful:\n   - `search_method(\"check\")`\n   - `search_class(\"SystemCheck\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions `Meta.indexes` specifically related to functional indexes, which are a relatively new feature in databases and ORMs, finding where these are defined or handled in code would provide insight:\n   - `search_code(\"Meta.indexes\")`\n\n3. Understanding how `Query._gen_cols()` works, as resolving expressions without throwing `FieldError` is highlighted in the issue description. Since this is where the system presumably breaks due to invalid fields in expressions, getting context here is crucial:\n   - `search_method(\"Query._gen_cols\")`\n\n4. There's a mention of following up to `#26167`, implying that there was a related issue or change that this task is building upon or correcting. Finding this could give background on what was previously done and why further changes are now needed. If there are comments, commits, or documentation within the codebase regarding this, it might help:\n   - `search_code(\"#26167\")`\n\nThese calls aim to gather sufficient codebase context around defining and checking indexes, handling field names in those indexes, and any related system check mechanisms that enforce integrity or validations at the model level."

        "content": "Given the context collected from the API calls and considering the gaps where specific searches did not return results, let's analyze and plan the next steps.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### Search Results for `check`\n\nFrom the search results, it's noticeable that the `check` method appears in various parts of the Django framework, including models, fields, and contrib packages. This dispersed use suggests that Django employs a pattern of checks across its components to ensure configurations and definitions are correct. The `check` method's ubiquity underscores its potential role in implementing the necessary checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes, particularly within models and fields where the bulk of such validation logic would likely reside.\n\n#### `Meta.indexes` in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`\n\nThe snippet from `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` within the `_model_indexes_sql` method provides insight into how Django generates SQL for indexes, including those specified in `Meta.indexes`. This method's handling of all index types for a model suggests a possible intervention point for checking the validity of field names in functional indexes. Given the issue's focus on validating field names within functional indexes, this function's behavior concerning `Meta.indexes` implies that it, or a similar area, could be an entry point for implementing additional validation logic before index SQL generation occurs.\n\n#### Missed Searches: `SystemCheck` Class and `Query._gen_cols` Method\n\nThe absence of results for the `SystemCheck` class (likely due to incorrect class name) and the `Query._gen_cols` method (potentially indicating a typo, misinterpretation, or an internal, undocumented method) highlights a gap in the investigation. Understanding Django's system check framework and how queries handle column generation would be instrumental in crafting a solution.\n\n### Next Steps and Additional Context Needed\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps involve:\n\n1. **Rectify Missed Searches:**\n   - The search for `SystemCheck` was probably meant for Django's system check framework, which might not be exactly named \"SystemCheck\". A better approach might involve searching for known system check functions or entries, such as `django.core.checks`.\n   - Reassess the search for `Query._gen_cols`, considering alternatives or closely related methods vital for query and index handling.\n\n2. **Deep Dive into System Checks for Models and Fields:**\n   - To understand how the current system checks work, especially around models and fields which are more relevant to our issue, detailed analysis is needed. This could involve examining particular classes or methods identified from the initial `check` method search, like in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` or `django/db/models/fields/related.py`.\n\n3. **Clarifying Reference to #26167:**\n   - Given no direct hits were found for #26167, it might be useful to search related documentation, commit messages, or external resources that might clarify prior work or discussions related to this issue.\n\n4. **Exploring `django/db/models/query_utils.py`:**\n   - Since the expected `Query._gen_cols` method was not found, exploring related query handling classes or methods, possibly within `query_utils.py` or similar files, could provide insights into how Django manages column references in queries\u2014essential for understanding how to intercept and validate functional index expressions.\n\nFollowing these steps, specific API calls that could be useful include:\n- Searching within Django's documentation or code comments for references to system checks and query column handling.\n- Additional API calls to explore related methods:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"check\", \"django/core/checks.py\")` (if this is a correct path for Django's check framework)\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"Query\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")` (assuming `Query`-related logic is contained here or in a similar file)"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The intended behavior here would be to extend this method or add a preliminary step to it that performs a check on the validity of model field names within functional indexes defined in `Meta.indexes`. This check should ensure that any expressions used within functional indexes refer to valid fields on the model. If invalid fields are detected, the system should raise an appropriate warning or error before proceeding with SQL generation. This validation step should be designed to only affect models with functional indexes, preserving the existing functionality for all other models and index types.\n\nGiven the information available and the absence of other identified specific locations directly related to implementing system checks around `Meta.indexes`, this is the primary location where adjustments would be made to address the issue described. The extension or adaptation of checks in this area would directly contribute to resolving the oversight of invalid model fields in functional indexes, adhering to Django's overarching system check strategy to ensure model and database integrity before runtime."
