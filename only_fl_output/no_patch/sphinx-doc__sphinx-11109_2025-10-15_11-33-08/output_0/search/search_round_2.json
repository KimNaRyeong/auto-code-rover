Instead, it is much cleaner to display them using the PEP 604 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) syntax:\n`Union[X, Y, Z]` -> `X | Y | Z`\n`Optional[X]` -> `X | None`\nAdditionally, for `Literal` it is cleaner to strip the text \"Literal\" and just display the literal value with normal Python syntax highlighting:\n`Literal[\"X\"]` -> `\"X\"`\nThis is implemented in the tensorstore documentation via an ast transformation:\nhttps://github.com/google/tensorstore/blob/1a59fcb310bc1feb13569f03f7134b4c3a5fa5f4/docs/tensorstore_sphinx_ext/autodoc.py#L259\nThis should be supported in Sphinx via a config option.

It defines a set of directives and roles specific to documenting Python code, such as functions, classes, methods, attributes, and more. This class does not directly address type annotation formatting but establishes a framework for how Python constructs are documented.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `PythonDomain` class manages the representation and linking of Python-specific constructs within Sphinx documentation. It includes directives for documenting various elements of Python code (functions, classes, methods, etc.) and roles for creating references to these elements. It also handles indexing and cross-referencing of Python objects within the documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   Although the search did not directly find the `_parse_annotation` method within the `PythonDomain` class, indicating the method might not be a part of it or perhaps located elsewhere in the code, `PythonDomain` sets the overall context for how Python elements, potentially including type annotations, are handled in Sphinx. The issue is related to improving the representation of type annotations (`Union`, `Optional`, `Literal`, etc.) within the Python domain that Sphinx documents. This suggests that the solution might include modifying how `PythonDomain` or related components parse and render type annotations.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would involve enhancing the parsing and rendering logic associated with type annotations within Python documentation to support the more concise and readable syntax as per PEP 604. This would likely entail intercepting type annotations before they are rendered and reformulating them into the cleaner syntax (e.g., transforming `Union[X, Y]` into `X | Y` and `Literal[\"X\"]` into just `\"X\"`). Since `PythonDomain` manages the structure around documenting Python constructs, the actual parsing and transformation might occur in methods that process the information for documentation output, possibly within or called by functions managed by `PythonDomain`.\n\nGiven the absence of `_parse_annotation` within the `PythonDomain`, the next steps could involve looking for this method or relevant annotation parsing logic elsewhere in the codebase, potentially in utility functions or in components responsible for rendering the directive and role content defined by `PythonDomain`.\n\nTo get more context on the issue, we should consider the following actions:\n- Investigate the codebase for `_parse_annotation` or similar functions related to type annotation parsing and formatting.\n- Search within broader python domain-related files or utility files that may handle type information rendering. \n\nPossible search queries might include: \n- Searching for a method or code snippet related to parsing type annotations.\n- Exploring closer to where type annotations are likely to be rendered or modified in the documentation process."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Specifically, it should:\n- Convert `Union[X, Y]` into `X | Y` notation.\n- Convert `Optional[X]` into `X | None`.\n- Simplify `Literal[\"X\"]` to just `\"X\"` for display purposes.\n- Preserve the existing functionality for parsing and displaying other types of annotations not mentioned in the issue by falling back to the current handling method.\n\nThis intended behavior targets improving the readability and conciseness of type annotations in Python documentation generated by Sphinx, aligning with recent Python enhancements (PEP 604). The modifications would likely involve adding logic to detect these specific type hint patterns and transforming them into the desired format while keeping the original handling intact for type annotations that don't match these patterns. Additionally, implementing this functionality behind a config option, as suggested in the issue, ensures that users can opt into this new syntax formatting based on their preferences or requirements."
