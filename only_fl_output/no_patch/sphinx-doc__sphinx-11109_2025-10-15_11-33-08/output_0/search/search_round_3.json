Instead, it is much cleaner to display them using the PEP 604 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) syntax:\n`Union[X, Y, Z]` -> `X | Y | Z`\n`Optional[X]` -> `X | None`\nAdditionally, for `Literal` it is cleaner to strip the text \"Literal\" and just display the literal value with normal Python syntax highlighting:\n`Literal[\"X\"]` -> `\"X\"`\nThis is implemented in the tensorstore documentation via an ast transformation:\nhttps://github.com/google/tensorstore/blob/1a59fcb310bc1feb13569f03f7134b4c3a5fa5f4/docs/tensorstore_sphinx_ext/autodoc.py#L259\nThis should be supported in Sphinx via a config option.

It defines a set of directives and roles specific to documenting Python code, such as functions, classes, methods, attributes, and more. This class does not directly address type annotation formatting but establishes a framework for how Python constructs are documented.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `PythonDomain` class manages the representation and linking of Python-specific constructs within Sphinx documentation. It includes directives for documenting various elements of Python code (functions, classes, methods, etc.) and roles for creating references to these elements. It also handles indexing and cross-referencing of Python objects within the documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   Although the search did not directly find the `_parse_annotation` method within the `PythonDomain` class, indicating the method might not be a part of it or perhaps located elsewhere in the code, `PythonDomain` sets the overall context for how Python elements, potentially including type annotations, are handled in Sphinx. The issue is related to improving the representation of type annotations (`Union`, `Optional`, `Literal`, etc.) within the Python domain that Sphinx documents. This suggests that the solution might include modifying how `PythonDomain` or related components parse and render type annotations.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would involve enhancing the parsing and rendering logic associated with type annotations within Python documentation to support the more concise and readable syntax as per PEP 604. This would likely entail intercepting type annotations before they are rendered and reformulating them into the cleaner syntax (e.g., transforming `Union[X, Y]` into `X | Y` and `Literal[\"X\"]` into just `\"X\"`). Since `PythonDomain` manages the structure around documenting Python constructs, the actual parsing and transformation might occur in methods that process the information for documentation output, possibly within or called by functions managed by `PythonDomain`.\n\nGiven the absence of `_parse_annotation` within the `PythonDomain`, the next steps could involve looking for this method or relevant annotation parsing logic elsewhere in the codebase, potentially in utility functions or in components responsible for rendering the directive and role content defined by `PythonDomain`.\n\nTo get more context on the issue, we should consider the following actions:\n- Investigate the codebase for `_parse_annotation` or similar functions related to type annotation parsing and formatting.\n- Search within broader python domain-related files or utility files that may handle type information rendering. \n\nPossible search queries might include: \n- Searching for a method or code snippet related to parsing type annotations.\n- Exploring closer to where type annotations are likely to be rendered or modified in the documentation process."

It uses Python's `ast` module to parse the annotation string and then processes the abstract syntax tree (AST) to transform it into Sphinx documentation nodes. This involves converting AST nodes representing various Python constructs (like literals, attributes, binary operations, etc.) into their corresponding Sphinx documentation counterparts, ensuring they are correctly displayed in the generated documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The function directly relates to the reported issue, as it is responsible for parsing and formatting type annotations. The issue stems from the need to improve the formatting of certain types of annotations (`Union`, `Optional`, `Literal`, and constants) to make them cleaner and more readable according to PEP 604 syntax and best practices in Python documentation. The current implementation translates AST nodes into Sphinx nodes but does not apply the specific enhancements proposed in the issue to these special types of annotations.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would involve modifying the `_parse_annotation` function to specifically handle the cases outlined in the issue:\n   - Transform `Union[X, Y]` into `X | Y`.\n   - Transform `Optional[X]` into `X | None`.\n   - Display literals (in `Literal` annotations) directly without the preamble \"Literal\".\n   - Ensure constants are displayed with syntax highlighting appropriate to their types.\n   \n   This could be achieved by introducing special handling logic within the `unparse` inner function for the `ast.Subscript` node types that represent `Union` and `Optional` annotations, applying the PEP 604 syntax where applicable. For `Literal` annotations, it would involve checking the `ast.Subscript` node value and implementing logic to directly display the contained literals. The existing code shows some handling logic for `Union` and `Optional` within `_unparse_pep_604_annotation`, which might be adapted or extended to achieve the desired formatting enhancements.\n\nModifications would need to be made carefully to ensure that these changes do not interfere with the existing functionality for other types of annotations and that they preserve the modularity and readability of the code. This could also involve adding or extending utility functions to better encapsulate the new logic for handling these specific cases."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

These enhancements include:\n\n- For `Union` type annotations, directly handle AST nodes representing the union (e.g., `ast.BinOp` nodes with `ast.BitOr` operators) to output `X | Y` instead of `Union[X, Y]`.\n- For `Optional` type annotations, detect patterns matching `Optional[X]` and transform them into `X | None`.\n- For `Literal` type annotations, simplify the display of literals by removing the \"Literal\" preamble and displaying the values directly, applying normal Python syntax highlighting to these literals to differentiate them clearly in the documentation.\n- Maintain the existing functionality for all other types of annotations not specifically mentioned in the issue, ensuring that the solution is backward compatible and does not negatively impact the formatting of other types of annotations.\n- Implement these changes behind a configuration option, allowing Sphinx users to opt-in to this new style of type annotation display. This would likely involve adding a new configuration parameter and modifying the Sphinx build environment to conditionally apply these formatting rules based on the user's configuration.\n\nThe modifications should focus on extending or adapting the inner functions within `_parse_annotation`, such as the `unparse` function and possibly introducing a new helper function (like the existing `_unparse_pep_604_annotation`) to encapsulate the logic for handling `Union` and `Optional` in the PEP 604 style, ensuring the code remains readable and maintainable.\n\nAdditionally, attention should be given to correctly integrating these changes with the rest of the Sphinx build process, particularly in how type annotations are processed and displayed in the generated documentation, to ensure a seamless user experience and no disruption to existing documentation projects not opting into this new formatting."
