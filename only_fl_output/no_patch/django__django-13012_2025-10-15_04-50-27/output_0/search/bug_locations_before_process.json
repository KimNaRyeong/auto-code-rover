The modification should detect when the expression is a constant (e.g., using Value) and handle it such that it does not break SQL syntax rules for databases like PostgreSQL. This behavior should preserve existing functionality for non-constant expressions, maintaining the versatility of ExpressionWrapper in annotating querysets with both dynamic and constant data."

        "intended_behavior": "The GROUP BY assembling logic within this file should be revised to correctly handle constant expressions, particularly those wrapped in ExpressionWrapper. This involves ensuring that such expressions do not result in a GROUP BY clause that includes constants, as this is invalid in SQL queries for certain databases (like PostgreSQL). The intended behavior should allow for constants to be included in the SELECT part of the query without being added to GROUP BY, maintaining correct query results while adhering to SQL standards."
