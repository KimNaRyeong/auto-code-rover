To properly reproduce the issue in a self-contained Python script that uses Django ORM and simulates the error with `ExpressionWrapper` leading to an unexpected `GROUP BY` clause in SQL queries, follow the steps below. This script will create a minimal Django environment programmatically, define a model, and run queries that trigger the described issue. Upon encountering the issue, it will print a stack trace as requested.

```python

reproducer.py

# Ensure Django settings are configured before importing ORM components

import django
from django.conf import settings

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Define a simple model to work with

        list(query_result)  # Forces evaluation of the QuerySet
        # If no exception occurred, the issue is presumably fixed
        print("Test passed: No issue detected. Exiting normally.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "GROUP BY" in str(e), "Expected issue about GROUP BY not found."
        print("Test failed: Issue detected as expected.")
        sys.exit(1)

    test_query()
```

This script creates a minimal Django application with a single model and demonstrates the issue by attempting to execute a query that should trigger the described error when using an `ExpressionWrapper` with a constant value. It captures any exceptions raised during the query execution, prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and exits with code 0 if no issue is detected, indicating that the problem is presumably fixed.

To run this script:
1. Ensure Django is installed in your environment: `pip install django`
2. Place the script in the root directory of your project.
3. Execute the script using Python 3: `python3 reproducer.py`

The script intentionally exits with code 1 when the issue is reproduced (detected as expected), following the initial instructions.
