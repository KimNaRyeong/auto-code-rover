This script defines two classes inline: `Parent`, with a documented class method, and `Child` that overrides the `Parent.method` without any documentation. It then compares the documentation strings (docstrings) of the two class methods. If the child class's method docstring is not the same as the parent's (i.e., the documentation is not inherited by the overridden method in the child class), an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the presence of the issue. The exception's stack trace is printed to give more context about the failure point. The script exits with code zero if the issue is fixed, signifying that the child class's method inherited the parent's documentation as expected.
