        "intended_behavior": "The method `__aiter__` in `StreamingHttpResponse` should ideally handle both synchronous and asynchronous iterators without issuing a warning, especially in contexts where asynchronous operation is expected but synchronous iterators are encountered. The intended behavior could include an automatic conversion mechanism that detects if the `streaming_content` is a synchronous iterator and seamlessly converts it to an asynchronous one without issuing a warning. This behavior would ensure that `StreamingHttpResponse` remains backward compatible while also being fully functional in an ASGI environment. Essentially, the warning can be replaced or supplemented by a conversion step that only activates under ASGI conditions, ensuring that all iterators are served asynchronously without any manual intervention from the developer or unnecessary warnings cluttering the console."
