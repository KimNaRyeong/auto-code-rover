        "intended_behavior": "The `ManyToManyField` construction should include logic to check for `related_name='+'` and handle models with identical names across different apps without raising a `fields.E305` error. The check that triggers this error needs to be adjusted so that it properly respects the intention behind `related_name='+'`, which is to avoid the creation of reverse relations. This should preserve the functionality of allowing models to explicitly not have reverse accessors and preventing the clash detection logic from flagging this as an error during migration generation."

Since this file deals with the descriptors that manage these relations, it's crucial to verify that `related_name='+'` effectively disables reverse relation checks or name clashes in the migrations' logic."
