Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to reproduce the issue you're experiencing with Flask's nested blueprints when mounted on subdomains, and not when using `url_prefix`. It attempts to access the child route under the subdomain setup and triggers an `AssertionError` if the response code is not 200 (OK), indicating the issue is present. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, so ensure it's installed in your environment (`pip install requests`).

```python
import requests
from flask import Flask, Blueprint

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config["SERVER_NAME"] = "localhost:5000"
    parent = Blueprint("parent", __name__, subdomain="api")
    child = Blueprint("child", __name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return "index"

    @parent.route('/')
    def parent_index():
        return "parent"

    @child.route('/child/')
    def child_index():
        return "child"

    parent.register_blueprint(child)
    app.register_blueprint(parent)
    return app

def assert_child_route_accessible():
    response = requests.get('http://api.localhost:5000/child/', headers={"Host": "api.localhost:5000"})
    assert response.status_code == 200, "Child route is not accessible under the subdomain setup."

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = create_app()
    with app.app_context():
        try:
            assert_child_route_accessible()
            print("Test passed: Child route is accessible under the subdomain setup.")
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script:

1. Sets up a Flask application with nested blueprints, exactly like your example.
2. Adds a testing function `assert_child_route_accessible` that tries to access the child route under the subdomain configuration and checks if the response status code is `200`.
3. In the main block, it runs the app in a context and checks the accessibility of the nested child route. If an `AssertionError` is caught, it prints a stack trace indicating where the test failed, which means the issue is present.
4. It exits with code `0` if everything works as expected (i.e., the issue is fixed).

To make the HTTP request, ensure your environment can resolve `api.localhost` to `127.0.0.1` (this is usually handled in the `/etc/hosts` file on Unix-like systems or the equivalent on Windows).
