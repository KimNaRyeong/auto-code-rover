        "content": "To start addressing the issue about customizing which items are displayed per language in the Sitemap with respect to the internationalization (i18n) setup, we need to identify the classes and methods that handle the Sitemap generation and the i18n process. The description hints at a mechanism that generates a Cartesian product of items and languages, which suggests there are specific functions or classes managing Sitemap creation and i18n content decision-making. We might look for classes or methods like `SitemapGenerator`, `I18n`, or anything related to `items` and `languages`.\n\nFirst, we should find the class responsible for Sitemap generation and any classes or methods dealing with internationalization (i18n). Also, it would be useful to search for how urls are handled for different languages as mentioned in the issue. Here are some initial API calls to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SitemapGenerator\")`\n2. `search_class(\"I18n\")`\n3. `search_method(\"generate_sitemap\")`\n4. `search_code(\"cartesian product items languages\")`\n5. `search_code(\"url language\")`\n\nThese searches will help us to pinpoint the parts of the codebase that are relevant to the issue at hand."
