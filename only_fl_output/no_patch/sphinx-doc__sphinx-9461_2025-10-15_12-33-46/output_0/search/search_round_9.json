Also, the attempt to directly find uses of the `@classmethod` decorator followed immediately by the `@property` decorator returned no results, suggesting either a potential typo in the search or that these decorators are used in a context that wasn't captured by the direct search string provided.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the original issue mentions that Sphinx does not document methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`, and our initial search queries returned no results, we should broaden our search strategy. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Search for modules or filenames mentioned in the issue instead of class names:**\n   - Since we know the issue originates from a specific repository (`randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo`), looking for specific file names mentioned (`dummy_module.submodule`) might offer some insight. For instance, if we know the file structure from the issue or the repository description, we could directly search within those files.\n   \n2. **Generalized search for documentation strings and Sphinx configurations:**\n   - Since the issue is with Sphinx documentation, searching for Sphinx configuration files (`conf.py`) or annotations could help understand how Sphinx is set to autodocument the codebase. However, without direct access to content from the repository, we can only hypothesize this step.\n\nGiven the inability to directly query external repositories and the generic nature of API search results (interpreted as abstracted functions within this scenario), let's broaden the search with hypothetical yet logically consistent API calls:\n\n- **Search for potential Sphinx configuration or related files:**\n  - `search_file(\"conf.py\")`: To locate the Sphinx configuration file and understand how autodoc is configured.\n  \n- **Broaden the search to find where decorators are applied:**\n  - Since a direct search for `@classmethod` followed by `@property` yielded no results, consider breaking down the search to either decorator to find how they are individually used:\n    - `search_code(\"@classmethod\")`\n    - `search_code(\"@property\")`\n    \n- **Search for the module and submodule mentioned in the reproduction steps:**\n  - Given that the issue reproduction steps involve navigating to `dummy_module.submodule`, a closer look into these might help:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"dummy_module.submodule\", \"dummy_module/submodule.py\")`: Assuming a direct mapping from module name to file path, which might involve searching for the documentation block or specific decorator usage in this context.\n\nNote: The suggestions involve hypothetical file names and structures based on the information from the issue and standard Python project organization principles. Without direct matches from the initial queries, these hypothetical steps are designed to broaden the search scope in a manner that aligns with common debugging and code investigation practices."

Since the actual source code or specific details such as file paths and method implementations were not provided in the search results, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact bug locations or suggest the intended behavior to resolve the issue accurately. However, based on the description of the problem in the issue, we can hypothesize a general approach to address the issue:\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Location and Intended Behavior:\n\n#### Bug Location:\n- **File:** (Assumed) `dummy_module/submodule.py` or similar files where classes are defined with methods decorated by both `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n- **Classes:** `MetaClass`, `BaseClass`, `SubClass` or any class that attempts to use `@classmethod` decorator together with `@property` decorator.\n- **Methods:** Methods that were intended to be documented but were not, such as `metaclass_class_property`, `baseclass_class_property`, `subclass_class_property`, and their respective abstract counterparts.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nThe intended behavior would be to ensure that methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` are correctly recognized and documented by Sphinx. Since the issue pointed out that Sphinx fails to document these methods due to the way Python treats combined `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators, the resolution would likely involve adjusting how these combined decorators are implemented or how Sphinx is configured to recognize and document such methods.\n\nA potential solution could involve creating a custom descriptor or modifying Sphinx configurations to ensure that it correctly introspects and documents methods decorated in this manner. This would involve ensuring that the combined use of these decorators does not obscure the method's docstring from Sphinx during the documentation generation process.\n\nWithout specific source code or error messages from Sphinx, suggesting an exact code change is speculative. However, ensuring that Sphinx can access the docstring and recognize the method as a class property would be the goal. This might involve verifying compatibility issues noted with Python versions (as mentioned, Python 3.10 was expected to introduce changes that could affect this behavior) and ensuring Sphinx is adequately configured to utilize these python enhancements.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, developers working on this would need to review how Sphinx's autodoc extension interacts with Python's descriptor protocol, especially in cases where decorators are used in combination, to formulate an effective patch."

These searches aim to cast a wider net, possibly catching relevant configurations or usage patterns indirectly related to the problematic decorators and documentation issues.\n\n### Constructed Search API Calls for More Context\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx Configuration:**\n   - As documentation generation issues are involved, locating the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) might provide insights into how documentation is set up, including any custom settings for autodoc or extensions that could affect the behavior of documenting class methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n   ```python\n   search_file(\"conf.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Broaden the Search for Decorator Usage:**\n   - Since direct searches for combined use of `@classmethod` and `@property` returned no results, it may help to look for these decorators used individually, which could lead to discovering the relevant class definitions by following the trail from there. This two-step approach may circumvent the fact that direct combo searches failed.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"@classmethod\")\n   search_code(\"@property\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Look for Documentation Strings:**\n   - Finding how docstrings are written and placed in the code can give clues to whether there's a specific pattern or unusual structure that Sphinx might not handle well. This might indirectly lead to discovering the areas where the documented entities work as expected versus where they fail.\n   ```python\n   search_code('\"\"\"')\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for Explicit References to the Metaclasses:**\n   - Given that metaclasses were mentioned but not found, searching for any explicit instantiation or reference to metaclass behavior might reveal how they are utilized, potentially unearthing the connected problematic documentation aspects.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"class Meta:\")\n   ```\n\nThe goal of these additional API calls is to gather more context indirectly related to the issue, hoping to piece together how Sphinx's documentation process is integrated with the Python codebase in question, and identifying potential mismatches or overlooked configurations that lead to the observed issue."

Verify their syntax and structure against Python's official documentation to ensure compatibility. Especially, since Python 3.9 introduced changes allowing more complex uses of decorators, it's crucial to follow the most up-to-date practices.\n\n2. **Sphinx Documentation Review**:\n   - Examine the latest Sphinx documentation for any references or guidelines specific to documenting properties and class methods, including new features or modifications in recent versions that might affect documentation generation.\n\n3. **Sphinx Configuration Check**:\n   - Inspect your `conf.py` file for Sphinx and review any custom settings or extensions that might interfere with the automatic documentation of certain Python constructs. Adjustments here could include expanding the patterns for autodoc discovery or ensuring compatibility with recent Python versions.\n\n4. **Test with Python 3.10**:\n   - The issue description hinted at improvements in Python 3.10 regarding attribute inheritance for class methods and static methods. If possible, test your project with Python 3.10 or newer to see if the behavior changes due to the Python update.\n\n5. **Community and External Resources**:\n   - Search for discussions or bug reports on the Sphinx GitHub repository, Stack Overflow, or mailing lists that might relate to your issue. It's possible others have encountered similar challenges and shared solutions or workarounds.\n\n6. **Direct Modification or Custom Extension**:\n   - Consider implementing a custom Sphinx extension if your documentation needs can't be met with current capabilities. A custom extension can provide more granular control over the documentation process, potentially allowing you to overcome limitations with the current setup.\n\n7. **Contribute Back**:\n   - If you devise a solution or discover valuable insights during your investigation, consider contributing back to the community. Whether it's a bug report, a feature request, or a documentation update, your contributions can help improve Sphinx for everyone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAddressing complex issues like the one you've described often requires a multi-faceted approach, combining code review, configuration adjustments, and sometimes changes to your toolchain version or setup.

Since actual API calls and adjustments were not possible in this interaction, let's summarize actionable steps you can take within your project environment to address and potentially solve the problem:\n\n### Steps to Address the Documentation Issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python and Sphinx Versions**: Ensure you are using the latest versions of Python and Sphinx that your project can support. Given the note about Python 3.10 potentially affecting the behavior of combined `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators, testing with Python 3.10 or newer could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Review Sphinx Configuration**: Dive into your `conf.py` Sphinx configuration file to examine how autodocumentation is set up. Specifically look for `autodoc` settings that might influence how class properties and methods are documented.\n\n3. **Examine Decorator Use**: Manually review the use of `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators in your code to ensure they are applied in a manner consistent with Python's expectations and Sphinx's ability to document them. This might involve looking for alternative ways to achieve the same functionality if the combined use of these decorators continues to cause issues with documentation.\n\n4. **Consult Community Resources**: Look for discussions or resolutions related to documenting `@classmethod` and `@property` in Sphinx within the Sphinx documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, or other Python community forums. Given the specific nature of this issue, others might have encountered and solved similar problems.\n\n5. **Custom Sphinx Extensions or Directives**: If the issue can't be resolved through configuration or by aligning with best practices, consider creating a custom Sphinx extension or directive to handle the documentation of these methods explicitly. Sphinx is highly extensible, allowing for custom solutions to specific documentation challenges.\n\n6. **Contribute Fixes or Workarounds**: Should you find a solution through custom extensions, configuration tweaks, or code alterations, consider sharing your findings with the Sphinx and Python communities. Submitting a patch to the official repositories or documenting your approach can help others who might face similar challenges.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct execution of API calls or adjustments based on specific search results, this guidance represents a broad approach to troubleshooting the issue within the constraints provided. Each step should be taken with consideration of your specific project context and the technical details of your implementation."
