However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Also, the attempt to directly find uses of the `@classmethod` decorator followed immediately by the `@property` decorator returned no results, suggesting either a potential typo in the search or that these decorators are used in a context that wasn't captured by the direct search string provided.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the original issue mentions that Sphinx does not document methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`, and our initial search queries returned no results, we should broaden our search strategy. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Search for modules or filenames mentioned in the issue instead of class names:**\n   - Since we know the issue originates from a specific repository (`randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo`), looking for specific file names mentioned (`dummy_module.submodule`) might offer some insight. For instance, if we know the file structure from the issue or the repository description, we could directly search within those files.\n   \n2. **Generalized search for documentation strings and Sphinx configurations:**\n   - Since the issue is with Sphinx documentation, searching for Sphinx configuration files (`conf.py`) or annotations could help understand how Sphinx is set to autodocument the codebase. However, without direct access to content from the repository, we can only hypothesize this step.\n\nGiven the inability to directly query external repositories and the generic nature of API search results (interpreted as abstracted functions within this scenario), let's broaden the search with hypothetical yet logically consistent API calls:\n\n- **Search for potential Sphinx configuration or related files:**\n  - `search_file(\"conf.py\")`: To locate the Sphinx configuration file and understand how autodoc is configured.\n  \n- **Broaden the search to find where decorators are applied:**\n  - Since a direct search for `@classmethod` followed by `@property` yielded no results, consider breaking down the search to either decorator to find how they are individually used:\n    - `search_code(\"@classmethod\")`\n    - `search_code(\"@property\")`\n    \n- **Search for the module and submodule mentioned in the reproduction steps:**\n  - Given that the issue reproduction steps involve navigating to `dummy_module.submodule`, a closer look into these might help:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"dummy_module.submodule\", \"dummy_module/submodule.py\")`: Assuming a direct mapping from module name to file path, which might involve searching for the documentation block or specific decorator usage in this context.\n\nNote: The suggestions involve hypothetical file names and structures based on the information from the issue and standard Python project organization principles. Without direct matches from the initial queries, these hypothetical steps are designed to broaden the search scope in a manner that aligns with common debugging and code investigation practices."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since the actual source code or specific details such as file paths and method implementations were not provided in the search results, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact bug locations or suggest the intended behavior to resolve the issue accurately. However, based on the description of the problem in the issue, we can hypothesize a general approach to address the issue:\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Location and Intended Behavior:\n\n#### Bug Location:\n- **File:** (Assumed) `dummy_module/submodule.py` or similar files where classes are defined with methods decorated by both `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n- **Classes:** `MetaClass`, `BaseClass`, `SubClass` or any class that attempts to use `@classmethod` decorator together with `@property` decorator.\n- **Methods:** Methods that were intended to be documented but were not, such as `metaclass_class_property`, `baseclass_class_property`, `subclass_class_property`, and their respective abstract counterparts.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nThe intended behavior would be to ensure that methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` are correctly recognized and documented by Sphinx. Since the issue pointed out that Sphinx fails to document these methods due to the way Python treats combined `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators, the resolution would likely involve adjusting how these combined decorators are implemented or how Sphinx is configured to recognize and document such methods.\n\nA potential solution could involve creating a custom descriptor or modifying Sphinx configurations to ensure that it correctly introspects and documents methods decorated in this manner. This would involve ensuring that the combined use of these decorators does not obscure the method's docstring from Sphinx during the documentation generation process.\n\nWithout specific source code or error messages from Sphinx, suggesting an exact code change is speculative. However, ensuring that Sphinx can access the docstring and recognize the method as a class property would be the goal. This might involve verifying compatibility issues noted with Python versions (as mentioned, Python 3.10 was expected to introduce changes that could affect this behavior) and ensuring Sphinx is adequately configured to utilize these python enhancements.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, developers working on this would need to review how Sphinx's autodoc extension interacts with Python's descriptor protocol, especially in cases where decorators are used in combination, to formulate an effective patch."

These searches aim to cast a wider net, possibly catching relevant configurations or usage patterns indirectly related to the problematic decorators and documentation issues.\n\n### Constructed Search API Calls for More Context\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx Configuration:**\n   - As documentation generation issues are involved, locating the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) might provide insights into how documentation is set up, including any custom settings for autodoc or extensions that could affect the behavior of documenting class methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n   ```python\n   search_file(\"conf.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Broaden the Search for Decorator Usage:**\n   - Since direct searches for combined use of `@classmethod` and `@property` returned no results, it may help to look for these decorators used individually, which could lead to discovering the relevant class definitions by following the trail from there. This two-step approach may circumvent the fact that direct combo searches failed.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"@classmethod\")\n   search_code(\"@property\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Look for Documentation Strings:**\n   - Finding how docstrings are written and placed in the code can give clues to whether there's a specific pattern or unusual structure that Sphinx might not handle well. This might indirectly lead to discovering the areas where the documented entities work as expected versus where they fail.\n   ```python\n   search_code('\"\"\"')\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for Explicit References to the Metaclasses:**\n   - Given that metaclasses were mentioned but not found, searching for any explicit instantiation or reference to metaclass behavior might reveal how they are utilized, potentially unearthing the connected problematic documentation aspects.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"class Meta:\")\n   ```\n\nThe goal of these additional API calls is to gather more context indirectly related to the issue, hoping to piece together how Sphinx's documentation process is integrated with the Python codebase in question, and identifying potential mismatches or overlooked configurations that lead to the observed issue."
