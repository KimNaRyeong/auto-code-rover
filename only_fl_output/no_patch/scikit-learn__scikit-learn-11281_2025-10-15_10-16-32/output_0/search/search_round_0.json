They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n</issue>"

Here are the specific API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. **Search for mixture model classes**: First, we need to understand which classes are considered as mixture models in the project. Since the issue does not specify exact class names, I will search for a broad term that should cover them.\n   - `search_class(\"MixtureModel\")`\n\n2. **Search for clusterer classes**: Similarly, getting a sense of the current clusterer classes will help in comparing their interfaces with mixture models.\n   - `search_class(\"Clusterer\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `n_components` parameter**: This is to understand how the `n_components` parameter is currently being used in mixture models, which should be similar to `n_clusters` in clusterers.\n   - `search_code(\"n_components\")`\n\n4. **Search for `labels_` attribute**: Since mixture models do not store the `labels_` of the training data like clusterers, I want to find where in clusterers this attribute is set.\n   - `search_code(\"labels_\")`\n\n5. **Search for `fit_predict` method in clusterers**: To analyze the current implementation of the `fit_predict` method in clusterer classes, which is missing in mixture models.\n   - `search_method(\"fit_predict\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to address the issue by comparing the current state of mixture models and clusterers in the project."
