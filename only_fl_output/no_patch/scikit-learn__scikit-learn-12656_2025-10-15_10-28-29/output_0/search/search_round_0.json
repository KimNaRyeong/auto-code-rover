        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the hamming_loss function, we need to locate this function within the project's codebase and examine its current implementation and usage. Here are the appropriate API calls based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. **Find the Implementation of `hamming_loss`:** Since the `hamming_loss` function is the focal point of the issue, the first step is to locate its implementation.\n    - `search_method(\"hamming_loss\")`: This call will help identify which files and classes (if it's part of a class) contain the `hamming_loss` function.\n\n2. **Examine the Implementation Details:** After identifying where `hamming_loss` is defined, it's essential to look at its implementation details, especially how `labels` parameter is used and how it's proposed to change `len(labels)` to `y_true.shape[1]`.\n    - No direct API call here until the location from step 1 is identified, but we aim to use `search_code_in_file` or `get_code_around_line` next, based on the results of the first call. \n\n3. **Check for Usage of `hamming_loss` Across the Project:** Understanding how `hamming_loss` is used throughout the project can provide insights into potential impacts of removing the `labels` parameter.\n    - `search_code(\"hamming_loss\")`: This call helps to find instances where `hamming_loss` is called, which can give us an idea about how often and in what context the `labels` parameter is used.\n\nThese steps are sequential; depending on the results of the first API call, the next steps might adjust accordingly. Let's start with the first search to locate the `hamming_loss` function."
