        "intended_behavior": "The `construct` method should ensure that after coarsening and reconstructing the dataset, all variables that were coordinates (both dimensional and non-dimensional) before the coarsening operation retain their status as coordinates. This involves preserving the semantic model of the dataset, where key metadata and alignment properties defined by coordinates remain intact. Specifically:\n\n- Before applying the coarsening transformation, the method needs to identify and record which variables are designated as non-dimensional coordinates.\n\n- Post-transformation, as the new `Dataset` or `DataArray` is being constructed, these identified coordinates should be explicitly reassigned their coordinate status, ensuring that they are not demoted to mere variables. This might involve adjusting how the `set_coords` method is utilized or modifying the logic that determines which variables are tagged as coordinates in the output.\n\n- This preservation of coordinates must be carefully integrated to not disrupt the primary functionality of the `construct` method, which is to reshape and coarsen the dataset. The update should maintain all existing capabilities of the method while correcting the oversight related to coordinate handling."
