        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the make_debug_cursor method to ensure that logging output includes the database alias. This can be done by modifying how the debug cursor logs queries, such as prefixing log entries with the alias information. The database alias is available as self.alias within the BaseDatabaseWrapper class. The modification should allow developers to easily identify which database a logged query is associated with, without altering the existing log structure or information provided in debug logs."

        "intended_behavior": "If logging is performed within execute_wrapper or it is part of the execution flow where logging occurs, ensure the database alias is included in the context that is passed to logging calls within this wrapper. As this context manager could be handling or surrounding query execution, it's a strategic point to include additional details such as the database alias in log messages. This ensures that any logging that happens in the context of query execution is clearly marked with the alias, helping in the identification of the source database for the operations logged."
