This Python script checks if markers created with mathtext are center-aligned compared to standard markers by matplotlib. If the mathtext markers are not properly centered (with a given threshold for possible small rendering differences), an `AssertionError` is raised, and a stack trace is printed showing where the issue occurred. Adjust the threshold as necessary depending on the sensitivity of the alignment check needed. Remember, actual rendering may vary slightly based on environment and rendering engine, which means minor differences could be normal.
