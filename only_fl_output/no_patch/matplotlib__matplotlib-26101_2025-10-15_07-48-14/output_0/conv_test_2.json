It also prepares the script for a visual comparison since exact positioning can be tricky to validate programmatically without considering specifics of text rendering which might involve bounding box positioning and font metrics. This means that while the script checks for the presence of paths for standard markers correctly, assessing the alignment of mathtext markers against standard markers is left with a caution to manually inspect through the displayed plot due to the complexities of automated comparison in this context."
