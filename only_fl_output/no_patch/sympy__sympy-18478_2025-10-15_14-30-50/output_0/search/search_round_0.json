The behavior described suggests a discrepancy in how these cases are processed. We should explore:\n\n1. The implementation of the `.subs` method, which is probably part of a base class for symbolic expressions.\n2. The classes representing symbolic constants and functions, specifically for `oo` (infinity), `cos`, and `exp`, to understand how their limits or evaluations at infinity are defined.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method(\"subs\")`: To locate the implementation of the `.subs` method within the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"Add\")`: Since the issue involves addition (`x+cos(x)` and `exp(x)+cos(x)`), understanding how the `Add` class handles operations might provide insights.\n- `search_class(\"Mul\")`: As multiplication might be involved indirectly through expressions like `exp(x)`, which implicates exponential growth rate semantics in the context of infinity.\n- `search_class(\"Infinity\")`: To gain insight into how infinity (`oo`) is represented and handled within the project.\n- `search_class(\"Cos\")`: To investigate the representation and evaluation of the cosine function, especially at infinity.\n- `search_class(\"Exp\")`: Similarly, to look into how the exponential function is implemented and behaves at infinity."
