This method will handle asynchronous requests for static files, similar to how `get_response` handles synchronous requests. It should asynchronously process a request passed to it, and return an appropriate HTTP response for the requested static file. This method needs to integrate well with Django's ASGI infrastructure, ensuring that it can properly receive a request object and engage with the Django application's async lifecycle. The implementation should carefully manage async file reading and respect Django's settings for static files, such as headers, caching policies, and file location resolution. This resolves the issue by providing the missing async handling capability required for ASGI environments, thus eliminating the `'NoneType' object is not callable` exception being raised due to the absence of this method."

            "intended_behavior": "While the addition of `get_response_async` directly to `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` addresses the immediate issue, considering the application design and reusability, it might be evaluated whether to incorporate async methods like `get_response_async` into this mixin instead, assuming other handlers could benefit from shared async static files serving logic. This would involve not only implementing `get_response_async` but also ensuring any other necessary async support methods are present. This suggestion is contingent on the broader use case and design intentions of the Django project regarding asynchronous static file handling. Adding `get_response_async` to `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` or potentially `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` resolves the issue by providing the needed asynchronous handling method that's expected to be called in an ASGI environment, thereby preserving the functionality and extending it to support async processing of static file requests."
