I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

The issue revolves around `GridSearchCV`, specifically its behavior when `n_jobs = 1`. Therefore, it's essential to find where `GridSearchCV` is defined in the codebase. I'll start by searching for the `GridSearchCV` class.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that `cv_results_['params']` and all `cv_results_['param_*']` objects contain fitted estimators, particularly concerning memory usage when these are dumped, I need to find where `cv_results_` is populated. I'll search for methods within `GridSearchCV` that deal with updating or assigning values to `cv_results_`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"cv_results_\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n3. The user suspects that the bug occurs because the estimators are not cloned before use. Cloning of estimators is a common practice in scikit-learn to ensure that the original estimators passed to grid search are not modified during the fitting process. Therefore, it is crucial to find where and how estimators are cloned within the `GridSearchCV` process. I'll search for the usage of the `clone` function or method within the context of `GridSearchCV`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"clone\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n4. It's also valuable to understand how the `fit` method of `GridSearchCV` operates since the fitting process involves the estimators that the issue points out. By examining the `fit` method, we can better understand how estimators are handled during the grid search.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive code context around the handling of estimators within `GridSearchCV`, specifically related to cloning, memory usage, and the population of `cv_results_`. This information will be pivotal in crafting a solution."

        "content": "Analyzing the context provided and taking into account the inability to find direct results for the `cv_results_`, `clone`, and `fit` methods within `GridSearchCV` points us towards needing to adjust our approach to extract the needed information effectively. Here\u2019s a refined strategy based on the initial attempt and the feedback provided:\n\n### 1. **Location of `GridSearchCV`**:\nWe have identified that `GridSearchCV` is defined within `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`. This gives us a starting point and confirms that we're looking in the right module for our investigation.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analytical Questions:\n\nGiven the results and the lack of direct hits for our specific search queries, let's consider alternative approaches to navigate through the codebase more effectively.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `GridSearchCV` class is a core component in scikit-learn for performing hyperparameter optimization. It systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe bug specifically relates to the handling of fitted estimators during the grid search process, especially regarding how they are stored or cloned within the `GridSearchCV` implementation.\n\n#### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nIdeally, `GridSearchCV` should handle parameter grids in such a way that fitted estimators are either not stored directly within `cv_results_` or are stored in a manner that does not consume excessive memory, particularly for the case where `n_jobs = 1`. Moreover, it's critical that the process ensures estimators are cloned before fitting, to avoid any side effects on the original estimators provided by the user.\n\n### Adjusted Search Strategy:\n\n1. **Examine `fit` Implementation**: Since direct searches for the `fit` method in `GridSearchCV` did not return results, consider broadening the search criteria by examining the `_search.py` file directly for any references to `fit`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for `clone` Usage Globally**: Given that a search for `clone` within `GridSearchCV` didn't yield results, it might be beneficial to understand how `clone` is generally used within the `model_selection` module, potentially affecting `GridSearchCV`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"clone\")\n```\n\n3. **Investigate `cv_results_` Assignment**: The direct search for `cv_results_` might not have been successful because it\u2019s likely not a method but a variable that gets updated throughout the fitting process. We know the class file now, so a more targeted search within that file for any assignments or updates to `cv_results_` could prove useful.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"cv_results_ =\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\nThis adjusted search strategy should provide more insights into how `GridSearchCV` handles estimators and populates `cv_results_` during its operation, which is crucial for addressing the memory issue described in the bug report."

This would prevent unnecessary memory use and ensure that `cv_results_` only stores unfitted estimators or, preferably, their parameters rather than fitted instances. Cloning should be employed consistently to preserve the original state of passed estimators, maintaining functionality while preventing side effects on memory and disk usage when dumping `cv_results_`. The implementation needs to verify if deep cloning of estimator parameters is performed when these are set in the param grid, ensuring that the state of these objects post-fit does not affect the dumped results. This would likely involve inspecting and possibly adjusting the internal logic of parameter handling and result logging within the grid search process, specifically tailored to handle cases where `n_jobs = 1`.\n\nThis interpretation assumes the cloning mechanism and parameter handling within grid search operations are central to resolving the issue, based on the common practices within scikit-learn's approach to estimator handling and hyperparameter tuning."
