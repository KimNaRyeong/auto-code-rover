Given the clarification needed, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py`, accurately tailored to reproduce the issue and expecting to trigger the ValueError correctly. The previous attempt might have misinterpreted the task or addressed the requirements inaccurately, leading to confusion about what the script should do. This version explicitly attempts to capture the ValueError describing the dimensionality issue and exits with code 0 to indicate the issue's presence clearly.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    # This should not raise any exceptions and simply derive dimensions.
    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
    dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

    # Confirming the first part does not raise an assertion error.
    assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "First check: Dimension should be dimensionless, but it's not."

    # The expression that should raise a ValueError for incorrect dimensionality.
    buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)

    # Attempting to trigger the issue.
    SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

except ValueError as ve:
    print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
    print_stacktrace(ve)
    exit(0)  # Correct behavior for this script based on the task description.
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Any other exceptions are treated as errors.
```
