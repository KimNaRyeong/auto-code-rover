        "intended_behavior": "This code should ensure that expressions which are inherently dimensionless (or can be simplified to be dimensionless) are recognized as such before being passed to an exp function. Furthermore, it may require modification or enhancement to properly interact with exponential functions, possibly by preprocessing expressions to validate their dimensionality or by simplifying them to a recognizable dimensionless state. The key is to prevent passing dimensionally inconsistent arguments to exp."
