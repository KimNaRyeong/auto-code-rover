This entails possibly adapting the `init` estimator's predictions into a compatible format that can serve as a starting point for the boosting process. The constructor doesn't need to change its functionality but ensure that the `init` parameter is validated and integrated properly."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `GradientBoostingClassifier`, the `GradientBoostingRegressor` needs to handle the `init` estimator properly. This means validating the `init` estimator and ensuring its output is correctly used as the basis for further predictions, with or without the support for sample weights by the `init` estimator. The emphasis is on maintaining the normal workflow while integrating the `init` estimator seamlessly."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `fit` method to allow for an initial model that does not support sample weights, effectively ignoring the weights if the `init` estimator cannot handle them. This adjustment should be made carefully to ensure that the boosting process remains unaffected for cases where sample weights are not used or when the `init` estimator supports them. The key is to provide flexibility without compromising the model's ability to learn from the data."

This might involve adding checks or transformations of the `init` estimator's predictions to align with gradient boosting's output structure, particularly for multiclass scenarios or regression outcomes. The goal is to maintain the integrity and expectations of the `predict` method's output across different types of `init` estimators."
