        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Function` method's intended behavior should include recognizing `acsc` and `asec` as part of the inverse trigonometric functions set that can be printed in full names when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified. This means extending the `inv_trig_table` list on line 743 to include `\"acsc\"` and `\"asec\"`, making it `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\", \"acsc\", \"asec\"]`. This modification will ensure that when `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` or `latex(asec(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` is called, the output will be `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` and `\\\\arcsec{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` respectively, aligning with the full name printing style of other inverse trigonometric functions. This update preserves the existing functionality, allowing both the abbreviated and full styles to be accurately applied to all relevant functions, thereby fixing the issue described."
