The intended behavior here is to ensure that the queryset handed over to delete_queryset can be safely deleted, possibly by re-evaluating the queryset without distinct() if it's not compatible with deletion. This adjustment must preserve the admin's ability to filter and search efficiently without causing errors during bulk delete actions."

        "intended_behavior": "The code handling search queries in the admin page that involves many-to-many fields (directly or indirectly) needs to ensure that the operations following a search, such as delete, do not fail because of intermediate query modifications like distinct(). Here, the solution might involve reworking how search querysets are prepared or offering an alternative path for delete actions that does not rely on potentially modified querysets containing distinct(). This ensures the admin interface remains robust, supporting both complex searches and bulk actions without leading to exceptions."
