Given the constraints and goals outlined, here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the described Django admin issue. This script will attempt to mimic the condition that leads to an internal server error when a delete action is performed on objects that were filtered using a `ManyToMany` field in the Django admin. Note that to run this script successfully, you must have Django installed in your environment.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Setup minimal Django settings

    django.setup()
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '__main__'

    email = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(User)


# Register models in admin
@admin.register(Post)

    search_fields = ('title', 'authors__email')

    admin.autodiscover()

    argv = ['manage.py', 'makemigrations', '__main__', 'user', 'post']
    execute_from_command_line(argv)

        posts_to_delete = Post.objects.filter(title__icontains='Test')
        posts_to_delete.delete()
        # The issue would occur here and an AssertionError should not be raised if it exists
        raise AssertionError("The script did not encounter the expected error.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)

```

This script operates by first setting up a minimal Django environment where it defines two models (`User` and `Post`) with a `ManyToMany` relationship. The `Post` model is registered in Django's admin with a search field involving a related `User` model via its `email` attribute. It then attempts to simulate the described issue by performing a delete operation on the `Post` objects filtered by the title, which should, according to the issue description, lead to a `TypeError` due to calling `delete()` after a `distinct()` call implicitly made by Django's admin search mechanism. The `print_stacktrace` function captures and prints the stack trace for any exception encountered during this process, aiming to verify the reproduction of the issue.
