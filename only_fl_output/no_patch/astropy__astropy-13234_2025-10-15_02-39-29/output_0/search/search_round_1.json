It then reconstructs columns that may have been serialized into a more complex structure back into their original mixin columns (e.g., Quantity, Time) format, leveraging the structure defined in the metadata. It determines the output class based on whether any of the reconstructed columns is a quantity subclass.\n\n   - `_construct_mixin_from_columns`: This method is used by `_construct_mixins_from_columns` to handle each new name (column) and its attributes within the serialized columns metadata. It processes serialized columns, mapping their 'name' attributes back to the original column names, and handles nested serialized columns recursively. The method also manipulates the output table to replace the placeholder columns with the reconstructed mixin columns.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   \n   The bug appears in the process of handling a structured column serialization and deserialization, particularly with a field named `name`. The error message `TypeError: unhashable type: 'SerializedColumn'` suggests that the bug is related to how column names are handled during this reconstruction process. Specifically, the issue arises in `_construct_mixin_from_columns`, where `data_attrs_map[val['name']] = name` fails because `val['name']` is expected to be a hashable key (typically a string), but a `SerializedColumn` object is being used instead.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   \n   - The intended behavior for `_construct_mixins_from_columns` is to seamlessly convert serialized column data back into a table with appropriate mixin columns, without losing any information or structure, including special handling for fields with potentially conflicting names like `name`.\n\n   - For `_construct_mixin_from_columns`, the intended behavior is to correctly map serialized column metadata back to actual column objects, handling both simple cases and nested serialized columns correctly and efficiently. In the case of the issue, this process should work even if one of the fields is ambiguously named `name`, which is also used as a key within the serialized representation.\n\nGiven the detailed issue description and the traceback pointing to `_construct_mixin_from_columns`, we can surmise that the bug fix may involve ensuring that all keys used in the `data_attrs_map` are of a hashable type (like string representations), and that the special case where a column's data attribute is exactly 'name' needs to be handled without ambiguity. \n\nWe may need to either add a conditional check within `_construct_mixin_from_columns` to handle the case where `val['name']` is not hashable or ensure that all instances of SerializedColumn objects are treated correctly when their 'name' attribute is being accessed or used as a dictionary key.\n\nTo further refine the solution, analyzing how `SerializedColumn` objects and their 'name' attributes are utilized across the serialization/deserialization processes could provide necessary insights for a robust fix."

Specifically, when `val['name']` is used as a key in `data_attrs_map`, the code should ensure that this operation is only attempted when `val['name']` refers to a simple string value representing the column's name, not a `SerializedColumn` object or any other non-hashable type. \n\n   To resolve the issue, implement a check to ensure that `val['name']` is a string before using it as a key. In cases where `val['name']` might refer to a `SerializedColumn` or has the potential to be non-hashable, the code should handle such situations gracefully, possibly by generating a unique, hashable identifier for the column that does not conflict with internal serialization logic.\n\n   This fix needs to preserve the functionality of reconstructing mixin columns from serialized columns, including handling nested serialized columns correctly. Ensuring that any field name, including 'name', can be serialized and deserialized without causing errors is essential. This might involve additional logic to disambiguate ambiguous field names during the serialization process or additional metadata to handle edge cases."
