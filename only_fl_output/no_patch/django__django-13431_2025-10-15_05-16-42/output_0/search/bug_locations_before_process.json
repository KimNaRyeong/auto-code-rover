        "intended_behavior": "When constructing the SQL query for aggregation, the method should correctly handle and reference annotated fields created in a preceding annotate call. This means ensuring that any aliases used for annotated fields are consistently referenced throughout the query construction process, especially when those annotated fields are utilized in aggregates. The intersection point where the aggregate queries include annotated fields must reference these annotations correctly, avoiding SQL errors like the unknown column issue because of misreferenced aliases. This adjustment ensures that when Django constructs subqueries involving annotations and aggregates, all references to annotated fields are accurate and coherent, preserving the aliasing without leading to resolution errors."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly implicated as faulty, ensuring the annotate method's output is correctly utilized by subsequent aggregate calls is essential. The annotate function should clearly define the scope and aliasing of annotated fields so that these can be understood and handled without ambiguity in subsequent operations, specifically aggregate. The method itself may not require changes, but its interaction with aggregate and the overall SQL construction logic should be verified to ensure annotations are appropriately factored into the aggregate's SQL generation logic. This includes validating the chaining of queryset methods where annotations serve as inputs to aggregates, leading to proper SQL command generation that considers the established aliases."
