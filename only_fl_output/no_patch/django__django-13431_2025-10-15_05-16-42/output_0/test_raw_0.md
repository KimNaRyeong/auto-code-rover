This script setups a minimal Django environment within itself, including an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity. It defines a model `T` and attempts to reproduce the problem SQL query, catching any exception to confirm if the issue described in the ticket occurs.

Please note, the original issue describes behavior with a MySQL database. This script uses SQLite due to its accessibility and ease of setup, especially for a standalone reproducible script. SQLite behavior may differ from MySQL, and in practice, some SQL-related issues may only be replicable with the specific database in question due to differences in SQL dialects and database behavior. 

However, this script follows the intention to provoke a similar situation where an annotated field is used alongside an aggregated function in a way that might cause confusion or error in Django's query generation and handling, simulating the conditions described in the issue as closely as possible within the limitations of a standalone, portable script.
