        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_duration` method needs to be modified to ensure that the sign is correctly applied to durations that only consist of days. To achieve this, the calculation handling the final return value, specifically the line `return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)`, should be adjusted. This adjustment must ensure that the sign is incorporated into the `days` `datetime.timedelta` object before or during its creation, rather than relying on the final combination step, which does not work when `kw` results in a timedelta of zero duration. The change must preserve the existing functionality for all other cases (e.g., durations including hours, minutes, seconds, and/or microseconds, in addition to or instead of days) while correctly handling the sign for durations consisting solely of days. Essentially, the sign should directly influence the `days` timedelta, ensuring negative durations are properly represented even when only days are specified, without altering the method's behavior for parsing other components of the duration string."
