        "intended_behavior": "The method responsible for constructing the query with prefetch_related should be modified to exclude NULL values from the IN clause when processing ForeignKey fields that are not nullable. This adjustment will involve checking the nullability of the ForeignKey field when assembling the list of ids/values to use in the IN clause. If the ForeignKey is non-nullable, NULL values should be omitted from this list. This change ensures that the query efficiency is improved by not including redundant checks for NULL, and it also avoids potential logical errors caused by the special behavior of NULL in SQL."
