        "content": "<issue>Avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup\nDescription\nCurrently prefetch_related on a FK passes the NULL through to the database for e.g. author_id IN (NULL, 2). Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To tackle the issue about avoiding passing `NULL` to the `IN` lookup when prefetching related objects for a ForeignKey (`FK`), where passing `NULL` can lead to unnecessary database queries and potential issues with complex querysets, we need to gather more context about the parts of the codebase where this behavior occurs. Specifically, we should look into the Django model definitions, ForeignKey relationships, and prefetch_related logic. Based on the issue description, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `ForeignKey` class implementation to understand how NULL values are handled in FK relationships.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since Django's `prefetch_related` logic is likely involved, we should look for its implementation to see how NULL values are being passed to the database.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"prefetch_related\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue also suggests exploring the behavior of the `__in` lookup with non-nullable fields. Searching for its implementation or usage might provide insights into how it handles NULL values and FKs.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"__in\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches will help us better understand the parts of Django's ORM that handle ForeignKey relations and the prefetch_related logic, as well as how the `__in` lookup is implemented or used. This information will be crucial for crafting a patch to avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup in the described scenarios."
