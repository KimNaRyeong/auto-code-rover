        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit.

The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "content": "The search results provided crucial insights into the implementation of the `pairwise_distances` function in Scikit-Learn, but also revealed gaps in the search for specific optimization strategies mentioned in the issue description. Let's analyze the given context and consider subsequent steps:\n\n### Analysis of `pairwise_distances` Implementation:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `pairwise_distances` function computes the distance matrix from a vector array `X` and an optional vector array `Y`, using a specified metric. It supports a wide range of metrics, both from Scikit-Learn itself and from `scipy.spatial.distance`. For some metrics like 'euclidean', 'cityblock', and 'cosine', Scikit-Learn's implementation is preferred over SciPy's due to optimizations for speed and sparse matrix support. The function can also handle precomputed distance matrices directly.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - The bug issue is specifically related to the numeric precision of the `euclidean` distance computation using `float32` arrays, where the output from `pairwise_distances` disagrees with NumPy's `np.linalg.norm` method. The `pairwise_distances` function delegates the computation to different implementations based on the nature of the input and the specified metric. For the `euclidean` metric, it employs optimized implementations that might handle `float32` and `float64` data types differently, leading to discrepancies in numeric precision.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Ideally, `pairwise_distances` should provide consistent results with NumPy's distance computations, irrespective of the data types (`float32` or `float64`). The fact that results align for `float64` but not for `float32` indicates a potential precision handling or type conversion issue within the implementation when dealing with lower precision floating-point numbers.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Gaps in Search:\n\n1. **Investigating Specific Optimizations:**\n   - The issue mentions optimizations, including block-wise casting to `float64`, handling additional memory, and manipulating blocks of the distance matrix, which were not found in the search results. Since the direct search for these optimizations returned no results, it might be due to them being described in a more abstract way or implemented differently than literal \"block-wise casting to float64\".\n\n2. **Alternative Search Approaches:**\n   - Considering the optimizations were not directly found, we could look for related functionality that implies such optimizations. This includes looking into where the library handles data types, particularly the conversion between `float32` and `float64`, or memory management aspects during the computation of distances.\n   \n3. **Exploring Related Functions or Utilities:**\n   - The bug might lie in utility functions or preprocessing steps before the actual distance computation occurs in `pairwise_distances`. Since the implementation delegates to `PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS` for known metrics, and there's mentioning of `_precompute_metric_params` and `_parallel_pairwise`, examining these areas can reveal handling of data types or optimizations intended to improve performance or memory usage.\n\n4. **Further API Calls:**\n   - To understand how the data types are handled or converted during the process, we should look more into:\n     - `search_method(\"_precompute_metric_params\")`\n     - `search_method(\"_parallel_pairwise\")`\n     - Alternatively, finding calls to NumPy's `astype` method might reveal explicit casts: `search_code(\"astype\")`\n\nBy framing further inquiries around these points, we aim to uncover the internal workings that could influence the numerical precision of euclidean distances computed for `float32` arrays in Scikit-Learn."

This could involve ensuring any type conversion (to `float64` for intermediate calculations to enhance precision) and subsequent conversion back to `float32`, if done, does not introduce errors or discrepancies as observed. Additionally, if memory optimization techniques like block-wise processing are employed, they must not compromise the accuracy of the distance computations.\n\nWithout specific insights into how Scikit-Learn's optimizations and type handling might lead to the observed discrepancy, these locations and behaviors are speculative and meant to guide further investigation once additional context is acquired."

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the context around the methods `_precompute_metric_params` and `_parallel_pairwise`, as well as the prevalent usage of `astype` in the codebase, to better understand their role and potential influence on the numerical precision issue described.\n\n### Analyzing `_precompute_metric_params`:\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: This function precomputes parameters that are derived from data and required for metric computation, specifically for \"seuclidean\" and \"mahalanobis\" metrics at this moment. These parameters ('V' for \"seuclidean\" variance and 'VI' for the inverse of \"mahalanobis\" covariance) are only computed if not already provided in the keyword arguments.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: This specific function does not directly address the numerical precision issue with `float32` arrays for the \"euclidean\" distance, as it deals with different metrics. However, the concept of precomputing certain parameters based on input data types (and potentially converting or handling these types with precision consideration) is relevant for addressing the precision issue.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Although not directly related to fixing the bug, a similar approach could be considered for the \"euclidean\" distance where checks or conversions might be necessary to maintain numerical precision, especially for `float32` data.\n\n### Analyzing `_parallel_pairwise`:\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: The function is designed to break down the pairwise distance computation into manageable parts that can be processed in parallel, effectively utilizing available computational resources to speed up the operation on large datasets.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: While this function outlines the framework for parallel computation of distances, the actual computation depends on the `func` argument passed, which determines how distances are calculated. The numerical precision issue may stem from how the data and computations are divided and then aggregated, particularly if there are data type conversions or approximations involved in this process for efficiency.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: To ensure numerical precision, especially for operations involving `float32` data, any data type conversions or intermediate computations that may lead to precision loss should carefully preserve or enhance the precision wherever possible. If `func` performs operations that compromise `float32` precision, then ensuring consistency with NumPy's `np.linalg.norm` for `float32` inputs would be necessary.\n\n### Common Uses of `astype`:\n\n1. **Function Purpose**: The `astype` method is widely used across the Scikit-Learn codebase to convert the data type of NumPy arrays. This is a common practice when ensuring the data meets the requirements of various computations or algorithms.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The use of `astype` can directly impact numerical precision. If arrays of `float32` are being converted to `float64` for computation and then perhaps back to `float32`, this could introduce discrepancies if not handled correctly, especially in operations sensitive to precision like distance calculations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Where `astype` is used in the computation of euclidean distances or in any preparatory steps, it should ensure that the conversion does not lead to a loss of precision or discrepancies with expected outcomes, particularly when comparing different implementations that should theoretically yield identical results (e.g., Scikit-Learn's `pairwise_distances` and NumPy's `np.linalg.norm`).\n\n### Summary:\n\nWhile `_precompute_metric_params` and `_parallel_pairwise` do not directly influence the numerical precision issue for `euclidean` distances computed with `float32`, they provide insight into how Scikit-Learn handles computations that could affect precision. The widespread use of `astype` underscores the need for careful data type management to preserve accuracy. Addressing the precision issue might therefore involve ensuring that any type conversion or computation preserves the integrity of `float32` calculations throughout the process, potentially through a targeted approach in how distances are calculated or through a review of any data type conversion practices involved in those calculations."

        "content": "Based on the analysis and the information gathered from the API calls, it is clear that the issue with numerical precision in the computation of euclidean distances for `float32` arrays in `pairwise_distances` likely stems from how data types are handled during computation. Therefore, a need for additional context is not immediate for identifying potential bug locations and proposing solutions.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n#### Location 1:\n- **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n- **Method:** `pairwise_distances`\n  \n**Intended Behavior:** This method should ensure numerical precision is maintained when computing euclidean distances, especially for `float32` arrays. This could involve adding a mechanism to detect when inputs are of type `float32` and ensuring that any internal type conversions (potentially to `float64` for intermediate precision) do not negatively impact the final distance calculation. Furthermore, the method should compare or align results closely with NumPy's `np.linalg.norm` outputs for both `float32` and `float64` data types, reducing discrepancies to a minimum. Explicit tests could be implemented to verify that the precision remains intact for these operations, specifically targeting scenarios described in the issue.\n\n#### Location 2:\n- **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n- **Method:** `_precompute_metric_params`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** While this method doesn't directly relate to the `euclidean` metric computation, ensuring any adjustments or additions to this and related methods that precompute parameters consider numerical precision for all supported metrics could preemptively address similar precision concerns. Specifically, when adding support for new metrics or modifying existing ones, careful consideration of how `float32` and `float64` types are treated can avoid similar issues, ensuring that optimizations or computational shortcuts do not introduce precision discrepancies.\n\nThese adjustments should be executed with an understanding that existing functionality for computations using `float64` data (and other data types) remains unaffected, ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining the library\u2019s robustness for diverse application needs. Automated testing should be employed to confirm that these changes achieve the desired outcome without unintended side effects, particularly in terms of numerical precision and performance implications.\n"
