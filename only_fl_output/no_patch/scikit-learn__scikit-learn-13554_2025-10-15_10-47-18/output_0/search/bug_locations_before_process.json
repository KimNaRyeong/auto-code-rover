        "method": "pairwise_distances",
        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure numerical precision is maintained when computing euclidean distances, especially for float32 arrays. This could involve adding a mechanism to detect when inputs are of type float32 and ensuring that any internal type conversions (potentially to float64 for intermediate precision) do not negatively impact the final distance calculation. Furthermore, the method should compare or align results closely with NumPy's np.linalg.norm outputs for both float32 and float64 data types, reducing discrepancies to a minimum. Explicit tests could be implemented to verify that the precision remains intact for these operations, specifically targeting scenarios described in the issue."

        "intended_behavior": "While this method doesn't directly relate to the euclidean metric computation, ensuring any adjustments or additions to this and related methods that precompute parameters consider numerical precision for all supported metrics could preemptively address similar precision concerns. Specifically, when adding support for new metrics or modifying existing ones, careful consideration of how float32 and float64 types are treated can avoid similar issues, ensuring that optimizations or computational shortcuts do not introduce precision discrepancies."
