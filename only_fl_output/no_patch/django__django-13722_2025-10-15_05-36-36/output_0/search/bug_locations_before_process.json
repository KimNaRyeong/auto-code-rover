        "intended_behavior": "We aim to introduce a new method within the `InlineModelAdmin` class, let's call it `get_formset_initial_data`. This method will serve as a hook for developers to customize initial data for inline formsets in a way similar to the existing methods that customize formset creation, such as `get_formset`. The method should accept parameters like `request` and `obj`, mirroring `get_formset` but focused on providing initial data for the formset. This data then should be injected into the formset creation process within `get_formset`. The method itself doesn't need to follow a complex structure; even a simple base version that developers can override would be sufficient. It should return a structured object that's compatible with the inline formset's expected initial data format, possibly leveraging the formset\u2019s own mechanisms for handling initial data. This approach will allow developers to inject context-sensitive initial data into inline formsets without disrupting the existing infrastructure."
