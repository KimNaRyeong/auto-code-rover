        "content": "<issue>Add support for adding non-key columns to indexes\nDescription\n(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\nPostgres got support for the INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context about how the current index creation and unique constraints are handled in the codebase, particularly focusing on Django since the issue description suggests modifications to Django's `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` functionalities to support the `INCLUDE` clause in index creation for PostgreSQL (and potentially other databases). Here are the search API calls that would be pertinent to collect the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the Index Class**: It's essential to understand how the current `Index` class is implemented to add the `include` kwarg.\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. **Search for the UniqueConstraint Class**: Since the feature should also be applied to `UniqueConstraint`, understanding its current structure is vital.\n   - `search_class(\"UniqueConstraint\")`\n\n3. **Search for Methods in BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor**: Given that the feature should not be PostgreSQL-specific and the suggestion to expose the functionality on `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, we need insights into the current methods of this class related to index handling.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"add_index\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"add_constraint\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n4. **Search for Existing \"include\" Implementations**: To ensure we are not duplicating functionality or to see if there is any groundwork already laid for such a feature, it's practical to search if the term \"include\" is already in use within the context of indexes or constraints.\n   - `search_code(\"include\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a thorough understanding of the current implementation of indexes, constraints, and how database schema modifications are handled. This information is crucial for designing a solution that integrates seamlessly with existing functionalities and supports the new `INCLUDE` feature for indexes in Django."
