        "intended_behavior": "The `Index` class should be extended to accept an additional `include` parameter in its constructor (`__init__` method) to specify non-key columns that should be included in the index. The `create_sql` method needs to be updated to generate SQL that includes these columns in the `INCLUDE` clause of the `CREATE INDEX` statement for databases that support this feature, notably PostgreSQL. This addition must not alter the core functionality for databases that do not support the `INCLUDE` clause."

        "intended_behavior": "While the class itself may not require modification to its existing methods (`add_index` and `add_constraint`), there's a need to ensure that the implementation of these methods (and possibly others related to schema editing) supports the enhanced functionality of the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes. Specifically, the database schema editor should be capable of executing the new SQL statements that include the `INCLUDE` clause. This may involve adding checks to ensure compatibility with the database backend being used and potentially handling any exceptions for unsupported cases in a manner that's transparent to the user."
