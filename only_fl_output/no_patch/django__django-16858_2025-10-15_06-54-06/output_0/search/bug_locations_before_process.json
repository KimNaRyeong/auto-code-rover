        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to include a call to `self.get_prep_value(value)` before the value handling and processing steps. This will ensure that any custom logic within `get_prep_value` is executed, allowing custom `JSONField` implementations to prepare their data correctly before it is passed to the database. The call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value` should use the result of `self.get_prep_value(value)` instead of `value` directly. This adjustment must preserve the method's existing functionality, such as handling instances of `expressions.Value` and objects with an `as_sql` method, while also including the prepared value in these processes. The change must be backward-compatible, ensuring that existing implementations that do not override `get_prep_value` are not affected negatively."
