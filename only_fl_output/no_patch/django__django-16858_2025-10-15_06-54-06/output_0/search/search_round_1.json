        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the mentioned issue, we first need to gather more context about where and how `JSONField` and its methods are implemented and used in Django 4.2. Specifically, we should look at the implementations of `JSONField.get_db_prep_value()` and `JSONField.get_prep_value()`, as well as any usage of `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`. Moreover, inspecting any documentation or comments related to these might provide additional insights into whether the change was intentional and if it's documented. Here are the API calls we can use to gather this information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find the `JSONField` class within Django's codebase to explore its implementation further.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_db_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`: To get the current implementation details of `get_db_prep_value` in the `JSONField` class, which is central to the issue reported.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"get_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`: To understand how `get_prep_value` is currently implemented or used within the `JSONField` class, as its behavior seems to have changed.\n4. `search_code(\"connection.ops.adapt_json_value\")`: Since the suggested fix involves `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`, we need to explore how and where this is being used in relation to `JSONField`.\n\nThese calls should provide a foundational understanding of the issue and potential starting points for a resolution."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals significant details about how `JSONField` and its methods are implemented in Django 4.2, particularly in regards to the bug concerning `get_prep_value` not being called for `JSONField`.\n\n1. **`django/db/models/fields/json.py` Implementation of `JSONField`:**\n   - This file contains the `JSONField` class which is a subclass of `CheckFieldDefaultMixin` and `Field`. It's designed to handle JSON data, with methods to prepare and manipulate this data for database operations.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This class is central to the issue as it contains the `get_db_prep_value` method, which is supposed to prepare a value for insertion into the database but no longer calls `get_prep_value` as outlined by the issue.\n\n2. **Implementation of `get_db_prep_value` method:**\n   - The `get_db_prep_value` method is responsible for preparing a value for the database. If the value is an instance of `expressions.Value`, it tries to load it as JSON; if not, it simply passes the value to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value` along with an encoder if applicable.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This method is directly related to the issue because, from the given description and the code snippet, it does not invoke `get_prep_value` at any point. Instead, it directly manipulates the value or passes it to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`, which suggests the reported behavior.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Based on the issue description, the intended behavior of `get_db_prep_value` in the context of `JSONField` should include a call to `get_prep_value` to allow custom JSONField implementations to properly prepare their value before database interaction. This provides a standardized way to manipulate values across different field types and aligns with the documented approach to custom fields in Django.\n\n4. **Absence of `get_prep_value` implementation:**\n   - The fact that `get_prep_value` was not found in the class indicates that by default, `JSONField` may not provide an override for this method or relies on inherited behavior. This absence contributes to the issue, as custom implementations of `JSONField` that rely on `get_prep_value` for data preparation are not called as part of the database preparation process.\n\nGiven this context, to resolve the bug, the code of `JSONField.get_db_prep_value` should ideally be modified to include a call to `self.get_prep_value(value)`, ensuring that any custom logic defined in `get_prep_value` is executed as part of the value preparation for the database. Moreover, since this change in behavior from Django 4.1 to 4.2 was not documented as a backward incompatible change or explicitly mentioned in the release notes, there's a substantial gap in communication to developers relying on this functionality.\n\nIn order to proceed effectively with making these adjustments or recommendations, a further search for any discussions or documentation around the intentional exclusion of `get_prep_value` from `JSONField` might be necessary, as it could inform the best approach to resolving the issue while maintaining the integrity and design principles of Django's model field system."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This will ensure that any custom logic within `get_prep_value` is executed, allowing custom `JSONField` implementations to prepare their data correctly before it is passed to the database. The call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value` should use the result of `self.get_prep_value(value)` instead of `value` directly. \n     This adjustment must preserve the method's existing functionality, such as handling instances of `expressions.Value` and objects with an `as_sql` method, while also including the prepared value in these processes. The change must be backward-compatible, ensuring that existing implementations that do not override `get_prep_value` are not affected negatively.\n\nThis will repair the disconnect introduced in Django 4.2, where `get_prep_value` is no longer called for `JSONField`, aligning it back with the documented behavior and expectations around custom field implementations in Django."
