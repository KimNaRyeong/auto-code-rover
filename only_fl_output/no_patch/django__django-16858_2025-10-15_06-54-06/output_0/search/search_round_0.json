        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the mentioned issue, we first need to gather more context about where and how `JSONField` and its methods are implemented and used in Django 4.2. Specifically, we should look at the implementations of `JSONField.get_db_prep_value()` and `JSONField.get_prep_value()`, as well as any usage of `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`. Moreover, inspecting any documentation or comments related to these might provide additional insights into whether the change was intentional and if it's documented. Here are the API calls we can use to gather this information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find the `JSONField` class within Django's codebase to explore its implementation further.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"get_db_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`: To get the current implementation details of `get_db_prep_value` in the `JSONField` class, which is central to the issue reported.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"get_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`: To understand how `get_prep_value` is currently implemented or used within the `JSONField` class, as its behavior seems to have changed.\n4. `search_code(\"connection.ops.adapt_json_value\")`: Since the suggested fix involves `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`, we need to explore how and where this is being used in relation to `JSONField`.\n\nThese calls should provide a foundational understanding of the issue and potential starting points for a resolution."
