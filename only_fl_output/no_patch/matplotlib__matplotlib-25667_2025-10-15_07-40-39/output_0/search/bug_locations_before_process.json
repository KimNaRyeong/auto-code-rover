        "intended_behavior": "The `bar` method needs to be enhanced to detect when the `bottom` parameter is provided with datetime objects and then apply an appropriate datetime converter to ensure the datetime units are correctly reflected on the plot's y-axis. This enhancement should preserve the existing functionality for non-datetime data, thereby maintaining backward compatibility. The implementation should seamlessly integrate with the existing plot rendering pipeline, requiring minimal to no manual intervention from the user to facilitate datetime plotting."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, the `barh` method should include a mechanism to detect datetime objects passed through the `left` parameter and appropriately convert them to ensure correct datetime units are displayed on the plot's x-axis. The modification should not disrupt or alter how the method handles other types of data. The approach should be consistent with how other plotting methods in Matplotlib manage datetime objects, ensuring a uniform user experience across different plot types."
