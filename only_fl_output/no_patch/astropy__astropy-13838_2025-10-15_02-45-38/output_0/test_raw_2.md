Given the context of the error (the issue cannot be reproduced as described because of the lack of numpy being installed), it seems that the instructions were misunderstood or there might be an error in executing the Python environment setup. However, if you're in a controlled environment where Python packages such as `numpy` and `astropy` are not installed by default, you need to ensure these are installed before trying to run the given `reproducer.py`.

However, addressing your request as if the previous attempt to run the script had not occurred or assuming that `numpy` and `astropy` are now correctly installed, I'll provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` which includes error handling for missing libraries as well:

```python
# reproducer.py
try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.table import QTable
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Missing module: {e.name}. Please ensure 'numpy' and 'astropy' are installed.")
    raise

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_printing_zero_length_array_cells():
    events = [{"A":0,"B":0, "C":np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A":1,"B":0, "C":np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A":2,"B":2, "C":np.array([0,1], dtype=np.uint64)}]

    try:
        # This will attempt to print the table with the first two events,
        # which contain 0-length arrays for "C". This should reproduce the error.
        print(QTable(rows=events[:2]))
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Printing tables with 0-length array cells failed") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_printing_zero_length_array_cells()
```

This script checks for the installation of necessary modules (`numpy` and `astropy`) and will raise an informative error if they are missing. However, it is crucial to ensure that the environment where this script is being executed has these dependencies installed. The error message about `numpy` not being found implies that the script is being run in an environment where `numpy` is not installed, which is a fundamental requirement for the `astropy` library to function, especially for handling array data as shown in the issue description.
