Given your instructions, it looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding the previous answer. Assuming a programming or test environment setup issue (like a missing `numpy` module which is crucial for reproducing the problem) occurred, it's important to ensure that all necessary dependencies such as `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in the environment where the script is to be executed. 

If the environment where the script is run does not have these modules installed, you would indeed encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This assumes that your environment is properly set up with `numpy` and `astropy` installed. If you are running this in an environment without these dependencies, please install them first using pip (`pip install numpy astropy`) before running the script.

However, if there was indeed an attempt to execute the script in a correctly set up environment (with `numpy` and `astropy` installed) and the test did not reproduce the issue as intended (exiting with code 1 due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`), it's possible that the environment from where the python script is being executed does not have access to the installed `numpy` and `astropy` packages. This scenario often occurs when using virtual environments or when the system has multiple Python installations and the script is not running with the intended interpreter version.

To ensure a correct reproduction of the issue, please confirm that:
1. `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in the same environment from where the script is executed.
2. You are using the correct Python interpreter linked to this environment.

Assuming these conditions are met and aiming to ensure adherence to your request, the previously provided script is designed to reproduce the issue following its execution in an environment where `numpy` and `astropy` are installed. If these dependencies are indeed missing from your environment, please install them first and then re-run the script.
