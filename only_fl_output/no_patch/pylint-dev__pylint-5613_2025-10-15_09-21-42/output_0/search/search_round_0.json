How `pyreverse` is currently integrated into Pylint, particularly focusing on any existing entry points for `pyreverse` within the Pylint codebase.\n2. The current method signature of `pylint.run_pyreverse()` to understand its limitation and how it's being called.\n3. The structure or existence of a `pyreverse` class/module and how it handles arguments (to see if the desired solution is feasible with the current architecture).\n\nGiven these requirements, I will make the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"run_pyreverse\")\n- search_code(\"pyreverse -o png -p\")"
