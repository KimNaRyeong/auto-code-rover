        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be extended or complemented with a new method that allows for programmatic usage of pyreverse. The new or updated method should accept arguments such as `output format`, `project name`, and `files` directly without relying on `sys.argv`. This means implementing or invoking `PyreverseRun` in a way that it can be used with parameters passed from within the code rather than command-line arguments. The existing functionality, which executes `PyreverseRun` with `sys.argv[1:]`, must be preserved for CLI usage. Essentially, a new interface or enhancement in this area should enable calling pyreverse like `pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)` from Python scripts."
