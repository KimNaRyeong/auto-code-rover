So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to locate where the cache backends are implemented and how the `.make_key()` and `.validate_key()` methods are currently used. The proposed solution suggests adding a helper function `make_and_validate_key` to the base cache backend class. Therefore, gathering context around the usage and implementation of these methods and any base cache backend class is crucial.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the base cache backend class where the new method `make_and_validate_key` would potentially be added. Since the issue doesn't specify the exact file names or class names, we'll use the search API to locate these items based on the method names and patterns mentioned. Specifically, we'll look for the existing methods `make_key` and `validate_key` to find out in which class or classes they are defined. This approach will help us understand the structure of the cache backends and where to integrate the new helper function.\n\n1. `search_method(\"make_key\")`: This will help us find all occurrences of the `make_key` method in the codebase and identify the files and classes they belong to.\n\n2. `search_method(\"validate_key\")`: Similar to the previous call, this will locate all usages of the `validate_key` method, providing insights into how validation of keys is currently handled and in which files and classes.\n\nThese searches will give us a comprehensive overview of where the changes proposed in the issue can be integrated."
