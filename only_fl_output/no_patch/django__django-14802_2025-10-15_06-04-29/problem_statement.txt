Add a helper function to make and validate cache keys.
Description
	
Following from â€‹this thread the following pattern is repeated a lot in the cache backends:
		key = self.make_key(key, version=version)
		self.validate_key(key)
We can define a helper function on the base cache backend that can be used to avoid repetitiveness and help ensure that we consistently call .validate_key() after .make_key():
	def make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None):
		key = self.make_key(key, version=version)
		self.validate_key(key)
		return key
An alternative proposal is to have .make_key() learn a validate flag, but we'd probably need to have it as False by default for backward compatibility and we'd may still have issues if users have overridden .make_key(). So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.
