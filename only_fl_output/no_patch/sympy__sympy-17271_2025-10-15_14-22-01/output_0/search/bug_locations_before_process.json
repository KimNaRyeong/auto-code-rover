        "intended_behavior": "For the given issue, the `frac` method's `eval` function needs a more specific behavior when encountering `S.ComplexInfinity` or the symbolic representation of infinity (`zoo`). Currently, it returns `None` for `S.ComplexInfinity`, which is mathematically unsound when performing further operations and causes the `TypeError`. Given that `frac` is designed to compute the fractional part of a number, and the fractional part of an infinite quantity or undefined form is not mathematically defined, the method should instead either:\n  - Explicitly handle `zoo` to return a result congruent with mathematical principles, if possible. However, since the fractional part of infinity is not defined, it's challenging to determine an appropriate mathematical return value.\n  - Raise a specific `ValueError` or custom error indicating that the fractional part of an infinite quantity (like `zoo`) cannot be calculated, rather than returning `None` or causing a `TypeError`. This approach would improve the robustness and usability of the `frac` function by providing users with a clear explanation of why the operation failed.\n\nThis adjusted behavior would preserve existing functionality while providing a more meaningful response for cases involving undefined or infinite quantities."
