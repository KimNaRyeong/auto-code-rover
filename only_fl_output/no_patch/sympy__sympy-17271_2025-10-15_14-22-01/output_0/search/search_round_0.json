        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with `frac(zoo)` resulting in a `TypeError`, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. To understand what the `frac` function is supposed to do and how it is implemented, especially when dealing with special arguments like `zoo`:\n   - `search_method(\"frac\")`\n\n2. Given the traceback pointing directly to `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` and the line numbers 311-312, getting the code around these lines will give us insight into how `frac` is handling inputs and where it might be failing with `zoo` which represents mathematical infinity in Sympy:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\", 311, 10)`\n\n3. To understand how `zoo` (likely representing \\(\\infty\\)) is supposed to interact with other functions or if there are specific implementations or cases for `zoo` within the `frac` function or more generally in Sympy:\n   - `search_code(\"zoo\")`\n\n4. Lastly, since the issue seems to involve type handling, specifically a `NoneType` and `Zero`, understanding how `NoneType` might be returned from operations involving `zoo` could help. However, specific API calls for this context would require already knowing where this handling is taking place, besides the mentioned `frac` function.\n\nThese calls should provide a solid starting point for understanding the problem and approaching a solution."
