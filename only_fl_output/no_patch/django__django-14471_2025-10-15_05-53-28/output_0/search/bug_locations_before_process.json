This change will avoid unnecessary generation of a new CSRF token that would be wasted effort since the request is going to be rejected due to the invalid format of the CSRF cookie. This behavior would be more efficient and aligns with the suggestion to let `InvalidTokenFormat` bubble up so it can be handled more appropriately, especially in contexts where an early rejection of the request is feasible and preferred. By avoiding the preemptive creation of a new token, the middleware will not only perform fewer operations but also make the flow of logic simpler and clearer. Thus, preserving the efficiency and clarity of CSRF token handling in requests."

        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior in the `process_view` method is to adjust its handling of CSRF tokens with the wrong format by incorporating an early rejection of such requests. Following the adjustment in `_get_token` to allow `InvalidTokenFormat` to propagate, `process_view` should catch this exception and reject the request immediately using the available rejection methods, using the reason provided by the exception. This direct rejection in `process_view` will address the reported issue effectively by preventing unnecessary processing for requests that are inevitably going to fail CSRF validation. It makes the CSRF protection more efficient by cutting down on redundant operations and helps in clearly indicating the nature of the failure to the developers or system administrators."
