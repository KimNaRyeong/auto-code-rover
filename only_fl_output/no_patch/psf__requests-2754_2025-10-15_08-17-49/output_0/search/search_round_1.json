This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to handling redirects to non-ASCII folder names in `.htaccess` configuration, executing targeted search API calls will be crucial. From the description, we need to understand how the project (probably a web server or a web application framework) handles `.htaccess` files and manages redirects. Specifically, the project might have custom handling for `.htaccess` files or might interact with the Apache server configuration in a specific way, including the processing of URIs with non-ASCII characters. Reflecting on the problem, useful information might be retrieved about:\n\n1. How redirection rules are parsed and executed from `.htaccess` files.\n2. Encoding handling for non-ASCII URIs during redirects.\n\nGiven we don't have explicit names of classes, methods, or files related to `.htaccess` handling or URI encoding from the issue description, our approach will start broadly and then narrow down based on findings. Here are some API calls that could provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for any code snippets or functions that handle redirects, specifically looking for \u201cRedirect\u201d or `.htaccess` related logic. This could provide leads on where and how redirect rules are processed.\n2. Since `.htaccess` is an Apache-related configuration, it's plausible that the project has utilities or modules specifically for handling Apache configurations. Searching for \"Apache\" or \".htaccess\" in class names or code snippets might reveal relevant parts of the project.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"Redirect /index.html\")\nsearch_code(\".htaccess\")\nsearch_code(\"URLEncoder\")  # To check if there's any standard URL encoding utility being used\nsearch_class(\"ApacheConfig\")\nsearch_code(\"encoding\")\n```\n\nGiven the wide scope, the intention is to first identify areas of the code that deal with redirect processing, `.htaccess` files, and encoding issues, which are likely at the heart of the described bug. Depending on the results from these initial searches, more targeted follow-up queries can be made to delve deeper into relevant classes, methods, or configuration files."

This outcome suggests that the project might not directly manipulate `.htaccess` files or contain explicit redirect definitions in the codebase as initially suspected. Likewise, there was no result for a search on `URLEncoder` or an `ApacheConfig` class, indicating these were not the right paths to follow given the project's architecture or naming conventions.\n\nThe productive lead comes from the broad search on \u201cencoding,\u201d which returned results from various parts of the `requests` library and its dependencies, including `urllib3` and `chardet`. Given that the issue involves a failed redirect to a non-ASCII URL and the error message indicates improper encoding (`The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.`), we can infer the following:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippets dealing with `encoding` likely include logic for handling the encoding and decoding of URL components, content negotiation, or detecting character sets of received content. This is crucial for properly interpreting and requesting URLs, especially those containing non-ASCII characters.\n   \n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug description points to an issue where non-ASCII characters in URLs are not being correctly handled upon redirection. The segments of code containing `encoding` logic are relevant since they may either contain the logic that fails to correctly encode/decode the non-ASCII characters in the URL or provide utilities that should be used to handle such characters but are currently being misused or not utilized for redirects.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to correctly encode the non-ASCII pathway (in this case, the Japanese `\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0`) as part of the URL for the redirection process, ensuring that web clients or libraries such as `requests` can accurately follow the redirect without encountering 404 errors due to misencoded URLs.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps would be to closely examine how requests and possibly `urllib3` handle the encoding for redirected URLs. It would be pertinent to:\n\n- Inspect the code in `requests/utils.py` and `requests/models.py`, since these files might contain utility functions or model definitions that deal with URL preparation and encoding.\n- Look at `requests/packages/urllib3/util/request.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` as these might include lower-level handling of request and response objects, including how redirects are processed and URLs are encoded or decoded.\n\nI'll now make the following search API calls to investigate further:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"encoding\", \"requests/utils.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"encoding\", \"requests/models.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"encoding\", \"requests/packages/urllib3/util/request.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"encoding\", \"requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\")`"

However, based on the analysis and understanding of the problem involving encoding errors during redirection to a URL with non-ASCII characters, potential areas for the bug and required fixes can be suggested in a general sense:\n\n   - **Potential Bug Location 1**:\n     - **File**: `requests/models.py`\n     - This file likely contains logic for assembling request URLs and might handle how redirects are processed, including the encoding of URLs.\n     - **Intended Behavior**: The code should ensure that when a redirect URL is processed, non-ASCII characters in the URL are correctly percent-encoded according to RFC 3986. This means that any handling of redirect locations should incorporate appropriate encoding functions to handle Unicode characters in URLs gracefully, ensuring that characters are correctly represented in the ASCII-only URL space. Additionally, if the URL is already in an encoded state, it should verify and preserve the encoding without double encoding.\n\n   - **Potential Bug Location 2**:\n     - **File**: `requests/utils.py`\n     - Given that utility functions for requests are located here, there might be functions related to URL parsing and encoding that are used in the process of handling redirects.\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Any utility functions that parse or prepare URLs for requests, including redirected URLs, should accurately encode non-ASCII characters. It should correctly recognize and convert Unicode characters into their percent-encoded form, ensuring compatibility across different web servers and compliance with internet standards for URLs.\n\n   - **Potential Bug Location 3**:\n     - **File**: `requests/packages/urllib3/util/request.py`\n     - This file probably includes lower-level request utilities used by `requests` that might also be involved in redirect handling or URL encoding.\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that utilities related to preparing or modifying request objects correctly handle encoding of non-ASCII characters in URLs. Specifically, functions that prepare or modify URLs during the redirect process should verify and properly percent-encode Unicode characters.\n\n   - **Potential Bug Location 4**:\n     - **File**: `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`\n     - This file is likely involved in processing responses, which may include handling of Location headers for redirects.\n     - **Intended Behavior**: The response handling, especially for 3XX status codes that involve redirects, should ensure that the Location header is correctly interpreted and that any non-ASCII URL is properly encoded before the client is redirected. \n\nThese suggested locations and intended behaviors provide a general roadmap for investigating and resolving the issue. Implementing these fixes requires careful consideration to not disrupt existing functionality, especially for the handling of ASCII-only URLs and maintaining backward compatibility."
