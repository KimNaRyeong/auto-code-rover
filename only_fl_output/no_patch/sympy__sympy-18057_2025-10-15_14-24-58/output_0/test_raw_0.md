Execution of this Python script as described (`python3 reproducer.py`) should help in reproducing the issue previously mentioned. It will raise an `AssertionError` if either of the issues (evaluating `__repr__` in `__eq__` method or incorrect equality comparison based on `__repr__`) is present, and it will provide a detailed stack trace if the first issue causes an exception as described. 

When the issues are addressed and fixed in SymPy, running this script should not produce any output or errors, indicating the absence of the reported problems.
