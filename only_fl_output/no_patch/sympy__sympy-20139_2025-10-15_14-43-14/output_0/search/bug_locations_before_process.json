        "intended_behavior": "Upon defining a `MatrixSymbol`, the `name` should remain a string rather than being converted to a `Symbol`. To fulfil the issue's requirement, the specific line that converts the name from a string to a `Symbol` (`name = Symbol(name)`) should be either removed or modified. The rest of the `__new__` method should be adjusted accordingly to ensure it does not rely on `name` being a `Symbol` object but rather expects it to be a string. All functionality within the class that uses the `name` field should be reviewed and, if necessary, updated to work correctly with `name` as a string to preserve the existing functionality while incorporating the new requirement."
