Given the constraints and requirements, here is a refined standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) that should be placed in the root directory of the project. This script is designed to reproduce the specific issue with the Turkish letter 'İ' when using Django's `slugify` function with `allow_unicode=True`. It will either raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or complete successfully if the issue is resolved.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import re
    import unicodedata
    from django.utils.text import slugify
    
    # Simulate Django's original slugify unicode regex pattern
    slug_unicode_re = re.compile(r'^[-\w]+\Z', re.U)

    title = "Hello İstanbul"
    expected_slug = "hello-istanbul"
    slug_result = slugify(title, allow_unicode=True)

    # Check all characters in slugified result against the regex
    for character in slug_result:
        if not slug_unicode_re.match(character):
            unicoded_name = unicodedata.name(character)
            raise AssertionError(f"Character '{character}' ({unicoded_name}) is not a valid slug character.")

    assert slug_result == expected_slug, f"Slugify returned unexpected result: {slug_result}. Expected: {expected_slug}"

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Signal failure with non-zero exit code
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # General error catch-all with non-zero exit code
else:
    print("SUCCESS: The slug was generated correctly.")
    exit(0)  # Success exit code
```

**Notes:** 

1. The script starts by trying to recreate the essential parts of the slugification process and validation, focusing on handling the Turkish 'İ' character.
2. It uses Django's `slugify` function with `allow_unicode=True`, expecting it to correctly handle the conversion of 'İ' to 'i'. It then checks the result against a regular expression pattern similar to Django's internal use pattern for slugs.
3. The script checks the final slug against an expected value to assert correct behavior. In this case, it's assuming the correct behavior would convert "Hello İstanbul" to "hello-istanbul".
4. If the result does not meet expectations, or an invalid character is detected, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, execute the `print_stacktrace` function to provide detailed error output, and exit with code 1, signaling an issue.
5. If the slug matches the expected result and no `AssertionError` is raised, the script prints a success message and exits with code 0, indicating the issue is not present.
