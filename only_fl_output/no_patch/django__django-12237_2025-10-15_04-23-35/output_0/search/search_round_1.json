        "content": "<issue>slugify() doesn't return a valid slug for \"\u0130\".\nDescription\nWhile working on an international project, we discovered that the turkish/azerbaijani letter \u0130 can not be properly processed when SlugField and slugify are run with allow_unicode=True.\nThe project itself runs with Django 2.2.6 and Wagtail 2.6.2. I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\ntitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n# EUREKA!!\n('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong.\nThe \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\nU+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context sheds light on the nature of the issue and points towards potential solutions.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Search Result for `Page` Class\nThe search for the `Page` class led us to a class in `django/core/paginator.py` rather than finding a user-defined `Page` model that would typically reside in a Django project's `models.py`. This `Page` class is a part of Django's pagination system and is unrelated to the issue at hand. The bug report mentions a `Page` model that stores a title and a slug, which means the actual `Page` class is likely a part of the project's models and not a standard Django class. This misdirection implies we might need to search specifically in project-specific model files or reconsider how the `Page` class is defined within the context of the Django/Wagtail project.\n\n#### 2. Search Results for `slugify` Method\nWe found two instances of `slugify`. The one in `django/utils/text.py` is of particular interest because it includes the `allow_unicode` parameter. The method description and the conditional handling based on `allow_unicode` suggest this function is directly responsible for converting input strings into slugs, handling Unicode characters differently based on the flag's value.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \nThe function transforms strings into URL slugs, which involves removing disallowed characters, converting spaces to hyphens, and, if `allow_unicode` is `False`, ensuring the string is ASCII. When `allow_unicode` is `True`, it normalizes the string but still applies regex to ensure the slug conforms to `[^\\w\\s-]`, thus enforcing that only word characters, spaces, or hyphens remain before converging spaces or hyphens into single hyphens and trimming the string.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**  \nSince the bug describes an issue with slugifying a string containing the character \"\u0130\", and the provided error arises from the `SlugField` validation layer post-`slugify` processing, it's clear that `slugify`'s handling of Unicode and the subsequent Django model field validation are central to the issue. Specifically, the bug arises from the \"\u0130\" character being processed into a lowercase \"i\" followed by a combining dot character, which the validation pattern does not recognize as part of a \"word character\".\n\n- **Intended behavior**  \nIdeally, the `slugify` method should convert all characters, including \"\u0130\", into forms that are seen as valid by the `SlugField` validation. This means potentially addressing the uniqueness of the Turkish \"\u0130\" character's lowercase conversion which should result in a simple \"i\" without a combining dot, ensuring compliance with the regex used for slug validation.\n\n#### Insights and Next Steps\nGiven the description and analysis:\n\n- **Slugify's Processing of Unicode Characters:** There's a mismatch between how `slugify` processes the \"\u0130\" character when `allow_unicode=True` and how Django's slug field validation expects valid slugs to be structured. The problem lies in the normalization and lowercasing steps which introduce characters (`COMBINING DOT ABOVE`) not recognized by the validation regex as part of a word character.\n\n- **Need for a Custom Fix:** The solution might involve a pre-processing step before calling `slugify` on specific Unicode characters like \"\u0130\" or adjusting `slugify` to handle these cases better.\n\nGiven that we didn't find the exact usage of `slugify(allow_unicode=True)` or the `full_clean` method in the context of a custom `Page` model, and considering the nature of the issue, a more precise approach might involve:\n\n1. **Directly tweaking the `slugify` function's handling of Unicode characters** or\n2. **Implementing a custom slugify wrapper in the project that handles problematic characters explicitly before passing them to Django's `slugify`.**\n\nFurthermore, inspecting how `SlugField` validation is implemented or searching for overrides of `full_clean` that might pertain to custom model handling not directly visible in the current search results could provide additional insights into resolving the validation error."

This might involve adding a pre-processing step specifically for this character and potentially other Unicode characters that behave similarly. The objective is to ensure that all characters are transformed into a format that will be considered valid by the `SlugField` validator, which expects slugs to comprise only Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. This alteration must preserve the existing functionality for all other characters and scenarios, only adjusting the handling for specific problematic Unicode characters to prevent the ValidationError."
