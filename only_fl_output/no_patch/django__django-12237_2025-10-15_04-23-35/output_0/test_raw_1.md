Given the error in the previous attempt, the instruction to simulate a small Django environment in the script led to a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the Django settings module (`'django_fake_settings'`) did not actually exist. To rectify this, we can bypass the need for a full Django setup for the purpose of this standalone script, focusing directly on reproducing the issue with `slugify` and handling Turkish letter 'İ'. 

Updating the script to remove Django dependencies that aren't crucial for demonstrating the `slugify` issue:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from django.utils.text import slugify
    from django.utils.regex_helper import _slug_unicode_re as slug_unicode_re
    import unicodedata

    # Directly test the slugify issue with Turkish 'İ'
    title_with_turkish_i = "Hello İstanbul"
    slug = slugify(title_with_turkish_i, allow_unicode=True)
    
    # Perform the check as described in the issue
    for char in slug:
        char_info = (char, unicodedata.name(char), slug_unicode_re.match(char) is not None)
        assert char_info[2], f"Character '{char_info[0]}' ({char_info[1]}) did not match slug regex."

except AssertionError as ae:
    print_stacktrace(ae)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the issue is present
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # General error exit code
else:
    print("No issue detected, slug generated successfully:", slug)
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code
    
```

**Note:** This script directly attempts to process the Turkish letter 'İ' with `slugify`, then iterates over the result to ensure all characters match the expected `slug_unicode_re` pattern. This directly addresses the core of the reported issue without needing a fake or actual Django project setup. If the character does not match (e.g., due to the described issue with `COMBINING DOT ABOVE`), an `AssertionError` will be raised, triggering the `print_stacktrace` function to detail the problem.
