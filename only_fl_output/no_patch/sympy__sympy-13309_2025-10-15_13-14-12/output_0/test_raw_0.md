Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the mentioned issue regarding the piecewise rewriting for `Min` and `Max` functions in a way that raises an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, and exits with code 0 if the issue is resolved. Make sure to have the necessary environment and dependencies set up to run this script, as it likely requires the `sympy` package for symbolic mathematics.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_piecewise_rewriting_for_max():
    from sympy import Max, Symbol, Piecewise

    a = Symbol('a')
    b = Symbol('b')

    expected = Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))
    result = Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)

    assert result == expected, "Piecewise rewriting for Max does not match expected output."

def main():
    try:
        test_piecewise_rewriting_for_max()
        print("Issue fixed or cannot reproduce.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script first defines a function to print the stack trace for any caught exceptions in a readable format, then it defines a test function that attempts to rewrite a `Max` function in its piecewise form using SymPy's functionality. If the piecewise rewriting for `Max` does not work as expected, it raises an `AssertionError`, indicating the issue is still present. When running, the script will print a detailed stack trace if the test fails, or a confirmation message if the test passes.

Please ensure you have SymPy installed in your environment (e.g., using `pip install sympy`) before executing this script. Run this script in the root directory of your project with Python 3 to check if the issue can be reproduced.
