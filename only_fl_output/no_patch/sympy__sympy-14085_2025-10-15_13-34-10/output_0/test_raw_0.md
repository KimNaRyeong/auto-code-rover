Make sure you have SymPy installed in your Python environment to execute this script. You can install SymPy using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

When you run `python3 reproducer.py`, the script will attempt to use `sympify` to convert the unicode character "α" to a SymPy object. If the issue is present, it will catch the exception, print the stack trace, and raise an `AssertionError`. If the issue has been fixed, and `sympify` can now handle the "α" character, it will print "Issue seems to be fixed" and exit with code 0.
