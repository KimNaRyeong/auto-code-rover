This script reproduces the issue mentioned by executing a test function that attempts to sympify the Greek letter alpha. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` or a `SympifyError`, triggering the printing of the stack trace. If the `sympify` function successfully converts the Greek letter to the expected symbolic representation, it indicates the issue is fixed, and it prints a confirmation message.
