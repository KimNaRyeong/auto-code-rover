        "content": "To address the issue of `sympify(u\"\u03b1\")` not working, we need to gather more context from several key components mentioned in the issue description. These components include the `sympify` function itself, `ast_parser`, and their respective surroundings where the error has been observed. Let's formulate the API calls around these focal points:\n\n1. Search for the `sympify` function in the entire codebase to understand its implementation and how it is supposed to work with different inputs, including Greek letters like \"\u03b1\".\n2. Search for the `ast_parser` class (or module, as it might be ambiguously referred to in the stack trace) to understand how expressions are parsed and where the parsing of Greek letters could be failing.\n3. Given that the error traceback has thrown a `SympifyError` indicating \"Cannot parse.\", it could be beneficial to investigate the places in the codebase where `SympifyError` is raised, especially related to parsing issues.\n4. The use of greek letters and their transformation or recognition within the codebase (since \"\u03b1\" is the pretty-printed form of \"alpha\") should be looked into. This might require finding how symbols are handled, especially those that are pretty-printed.\n\nBased on these points, here are the specific API calls that we can make:\n\n- `search_method(\"sympify\")` to get an overview of how `sympify` is implemented.\n- `search_class(\"ast_parser\")` or `search_code(\"ast_parser\")` depending on whether \"ast_parser\" is referred to as a class or module/function grouping. This is to clarify its role in expression parsing.\n- `search_code(\"raise SympifyError\")` to locate where in the codebase this exception is raised, particularly in parsing scenarios.\n- `search_code(u\"\u03b1\")` and `search_code(\"alpha\")` to investigate the handling of Greek letters and their corresponding English names throughout the project.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the issue's context and how the project's current codebase deals with such inputs."
