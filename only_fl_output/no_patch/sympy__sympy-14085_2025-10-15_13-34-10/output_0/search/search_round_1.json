        "content": "To address the issue of `sympify(u\"\u03b1\")` not working, we need to gather more context from several key components mentioned in the issue description. These components include the `sympify` function itself, `ast_parser`, and their respective surroundings where the error has been observed. Let's formulate the API calls around these focal points:\n\n1. Search for the `sympify` function in the entire codebase to understand its implementation and how it is supposed to work with different inputs, including Greek letters like \"\u03b1\".\n2. Search for the `ast_parser` class (or module, as it might be ambiguously referred to in the stack trace) to understand how expressions are parsed and where the parsing of Greek letters could be failing.\n3. Given that the error traceback has thrown a `SympifyError` indicating \"Cannot parse.\", it could be beneficial to investigate the places in the codebase where `SympifyError` is raised, especially related to parsing issues.\n4. The use of greek letters and their transformation or recognition within the codebase (since \"\u03b1\" is the pretty-printed form of \"alpha\") should be looked into. This might require finding how symbols are handled, especially those that are pretty-printed.\n\nBased on these points, here are the specific API calls that we can make:\n\n- `search_method(\"sympify\")` to get an overview of how `sympify` is implemented.\n- `search_class(\"ast_parser\")` or `search_code(\"ast_parser\")` depending on whether \"ast_parser\" is referred to as a class or module/function grouping. This is to clarify its role in expression parsing.\n- `search_code(\"raise SympifyError\")` to locate where in the codebase this exception is raised, particularly in parsing scenarios.\n- `search_code(u\"\u03b1\")` and `search_code(\"alpha\")` to investigate the handling of Greek letters and their corresponding English names throughout the project.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the issue's context and how the project's current codebase deals with such inputs."

Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n193     be denested first.

The key is the class and the value is a\n224     function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n225     object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n226 \n227     >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n228     ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n229     ...         yield 1\n230     ...         yield 2\n231     ...         return\n232     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n233     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n234     >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n235     >>> sympify(MyList2())\n236     Matrix([\n237     [1],\n238     [2]])\n239 \n240     Notes\n241     =====\n242 \n243     Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n244     that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n245     autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n246     some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n247     -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n248 \n249     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n250     >>> from sympy.abc import x\n251     >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n252     -1\n253     >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n254     >>> sympify(s)\n255     -1\n256     >>> kernS(s)\n257     -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n258 \n259     \"\"\"\n260     if evaluate is None:\n261         if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n262             evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n263         else:\n264             evaluate = True\n265     try:\n266         if a in sympy_classes:\n267             return a\n268     except TypeError: # Type of a is unhashable\n269         pass\n270     try:\n271         cls = a.__class__\n272     except AttributeError:  # a is probably an old-style class object\n273         cls = type(a)\n274     if cls in sympy_classes:\n275         return a\n276     if cls is type(None):\n277         if strict:\n278             raise SympifyError(a)\n279         else:\n280             return a\n281 \n282     # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n283     # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n284     if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n285         import numpy as np\n286         if np.isscalar(a):\n287             return _convert_numpy_types(a)\n288 \n289     try:\n290         return converter[cls](a)\n291     except KeyError:\n292         for superclass in getmro(cls):\n293             try:\n294                 return converter[superclass](a)\n295             except KeyError:\n296                 continue\n297 \n298     if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n299         raise SympifyError(a)\n300 \n301     try:\n302         return a._sympy_()\n303     except AttributeError:\n304         pass\n305 \n306     if not strict:\n307         # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n308         # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n309         try:\n310             from ..tensor.array import Array\n311             return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n312         except AttributeError:\n313             pass\n314 \n315     if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n316         for coerce in (float, int):\n317             try:\n318                 return sympify(coerce(a))\n319             except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, SympifyError):\n320                 continue\n321 \n322     if strict:\n323         raise SympifyError(a)\n324 \n325     if iterable(a):\n326         try:\n327             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n328                 rational=rational) for x in a])\n329         except TypeError:\n330             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n331             pass\n332     if isinstance(a, dict):\n333         try:\n334             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n335                 rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n336         except TypeError:\n337             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n338             pass\n339 \n340     # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n341     # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n342     # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n343     # anything to SymPy expression).\n344     #\n345     # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n346     # and try to parse it.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API results, we encounter several critical aspects related to the `sympify` function and the handling of Greek letters in SymPy.\n\n### sympify Function Analysis\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `sympify` function in the file `sympy/core/sympify.py` is designed to convert arbitrary expressions into types that can be used within SymPy. This includes converting Python numeric types into SymPy numeric types (e.g., `int` to `sympy.Integer`, `float` to `sympy.Float`), strings into symbolic expressions, and more complex cases like lists, sets, or tuples containing compatible types. Notably, it attempts to handle strings representing mathematical expressions by parsing them, potentially evaluating them, and converting them into SymPy's symbolic form.\n\n#### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe issue involves `sympify`'s inability to parse and convert the Greek letter \"\u03b1\" into a symbolic expression even though it's used as the pretty-printed form of certain SymPy symbols (e.g., `Symbol('alpha')`). The stack trace in the issue report suggests that the problem might reside in how string inputs are processed and parsed into expressions. Specifically, the `parse_expr` utility is called within `sympify` to handle string inputs, which might not properly account for or translate certain Unicode characters like Greek letters.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would seem to be for `sympify` to recognize and correctly parse the Greek letter \"\u03b1\" as a symbolic expression that SymPy can work with, akin to how it deals with its English counterpart \"alpha.\" This should happen without raising a `SympifyError` due to parsing failure.\n\n### Handling of Greek Letters\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe search results didn't directly return information on how Greek letters are specifically parsed or converted within the `sympify` process or elsewhere. However, a mention of handling single-letter and Greek-letter variables using dictionaries like `_clash1`, `_clash2`, or `_clash` suggests there is some mechanism designed to manage symbol names, potentially including Greek ones, and differentiate them from common variable names to avoid name clashes.\n\n#### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe absence of specific handling or recognition of \"\u03b1\" as a special case in the returned results leads to speculation that the bug may stem from a missing or inadequate implementation for parsing Greek letters. The mechanism for handling single-letter and Greek-letter variables in a manner to avoid clashes might not extend to converting these from their Unicode representations back to their symbolic names, which is essential for `sympify` to recognize and parse them correctly.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nIdeally, the part of the code handling Greek letters should ensure that representations such as \"\u03b1\" are identifiable and convertible to their symbolic equivalents within SymPy, thus allowing `sympify` (or related parsing mechanisms) to process expressions containing these letters correctly.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, it seems the parsing mechanism (`parse_expr` within `sympify`) might not properly interpret Greek letters. A potential next step could involve investigating how `parse_expr` works, particularly regarding its handling of Unicode characters like Greek letters and its interaction with Symbol naming conventions within SymPy. It might be beneficial to:\n\n- Make an API call to search for use cases or the implementation of `parse_expr` or mechanisms that manage the conversion or recognition of Greek letters in symbolic expressions.\n\nBased on the functionality of `sympify` and the intended handling of Greek letters, any patch or solution would need to ensure that `parse_expr` can correctly recognize and interpret \"\u03b1\" and similar characters as their symbolic equivalents (e.g., recognizing \"\u03b1\" as `Symbol('alpha')`)."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. \n- **Bug Location 1:**\n  - **File:** sympy/core/sympify.py\n  - **Method:** sympify\n    - **Intended Behavior:** To resolve the issue, the `sympify` method should be enhanced to explicitly recognize and convert Unicode Greek letters (e.g., \"\u03b1\") to their symbolic name equivalents within SymPy (e.g., `Symbol('alpha')`). The method already handles conversions of various types into SymPy recognized objects. However, for Greek letters like \"\u03b1\", there needs to be an addition or enhancement in the logic where it identifies these characters and maps them to their corresponding symbolic representations. This might involve extending the existing conversion or parsing mechanism to include a step specifically for handling Unicode Greek letters. This addition should preserve the general functionality of transforming different data types and expressions into SymPy-compatible symbolic objects without disrupting other conversion processes.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py\n  - **Method:** parse_expr\n    - **Intended Behavior:** If the issue arises from how expressions are parsed (which could not be directly verified from the API call responses but is suggested by the use of `parse_expr` in `sympify`), then `parse_expr` may require adjustments to properly interpret and convert Unicode Greek symbols into their appropriate SymPy symbolic expressions. Although we couldn't directly inspect `parse_expr` due to the limitations in provided search results, an improvement here would involve ensuring that the parsing process includes steps for recognizing Unicode representations of Greek letters, treating them equivalently to their English symbolic names. This enhancement would enable `parse_expr` to operate correctly on strings containing such characters, expanding its ability to parse and convert a wider range of symbolic expressions into SymPy's format.\n\nThese targeted modifications aim to allow SymPy to accurately interpret and work with expressions involving Greek letters, eliminating the current `SympifyError` when encountering Unicode characters for these symbols."
