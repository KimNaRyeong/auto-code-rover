You should replace this mock with the actual `two_sum` function from the relevant `astropy` module where the issue has been observed.\n\nThis script checks the symmetry of the `two_sum` function's results for specific floating-point values that are particularly challenging in terms of numerical precision. If the function is working correctly, it should exit without any exceptions. Any `AssertionError` provoked by the assert statement would prompt the `print_stacktrace` function to run, providing a detailed traceback of the error and its context within the script."
