        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to detect and correctly normalize decimal numbers provided in scientific notation before performing validations for the number of digits and decimal places. This enhancement involves adding a pre-validation step to check if the input value is in scientific notation (e.g., matches a regex pattern for scientific notation) and, if so, converting it to a standard decimal format (e.g., using Decimal(value).normalize()) before proceeding with the existing validation logic. This modification must be done ensuring that any input which is currently handled as valid remains so, ensuring this fix only expands the method's ability to interpret and validate scientific notation correctly."

        "method": "run_validators",
        "intended_behavior": "While the run_validators method might not directly relate to handling the scientific notation, it's crucial that this method, which orchestrates the validation process, supports the capability to validate decimal numbers in both standard and scientific notation seamlessly. This method should ensure that all validators in the validation chain can handle decimal values correctly post-normalization. If necessary, this could involve ensuring validators are aware of and can correctly interpret the normalized decimal numbers. While no specific change is suggested here without further context, being mindful of how validators are executed and ensuring they are compatible with normalized decimal inputs could be a consideration to prevent similar issues."
