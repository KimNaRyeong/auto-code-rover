When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n# String content\nresponse = HttpResponse(\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is correct\n# Bytes content\nresponse = HttpResponse(b\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is also correct\n# memoryview content\nresponse = HttpResponse(memoryview(b\"My Content\"))\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'\n# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'\n</issue>"

We need to understand how the `content` attribute is managed:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n\n3. **Search for any code that handles or transforms `memoryview` objects within the `HttpResponse` class**. This will help us identify if there's any existing logic that we might need to augment or fix to correctly handle `memoryview` objects:\n   - `search_code_in_class(\"memoryview\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n\nEach of these calls will provide necessary insights into the handling of different content types in `HttpResponse` and help us understand where the issue might be stemming from and how best to approach fixing it."
