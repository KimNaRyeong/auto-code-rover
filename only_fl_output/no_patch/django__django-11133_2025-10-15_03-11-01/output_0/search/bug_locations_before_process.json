        "intended_behavior": "Currently, when a value is set to the content property of an HttpResponse object, there appears to be a lack of handling for memoryview objects, resulting in incorrect representation (b'<memory at 0x...>'). The content setter method should be updated to check if the input value is a memoryview. If it is, it should convert the memoryview to bytes before setting it as the content. This would ensure that memoryview objects are correctly interpreted as their underlying binary data, preserving the expected behavior as seen with strings or byte strings. This change should preserve the existing functionality for all other types of inputs to the content property, ensuring that text or bytes inputs are handled as they were before. Only memoryview objects would trigger this specific conversion behavior, making HttpResponse compatible with binary data coming from different databases or file reads that might utilize memoryview for efficiency."
