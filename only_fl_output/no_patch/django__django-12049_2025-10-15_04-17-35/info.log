</code><intended_behavior>Although we didn't directly retrieve information on `get_table_description`, the intended behavior in the backend-specific introspection API would involve ensuring that the retrieval and comparison of table descriptions (including column names) respect the database's case sensitivity settings. If necessary, Django's database backend for the specific database in use (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) might require adjustments or enhancements to its introspection methods to ensure column names are correctly handled in a manner consistent with the database's case sensitivity settings. This might mean adjusting how column names are fetched and compared, possibly including an option or check for case sensitivity as part of the method's logic or in its callers.</intended_behavior>]

</code><intended_behavior>This method should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the field names defined in Django models and the column names in the database schema when determining if a migration has been implicitly applied. This adjustment will account for databases with case-insensitive collation settings, ensuring that Django accurately detects the current state of the schema and appropriately applies or skips migrations. The intended behavior must preserve the method's ability to detect if tables or columns specified by migrations exist in the database, without falsely indicating that a migration has not been applied due to case differences in column names. This can potentially involve normalizing case before comparison or utilizing database introspection capabilities that account for the database's collation settings during comparison.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/migrations/executor.py</file>
