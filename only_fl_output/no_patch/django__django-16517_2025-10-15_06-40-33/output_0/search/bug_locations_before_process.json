        "intended_behavior": "The method `_get_view_func` should accurately resolve and return the view function or class method as specified by the view name string without altering its case, effectively handling both function-based and class-based views. This involves preserving the case sensitivity during import and retrieval operations to ensure that class-based views, which are case-sensitive, are correctly matched. The method should also ensure that the processing of view names that include class names is robust enough to correctly separate and import the class and method without falling into case sensitivity or import issues. This might involve refining the logic that parses the \"module.class.method\" format to accurately handle class names and ensuring proper import and resolution of these components as intended. Overall, the adjustment must ensure that documentation links for class-based views (with case-sensitive paths) are generated and resolved correctly, preventing 404 errors due to case mismatches or incorrect parsing. This entails a careful preservation of case from the URL/docstring through to the actual view resolution process."
