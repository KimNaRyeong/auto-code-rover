        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides a good foundation to understand the root cause of the issue and propose a solution.\n\n### Analysis of `_get_view_func` in `ViewDetailView`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The `_get_view_func` method in `ViewDetailView` is designed to fetch the actual view function/class based on its string representation from the URLconf (the URL configuration of the Django project). It tries to resolve the supplied view name to a callable. This involves:\n  1. Checking if the supplied view argument represents a callback in the URLconf.\n  2. Attempting to split the view representation into its module and function parts using `mod, func = get_mod_func(view)`.\n  3. Initially, it tries to import the module and retrieve the function. If this import fails, it implies the view might contain a class name, and it attempts to parse the string again to separate the module from the class and then retrieve the function/class method.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n\n- The issue description suggests that when specifying a view in the documentation using `:view:` with mixed-case names (e.g., `:view:orders.views.Orders`), a 404 error occurs upon trying to access the documentation link generated for that view. This indicates a potential problem in how the `_get_view_func` handles case sensitivity or parsing of the view string with class names.\n- The bug might be tied to how the view name is handled - whether the resolution process alters the case sensitivity or incorrectly parses view names with classes, leading to a failure in finding the view when generating documentation links.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\n- The intended behavior for `_get_view_func` in this context should include successfully resolving both function-based and class-based views regardless of their case (while noting that Python class names are case-sensitive). It should correctly identify and import the module and class/function as specified, even when the view includes uppercase characters as noted in class-based views (`Orders` in the issue description).\n- Ensuring that the documentation links generated are accurately matched with case-sensitive paths where necessary, or appropriately handling case variations to avoid 404 errors when accessing view documentation.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\nGiven the described issue and analyzed code context, a potential patch might involve:\n\n1. Ensuring that case sensitivity is preserved where necessary throughout the view resolution process. This might require checking if the current implementation inadvertently lowercases or modifies the view string in a way that could affect resolution.\n   \n2. Improving the parsing logic in `_get_view_func` to more accurately handle class-based views, especially if part of the problem lies in how the module and class names are extracted and imported.\n\n3. An audit of the path generated for the documentation links to ensure they accurately reflect the case-sensitive nature of Python classes, potentially adjusting how these links are generated or resolved.\n\nTo move forward with a patch, a deeper dive into both the link generation for views in the Django admin documentation and the view resolution mechanism as implemented in `_get_view_func` would be necessary. This could involve testing with mixed-case class-based views and assessing if the current logic misconstrues or mishandles such cases, leading to the observed 404 errors."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Bug Locations:\n\nLocation 1: File: django/contrib/admindocs/views.py, Class: ViewDetailView, Method: _get_view_func\n\nIntended Behavior:\n- The method `_get_view_func` should accurately resolve and return the view function or class method as specified by the view name string without altering its case, effectively handling both function-based and class-based views. This involves preserving the case sensitivity during import and retrieval operations to ensure that class-based views, which are case-sensitive, are correctly matched.\n- The method should also ensure that the processing of view names that include class names is robust enough to correctly separate and import the class and method without falling into case sensitivity or import issues. This might involve refining the logic that parses the \"module.class.method\" format to accurately handle class names and ensuring proper import and resolution of these components as intended.\n- Overall, the adjustment must ensure that documentation links for class-based views (with case-sensitive paths) are generated and resolved correctly, preventing 404 errors due to case mismatches or incorrect parsing. This entails a careful preservation of case from the URL/docstring through to the actual view resolution process."
