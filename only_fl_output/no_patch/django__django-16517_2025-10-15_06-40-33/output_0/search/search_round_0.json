Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. To inspect the implementation of the `ViewDetailView`, which is raising the 404 error:\n   - `search_class(class_name=\"ViewDetailView\")`\n\n2. Since the issue might relate to the method `_get_view_func`, which could be responsible for handling or modifying the case of the views' names:\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"_get_view_func\")`\n\n3. And to directly investigate the specific location mentioned in the issue within `admindocs/views.py`, where the doc comment `:view:orders.views.Orders` could be processed:\n   - `get_code_around_line(file_path=\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", line_number=168, window_size=10)`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive context surrounding the handling of view names, how they are processed, and possibly transformed, which leads to the discrepancy between the actual view path and the lowercase path used by the admindocs system."
