Search for the `Cosmology` class to get an overview and locate the relevant file(s): `search_class(\"Cosmology\")`\n\n2.

To gather more information on how the `to_table` method might be used with `Cosmology`, it's important to find its current implementation or reference: `search_method(\"to_table\")`\n\n4.

Investigating `def_unit` could provide insights on implementing the suggested feature: `search_method(\"def_unit\")`\n\nThese API calls will help in understanding how the `Cosmology.write` method functions, how tables are currently created and manipulated within the Astropy Cosmology module, and the method of implementing formatting options for units, which can serve as an analogy for implementing the MathJax formatting."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address each piece in turn:\n\n### 1. Class `Cosmology` in `astropy/cosmology/core.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Cosmology` class is defined as an abstract base class (`abc.ABCMeta`) in the Astropy library for cosmology calculations. It includes methods for cloning, comparison, and representation. Notably, it supports `read` and `write` through `UnifiedReadWriteMethod`, indicating an interface for I/O operations.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** \n  Given that the issue concerns extending the `Cosmology.write` method to support HTML output, understanding this class is crucial. The issue indicates a lack of direct `write_html` method implementation, which is consistent with the search result failing to find the `write` method directly in the `Cosmology` class. It suggests that `write` functionality is likely handled through a unified interface (`UnifiedReadWriteMethod`), which we'd need to extend or modify to add HTML support.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  Extend or utilize the current `Cosmology.write` function (or the underlying mechanism it uses) to allow exporting a cosmology object to HTML, potentially leveraging and formatting the output with MathJax for displaying mathematical expressions beautifully.\n\n### 2. Method `to_table` in Various Files\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  Although not directly shown, the method `to_table` likely converts data into a table format. The presence of this method within `astropy/cosmology/io/table.py` suggests it's used for representing cosmology data as a table, which aligns with the issue's suggest use in preparing data for HTML output.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** \n  The proposal to use `cosmology.io.table.to_table()` as a stepping stone for producing HTML output makes sense - converting the cosmology object to a table is a logical first step before formatting it as HTML.\n\n### 3. `def_unit` in `astropy/units/core.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `def_unit` function allows defining new units with documentation, optional representation in various formats (including MathJax for LaTeX), and prefix handling. It either creates a new `Unit` or an `IrreducibleUnit` based on whether it represents another unit.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** \n  The issue suggestion to model the MathJax representation on the `format` argument in `def_unit` implies using a similar approach for enhancing `Cosmology` parameters with MathJax formats. Understanding `def_unit` provides insight into implementing format customization in another context (cosmology parameters), indicating how format specifications could be integrated.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  Implement a mechanism similar to `def_unit`'s `format` argument for cosmology parameters, allowing them to specify MathJax formatting. This would be used in the HTML output to render parameters with appropriate mathematical notation.\n\n### Missing Context and Next Steps:\n\nGiven the absence of the direct implementation details for `Cosmology.write`, a closer examination of how the `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` works and how it interfaces with `Cosmology` for I/O operations could provide the necessary context for extending it to support HTML format output with MathJax. Further investigation into how the `write` method in `astropy/io/registry/core.py` and perhaps examples of `QTable.write(..., format='html')` could offer insights into how to implement the requested feature.\n\nWith this analysis, additional steps could involve:\n\n- Investigating the implementation of `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` to understand how it currently facilitates I/O operations for cosmology objects.\n- Exploring `QTable.write` further, given its direct mention in the issue for its role in writing out HTML, and to understand possible integration points for formatting with MathJax."
