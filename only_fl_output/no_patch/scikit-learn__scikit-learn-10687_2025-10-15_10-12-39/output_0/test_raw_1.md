Based on the requirement and correcting the misunderstanding, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This should properly attempt to reproduce the described issue, raising an `AssertionError` if the problem persists and exiting gracefully with code 0 if it has been fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

        # Test Lasso with fit_intercept=True
        est_intercept = Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
        est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Expected coef_ shape with fit_intercept=True is (1,) but got {}".format(est_intercept.coef_.shape)

        # Test Lasso with fit_intercept=False
        est_no_intercept = Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        
        # The issue is about this assertion failing due to the shape not being (1,)
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Expected coef_ shape with fit_intercept=False is (1,) but got {}".format(est_no_intercept.coef_.shape)

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the assertion fails

    print("Issue not reproduced, test passed.")
    exit(0)  # Exit successfully if the assertions pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script focuses on reproducing the issue related to the `shape` of `coef_` attribute for `linear_model.Lasso` when using `fit_intercept=False`. The inclusion of this revised script as `reproducer.py` should exactly target the reported problem, following your instructions on providing clear tracebacks for any AssertionError encountered.
