        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the `coef_` attribute, specifically when `fit_intercept=False`, needs to ensure that the shape of `coef_` remains consistent with the expectations, regardless of whether an intercept is fit. The fix should ensure: - When `fit_intercept=False`, the `coef_` array should correctly reflect the dimensions for the predictors without adding an intercept term, i.e., maintaining a shape that matches the number of features (predictors) in the input data. - The behavior of the `fit` method, possibly inherited from `ElasticNet` or defined behavior within `Lasso`, needs to be reviewed to ensure it's correctly handling `coef_` shape adjustments based on the `fit_intercept` parameter. This includes ensuring the post-fit `coef_` shape is `(1,)` when fitting a single feature without intercept as highlighted in the issue description. - The resolution should preserve all existing functionality, ensuring that the `fit` method continues to accurately fit the model, calculate coefficients (`coef_`), and, if `fit_intercept=True`, correctly manage the intercept term without introducing shape inconsistencies or other regressions."
