Given the updated requirement to include the specific function for printing a stack trace, please find below a revised `reproducer.py` Python script designed to accurately reflect the issue you're encountering. If the issue persists, this script will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a detailed stack trace of the problem. Conversely, if the issue is fixed, the script will complete successfully and exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

        # Test Lasso with fit_intercept=True to serve as a reference.
        est_intercept = Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
        est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), f"Expected coef_ shape with fit_intercept=True is (1,), got {est_intercept.coef_.shape}"

        # Test Lasso with fit_intercept=False which is expected to raise an issue.
        est_no_intercept = Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), f"Expected coef_ shape with fit_intercept=False is (1,), got {est_no_intercept.coef_.shape}"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code indicating the issue is present.

    print("Issue not reproduced, test passed.")
    exit(0)  # Exit successfully indicating the issue is fixed.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Place this file at the root directory of the project and execute it using `python3 reproducer.py`. The execution flow is designed such that an `AssertionError` highlights the occurrence of the problem as described. The custom `print_stacktrace` function ensures that any exception raised is accompanied by an informative traceback, enhancing debugging capabilities by pinpointing the exact source of failure within the script.
