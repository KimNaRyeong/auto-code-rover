For `BinaryField`, it should ensure that the default value is processed as a binary string (i.e., `b''`) instead of a regular string (`''`). This involves explicitly checking the field's type and applying the correct data type conversion for its default value. This modification will prevent type errors during reverse migrations by ensuring that non-bytestring defaults are not improperly passed through migration operations that expect binary string defaults."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the `BinaryField` class consistently handles defaults as binary data. While the specific adjustment may not be directly within the method (given the nature of the bug involves migrations handling), a closer inspection or a new method might be required to ensure that whenever a default is set or changed, it's appropriately checked and converted to binary format if not already. This ensures that any operation involving the field's default, especially in migrations, handles these values correctly, preventing errors when binary data expectations are not met."
