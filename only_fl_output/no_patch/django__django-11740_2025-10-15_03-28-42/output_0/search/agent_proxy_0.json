Given the details, I will use the following search API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"App1\")`: This will give us information about the `App1` class in `TestApp1`, particularly how the `another_app` field is initially set up as a `UUIDField` and how it is being changed to a `ForeignKey`.\n\n2. `search_class(\"App2\")`: This will provide information about the `App2` class in `TestApp2`, which is referenced by the `ForeignKey` in `App1`.\n\n3. `search_code(\"dependencies\")`: Since the issue mentions that the migration does not create any \"dependencies\" for `App2` due to the `ForeignKey`, searching for \"dependencies\" might reveal how migrations handle dependencies in general.\n\n4. `search_code(\"Migration\")`: This call is intended to find how Migration classes are being generated or manipulated within the project, which might shed light on why the expected dependencies are not being created.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the areas in the project that are most relevant to the described issue, allowing for a better understanding of what might be going wrong."
