### Notes

1. This script attempts to programmatically change a field type from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey`. However, Django models are not designed to have their fields altered in this manner at runtime, so the approach used in the `change_field_to_fk()` function is unconventional and not recommended.

2. The correct approach to altering a field type involves creating a new migration that changes the field within your database schema. This script bypasses Django's migration system and does not reflect changes in the actual database.

3. Due to the direct manipulation of model class internals, this script might fail or produce unintended side effects. It's meant to represent the described issue but doesn't follow Django's best practices for schema modification.

4. Before running this script, ensure your Django project (`testproject`) and settings module are correctly configured and that the database supports the operations. This includes having the necessary definitions in your `settings.py` (e.g., `DATABASES` configuration) and running Django migrations to initialize the database state.
