This involves identifying the relevant classes or methods where the validation of `__isnull` values occurs or should occur. Here are the steps and corresponding API calls we could make to gather the needed context:\n\n1. Since `__isnull` is most likely part of a query interface or a model query parameter in a web framework (like Django), we need to locate its handling mechanism. We might start by looking for methods or classes related to query processing.\n\n2. The name `__isnull` suggests it's used with field lookups or query annotations, so we're looking for query-related classes or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) utilities.\n\nGiven the above, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help identify if there's a dedicated method handling `__isnull` directly in the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"__isnull\")`: Since `__isnull` might not be a standalone method but part of larger query construction or validation logic, searching for the code snippet itself can lead us to the right locations in the project where it's being handled or parsed.\n\nThese calls are aimed at pinpointing the exact implementation or validation locations for `__isnull`, which we can then examine to understand where and how to introduce error-raising for non-boolean values."

This will guide us in understanding the existing handling of `__isnull` and how to modify it to introduce error raising for non-boolean values.\n\n### Files Analysis\n\n1. **django/db/models/query.py**: \n   - **Role**: This file is likely responsible for defining and executing queries on models. This includes constructing querysets, applying filters, and possibly managing lookups.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: Since `__isnull` is a lookup, its logic could be invoked here when filters are applied in queries. If `__isnull` lookups are processed or validated in this file, we might need to adjust this logic to enforce boolean value constraints.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Reject `__isnull` lookups with non-boolean values by raising an error to prevent misuse and ensure consistency.\n\n2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**: \n   - **Role**: This file likely deals with the SQL construction aspect of model queries, transforming Django query expressions into SQL statements.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: If `__isnull` is translated into SQL here, then this might be where the check for boolean values should be enforced to prevent generating invalid or unintended SQL queries.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Validate `__isnull` usage at or before the SQL generation phase to ensure only boolean values are used.\n\n3. **django/contrib/admin/utils.py** and **django/contrib/admin/filters.py**: \n   - **Role**: These files likely support the Django admin interface, providing utilities and filter options for managing model data through the admin portal.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: The admin interface using `__isnull` lookups would indicate these lookups are widely utilized across different parts of the framework, including admin list filters. Misuse in these areas can lead to incorrect data display or filtering issues in the admin.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure admin utilities and filters that leverage `__isnull` enforce the boolean value constraint, maintaining administrative integrity and user experience.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, the next step should involve a closer look at the specific implementation of `__isnull` handling in the identified files. To properly enforce the intended behavior, we need to pinpoint where exactly in the codebase the validation for boolean values can be implemented or is missing. \n\nGiven the dispersed nature of `__isnull` references, it might be beneficial to explore one or two specific files, particularly `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, as they are central to query processing and the SQL generation phase, respectively.\n\nConsidering this, the following API calls will provide us with the needed details:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"__isnull\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`: To get more specifics on how `__isnull` lookups are handled within querysets.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"__isnull\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`: To understand how `__isnull` lookups are transformed into SQL queries and where validation could be applied."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

If a non-boolean value is provided, the code should raise a ValueError with a clear message indicating that only boolean values are acceptable for `__isnull` lookups. This behavior will prevent misuse and maintain consistency across different usage scenarios.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: django/db/models/sql/query.py\n  - **Intended Behavior**: In the part of the code that translates Django query expressions (including `__isnull`) into SQL statements, ensure that a validation for `__isnull` values is performed early in the process. If a value other than a boolean is detected, raise an error before the SQL statement is constructed. This will preserve the integrity of the SQL queries generated and prevent potential database errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nThese specific points of intervention aim to enforce the usage of boolean values with `__isnull` lookups, aligning with the issue description's concern for consistency and clarity in the framework's behavior."
