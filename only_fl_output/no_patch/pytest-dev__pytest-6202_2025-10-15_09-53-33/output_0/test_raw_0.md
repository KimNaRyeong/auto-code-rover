Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to check for the specific issue related to the pytest report output and vscode-python test discovery error. The script is structured to run with pytest, checking if the test failure headline formats correctly when parameters include special sequences like '.['. The script prints a detailed stack trace if the issue is present, relying on the change prompting an `AssertionError` when the test headline is incorrectly formatted, and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed or not present.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pytest_check():
    test_content = """
        import pytest

        @pytest.mark.parametrize("a",["..["])
        def test_boo(a):
            assert 0
    """

    # Write test to a temporary file
    test_filename = 'temp_test.py'
    with open(test_filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(test_content)
    
    # Run pytest with the test
    result = subprocess.run(['pytest', test_filename], capture_output=True, text=True)
    
    # Check for incorrectly formatted failure headline
    if '..[' in result.stdout or '..[' in result.stderr:
        print("Issue not present.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        try:
            raise AssertionError("Failure headline incorrectly formatted.")
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # Exiting with non-zero code to indicate failure for automation purposes.
            # Change to zero if you prefer it to exit cleanly after reporting.
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pytest_check()
```

This script:
1. Generates a temporary pytest file with a parameterized test that should trigger the problematic output.
2. Executes pytest on this file and captures its output.
3. Checks the output for the correct formatting of test failure headlines. Specifically, it looks for the presence of '..[' which would indicate the problem is not present.
4. If the problem is detected (i.e., `..[` is not found in the output, implying that it was incorrectly replaced), it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace.
5. The script exits with code 0 if the issue is not present (i.e., it detects '..[' in the output), indicating the test passed and the issue is likely fixed.

Please note: Before running this script, ensure you have pytest installed in your environment (`pip install pytest`), and adjust the script if your testing environment requires specific configurations or paths for pytest execution.
