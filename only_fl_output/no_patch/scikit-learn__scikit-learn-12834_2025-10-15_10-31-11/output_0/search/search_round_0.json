        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should first gather more context about where and how ensemble models, particularly those mentioned as \"FOREST_ESTIMATORS\", handle multioutput scenarios, especially with non-numeric dependent variables (DVs). The steps include identifying the involved classes or methods where modifications might be required to support string DVs. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for mentions of the `FOREST_ESTIMATORS` to determine how and where it is defined or used. This will help identify which file or class we should focus on.\n   \n2. Since the issue is specific to forest estimators that can handle multioutput scenarios, it's also relevant to look at how the `fit` and `predict` methods are implemented for these models. The `fit` method, for example, seems crucial as it should be able to handle fitting models with string DVs, and the `predict` method should be able to return predictions for the same.\n\n3. The example test provided mentions `FOREST_CLASSIFIERS_REGRESSORS` which suggests there are versions of forest estimators tailored for both classification and regression tasks. Understanding how these are organized or implemented could be important for the fix.\n\n4. Understand how prediction probabilities calculation (`predict_proba` and `predict_log_proba`) are handled for multioutput string DVs. These methods might need adjustments to support non-numeric outputs as well.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's start with the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"FOREST_ESTIMATORS\")`: This will help us understand where and how the variable or construct `FOREST_ESTIMATORS` is defined, which seems central to the issue.\n- `search_method(\"fit\")`: Since the `fit` method is common to all estimators and is directly involved in training the model, including with string DVs, we need to understand its current implementation.\n- `search_method(\"predict\")`: Understanding the current implementation of the `predict` method is crucial for addressing the issue with non-numeric DVs.\n- `search_code(\"FOREST_CLASSIFIERS_REGRESSORS\")`: This will give us context on how forest classifiers and regressors are categorized or utilized, especially in tests."
