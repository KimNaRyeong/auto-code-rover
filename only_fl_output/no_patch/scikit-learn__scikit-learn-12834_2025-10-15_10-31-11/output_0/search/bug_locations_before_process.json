This involves preserving the string labels through the prediction aggregation process, including ensuring any class label encoding/decoding mechanism supports non-numeric labels correctly in a multi-output context. The existing functionality to predict class labels based on the highest mean probability estimate across trees should be maintained, but it must also correctly handle and return string labels as part of the output."

        "intended_behavior": "While not directly mentioned in the results, this method is involved in processing the target variable `y` and might be relevant to ensuring string labels are handled correctly, particularly in relation to class weights. The method should validate and process class weights for multi-output scenarios with string labels without assuming the labels are numeric. If string DVs are causing issues because of class weight computation or validation, adjustments should be made to accommodate string labels, ensuring that class weight functionality is preserved for numeric labels while being correctly applied to string labels as well."
