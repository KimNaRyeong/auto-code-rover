This suggests that the object initialization might be happening via the `__new__` method, which is a common pattern for immutable types or types that require control over their instantiation process in Python, especially in complex libraries like SymPy.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Permutation` class seems to represent mathematical permutations with various operations and properties related to permutations, such as computing cyclic forms, handling multiplications (compositions of permutations), computing inversions, and possibly more that relate to permutation properties like parity, signatures, etc.\n   \n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the issue mentions a constructor (`Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])`) issue with non-disjoint cycles, and considering there's no explicit `__init__` method, the instantiation logic inside the `__new__` method or any method that handles initialization or conversion from cycles to the permutation's internal representation is directly related to the bug.\n   - Since permutations are apparently supposed to be applied in a left-to-right order when cycles are not disjoint, the issue likely stems from how these cycles are interpreted and combined during the instantiation process.\n   \n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for the `Permutation` class to correctly handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in the specified order and creating the resulting permutation correctly, which in the case of `[[0,1],[0,1]]` would effectively be the identity permutation (where no elements are moved).\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, we should look into how the `Permutation` class instances are created and understand the logic for handling the cycle arguments passed to it. Since the `__init__` method isn't used for this purpose, I will now search for the `__new__` method implementation details and any related methods that might process the cycles into the internal permutation representation:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\")` - This will provide insights into the object instantiation process, especially how cycle inputs are interpreted and processed during object creation.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"cyclic_form\", \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\")` - Since the cyclic form is likely relevant to how non-disjoint cycles are handled, examining this method could provide additional insights into where the issue might be stemming from."
