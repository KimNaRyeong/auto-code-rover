This is a standalone Python script designed to reproduce the described performance issue. When ran in the context of a Django project (`python3 reproducer.py`), it executes a performance test on the existing `django.forms.widgets.Media` class by simulating the situation described in the issue report.

The script attempts to detect a significant delay in execution time when a large number of `Media` objects are concatenated. It uses an assertion to check if the operation completes within a reasonable time frame (in this case, arbitrarily chosen as 10 seconds, which you might need to adjust based on expected outcomes and the specific problem's nature). If the code takes longer, indicating the performance issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError` that is caught, and a stack trace is printed with specific line numbers for clarity, before exiting with code 1. If the issue is not detected and performance is within acceptable limits, the script exits gracefully with code 0, signaling no issue detected with the performance of `Media.__add__`. 

**Note:** This script requires Django to be installed and configured properly within the project where it's executed. The arbitrary assertion threshold might need adjustments based on expected or acceptable performance targets.
