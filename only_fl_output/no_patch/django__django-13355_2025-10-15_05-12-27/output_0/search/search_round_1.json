        "content": "<issue>Optimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(Media)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\ndef __add__(self, other):\ncombined = CustomMedia()\nif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\nelse:\ncombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\nif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\nelse:\ncombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\nreturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n</issue>"

The `__add__` method specifically combines the media defined in two `Media` instances, effectively appending the CSS and JavaScript lists of one `Media` instance to another. This operation allows form widgets to accumulate their media requirements dynamically.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The performance issue reported seems to stem directly from this `__add__` method. When a large number of `Media` objects are concatenated (100,000 instances in the test case), the method's efficiency drops significantly, leading to long page load times. The issue lies in how the addition operation is handled: since it directly appends lists (`self._css_lists + other._css_lists`, `self._js_lists + other._js_lists`), the operation becomes increasingly inefficient as the lists grow larger. \n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior, particularly after considering the performance concerns raised, would be to efficiently handle the concatenation of large numbers of `Media` objects without significantly degrading performance. An optimized approach should likely introduce a more efficient list handling or merging strategy, especially when the lists' sizes surpass a certain threshold.\n\n### CustomMedia Class\n\nSince the `CustomMedia` class was not found in the codebase, it is evident that the proposed solution in the issue description does not already exist within the project. The mention of `CustomMedia` implies introducing a derived class that could override the `__add__` method to incorporate optimizations\u2014specifically, limiting the total number of items processed to mitigate performance degradation.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the findings:\n\n- The `Media` class and its `__add__` method are central to the performance issue.\n- The `CustomMedia` class does not exist, yet it represents a proposed partial solution to address the performance concerns.\n\nThe next steps should involve further analysis and probably testification of the proposed `CustomMedia` optimization within `django/forms/widgets.py`. Specifically:\n\n1. Reviewing how `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` are structured and considering if their handling can be optimized, as suggested by the makeshift `CustomMedia` solution.\n2. Exploring alternative data structures or methodologies for concatenating these lists more efficiently, keeping the threshold idea in mind to avoid performance pitfalls.\n3. Since `CustomMedia` does not exist, creating a prototype based on the issue's description or developing a patch directly within the `Media` class might be necessary. This should especially focus on addressing efficiency when handling large numbers of additions.\n\nGiven the detailed information from the initial analysis, it is now crucial to draft a solution that tackles these performance issues. The next step would involve adjusting the `__add__` method implementation to incorporate a more efficient concatenation logic, possibly with safeguards or optimizations for handling large numbers of media objects."

To resolve the issue, this method should be optimized to handle large numbers of object additions without significant performance degradation. An optimization strategy could involve:\n   - Implementing a check to limit the size or total number of items in the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` when they are being combined, as suggested by the makeshift `CustomMedia` example in the issue description. When the combined length of `_css_lists` or `_js_lists` from both `Media` instances exceeds a certain threshold, a more efficient data structure or merging strategy should be employed.\n   - Preserving the current functionality where the method returns a new `Media` instance that combines the resources from both operands. However, the internal implementation must manage resource lists more effectively, potentially by delaying the actual concatenation until it is necessary (e.g., by maintaining a list of lists and flattening them on demand) or by switching to a data structure that supports efficient appending.\n   \n   The goal is to ensure that the `__add__` method can scale with a large number of `.css` and `.js` files without leading to the performance issues currently observed, thereby maintaining or enhancing the page load times regardless of the number of `Media` objects being combined."
