        "intended_behavior": "The `__add__` method in the `Media` class is intended to efficiently merge the CSS and JS resources from two `Media` instances. To resolve the issue, this method should be optimized to handle large numbers of object additions without significant performance degradation. An optimization strategy could involve: Implementing a check to limit the size or total number of items in the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` when they are being combined, as suggested by the makeshift `CustomMedia` example in the issue description. When the combined length of `_css_lists` or `_js_lists` from both `Media` instances exceeds a certain threshold, a more efficient data structure or merging strategy should be employed. Preserving the current functionality where the method returns a new `Media` instance that combines the resources from both operands. However, the internal implementation must manage resource lists more effectively, potentially by delaying the actual concatenation until it is necessary (e.g., by maintaining a list of lists and flattening them on demand) or by switching to a data structure that supports efficient appending. The goal is to ensure that the `__add__` method can scale with a large number of `.css` and `.js` files without leading to the performance issues currently observed, thereby maintaining or enhancing the page load times regardless of the number of `Media` objects being combined."
