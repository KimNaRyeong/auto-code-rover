Here are some API calls that would provide relevant information:\n\n1. **To understand how `execute_from_command_line` is implemented and referenced:**\n   - `search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")`\n\n2. **To get more insight into how entry points are defined in Django for the `django-admin` command:**\n   - `search_code(\"entry_points={'console_scripts': ['django-admin = django.core.management:execute_from_command_line',]}\")`\n   - `search_code(\"scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']\")`\n\n3. **To examine the Django `setup.py` file where the installation scripts and entry points are specified:**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"entry_points={'console_scripts':\", \"setup.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']\", \"setup.py\")`\n\nThese searches will help us collect enough context related to how both `django-admin` and `django-admin.py` are integrated into the Django framework, and why there might be redundancy in their installation."
