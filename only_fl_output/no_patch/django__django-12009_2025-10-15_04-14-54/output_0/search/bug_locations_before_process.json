        "intended_behavior": "Modify the setup configuration to ensure only one script is installed for `django-admin` functionality. This would likely involve choosing between using the `entry_points` approach to create a `django-admin` command without the `.py` extension, or directly installing a script. Favoring the `entry_points` mechanism would be advisable, as it is more robust and cross-platform. This change intends to eliminate redundancy while preserving the full functionality of Django's command-line interface."
