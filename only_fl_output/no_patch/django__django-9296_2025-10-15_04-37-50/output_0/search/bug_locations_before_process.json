        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method `__iter__` within the `Paginator` class. This method should iterate through the `page_range` of the paginator, yielding each page as it goes. This will make iterating over paginated querysets or lists more natural and integrate seamlessly with Python's iterator protocol. The implementation of this method should leverage the existing `page` method to fetch and yield each page accordingly, providing a straightforward way for users to iterate over pages without having to manually loop through `page_range` and call `page(page_num)` for each iteration. This enhancement aligns with Python's design philosophy of simple, readable, and intuitive interfaces, and fills the gap in the Paginator's functionality by adding iterator support, thus preserving the existing functionality while extending its usability."
