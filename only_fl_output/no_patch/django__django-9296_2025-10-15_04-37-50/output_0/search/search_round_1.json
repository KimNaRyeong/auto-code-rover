        "content": "The collected context from the `Paginator` class within Django's codebase provides significant insights into how we can approach the described issue. Let's break down the analysis based on the results.\n\n### 1. Paginator Class Overview\n\nThe `Paginator` class is designed to manage paginated data. It takes an `object_list` and divides it into pages, each containing a certain number of items (`per_page`). The class provides several methods to interact with the paginated data, like `validate_number` to validate a page number, `get_page` for fetching a page while handling invalid page numbers gracefully, `page` for fetching a page (raising an exception if the page number is out of range), and a few others for internal usage and properties like `count`, `num_pages`, and `page_range`.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Purpose of Existing Code**: \n   - The purpose of the `page` method is to return a `Page` object for a given page number, essentially slicing the `object_list` into a page-sized chunk of items.\n   - The `page_range` property returns a range object that represents the 1-based page numbers available, making it easy to iterate over all pages in a template for loop.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue**:\n   - The issue suggests adding an `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class to allow natural Pythonic iteration over the pages of a paginated list, instead of having to manually iterate over `page_range` and then fetching each page with `page(page_num)`.\n   - Currently, the Paginator class does not implement an `__iter__` method directly, requiring users to manually iterate over `page_range` and fetch each page.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior, as suggested by the issue, is to implement an `__iter__` method that internally iterates over `page_range` and yields each page using the `page(number)` method. This enhancement would provide a more intuitive interface for iterating through paginated results, aligning with typical Python collection iteration patterns.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the issue description and the analyzed implementation details of the `Paginator` class, adding the `__iter__` method would substantially improve usability by allowing users to iterate over paginated data in a more straightforward and Pythonic way, making the pagination process seamless and integrating better with Python's iteration protocols. The relationship between this enhancement and the current implementation lies in leveraging existing mechanisms (`page_range` and `page`) in a more intuitive interface."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Bug locations:\n   - **Location 1**: File: django/core/paginator.py, Class: Paginator\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Implement a new method `__iter__` within the `Paginator` class. This method should iterate through the `page_range` of the paginator, yielding each page as it goes. This will make iterating over paginated querysets or lists more natural and integrate seamlessly with Python's iterator protocol. The implementation of this method should leverage the existing `page` method to fetch and yield each page accordingly, providing a straightforward way for users to iterate over pages without having to manually loop through `page_range` and call `page(page_num)` for each iteration.\n\nThis enhancement aligns with Python's design philosophy of simple, readable, and intuitive interfaces, and fills the gap in the Paginator's functionality by adding iterator support, thus preserving the existing functionality while extending its usability."
