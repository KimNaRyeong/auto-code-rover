It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:\ndef __iter__(self):\nfor page_num in self.page_range:\nyield self.page(page_num)\n</issue>"

Search for the `Paginator` class to understand its current structure and whether the `__iter__` method is already implemented or how it could be integrated.\n   - `search_class(\"Paginator\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue description suggests adding an `__iter__` method that iterates over pages using `self.page_range` and `self.page(page_num)`, it is also essential to look into the existing implementations of `page_range` and `page` methods within the `Paginator` class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"page_range\", \"Paginator\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"page\", \"Paginator\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of the current implementation of the `Paginator` class, as well as details about `page_range` and `page` methods that are crucial for implementing the `__iter__` method as suggested in the issue."
