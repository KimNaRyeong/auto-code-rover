        "content": "Based on the gathered context from the search results, let's analyze the `fps` function and the `FormalPowerSeries` class concerning the issue reported.\n\n### Analysis of `fps` Function\n\nThe `fps` function, as defined in `sympy/series/formal.py`, is the primary entry point for generating formal power series of a given function `f` around a point `x = x0`. It provides various parameters to control the expansion, including the symbol `x`, the point of expansion `x0`, and flags for using specific algorithms (`hyper`, `rational`, `full`).\n\nFrom the provided code, we can see:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `fps` function starts by trying to identify the symbol `x` if it's not explicitly provided (`x is None`). It checks the free symbols in `f` and attempts to proceed if there's exactly one free symbol. If there are none or multiple, it returns `f` directly or raises an error for multivariate series, respectively.\n   - It then calls `compute_fps` with the provided parameters and conditions, which seems to be where the actual computation or decision-making regarding the series expansion takes place.\n   - If `compute_fps` returns `None`, the original function `f` is returned; otherwise, a `FormalPowerSeries` object is constructed and returned.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue occurs when `compute_fps` doesn't return `None` or a `FormalPowerSeries` object but instead directly returns the function `f`, which can be a `Pow` object in the case of polynomial inputs like `x**2`. This behavior contradicts what a user might expect from reading the documentation, which does not indicate that `fps` can return anything other than a `FormalPowerSeries` object.\n   - This directly relates to how `fps` decides to handle the input function and whether it deems it necessary to wrap it in a `FormalPowerSeries` object or return it as-is.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, regardless of `f` being already a polynomial or any form that doesn't require expansion, `fps` should return a `FormalPowerSeries` object or a similarly behaving object supporting indexing and other operations typical for series objects, maintaining interface consistency.\n\n### Analysis of the `FormalPowerSeries` Class\n\nThe `FormalPowerSeries` class provides properties and methods supporting operations on formal power series, like integration, derivation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and truncation to a polynomial. This class is meant to encapsulate the formal series' behavior and representation.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This class serves as a wrapper around formal series, exposing methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the series, including but not limited to evaluating terms, integrating, differentiating, and basic arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue suggests that for certain inputs, an object of this class is not returned as expected. Instead, the direct result (e.g., a `Pow` object) is returned, lacking the interface provided by `FormalPowerSeries`. Without the consistency of returning a `FormalPowerSeries`, users cannot reliably perform operations expecting the interface that `FormalPowerSeries` provides.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to ensure that for any input acceptable by the `fps` function, a `FormalPowerSeries` object (or an object with a compatible interface) is always returned. This would involve either adjusting the decision logic within the `fps` function to encapsulate such polynomial results within a `FormalPowerSeries` or introducing a new class or mechanism to accommodate these cases while providing a consistent interface.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nIt seems that a solution might involve modifying the `fps` function's return behavior to always provide an interface consistent with `FormalPowerSeries`, possibly by wrapping results like `x**2` in a `FormalPowerSeries` object or a new wrapper class designed for this purpose. Understanding how `compute_fps` makes its decision would also be critical, suggesting a deeper dive into its implementation might be necessary."

To achieve this, additional logic might be added to wrap the direct return values like `Pow` objects into a `FormalPowerSeries` object or another suitable structure that implements the same interface expected by users (support for indexing, arithmetic operations, etc.). This adjustment would ensure that regardless of the input's complexity or simplicity, the output consistently supports a predictable set of operations, aligning with the documented behavior and user expectations. The modification should be careful to preserve the functionality for cases that currently return a correct `FormalPowerSeries` object, only altering the behavior for cases that currently do not. This may involve checking the return type of `compute_fps` and wrapping it if necessary, before deciding to return `f` as is or as part of a formal series construct."
