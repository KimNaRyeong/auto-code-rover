        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we should first locate the `_mathtext_data.py` file mentioned in the issue description and then locate the `tex2uni` mapping or function, which apparently is missing some mathematical operations. Based on the issue, we can deduce that `tex2uni` is critical for mapping LaTeX commands to Unicode points for these mathematical operations. Therefore, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_code(\"_mathtext_data.py\")`: This will help locate the file path of `_mathtext_data.py` which is critical for the next steps.\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"tex2uni\", \"_mathtext_data.py\")`: Assuming the first call returns the correct file path, this would help us pinpoint where exactly `tex2uni` is defined or used within `_mathtext_data.py`. (Note: Replace `\"_mathtext_data.py\"` with the actual file path received from the first call).\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"tex2uni\", \"_mathtext_data.py\")`: This call is useful if `tex2uni` is indeed a method within the file. This might be redundant if the second call gives us all we need, but it's safe to check both method and general code. (Again, replace `\"_mathtext_data.py\"` with the actual file path).\n\nThese steps should give us enough context about where and how `tex2uni` is implemented, enabling us to consider how best to integrate the missing mathematical operations."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into how to approach resolving the issue:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The code snippet found in `lib/matplotlib/_mathtext_data.py` suggests that `tex2uni` is a dictionary mapping LaTex symbol names to Unicode points. We see entries like `'widehat'`, `'widetilde'`, and `'widebar'` mapped to their respective Unicode points (`0x0302`, `0x0303`, `0x0305`). This mapping is essential for converting LaTeX symbols into their visual Unicode representations in Matplotlib's mathematical text rendering system.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The reported issue highlights that certain mathematical operations (specified by their hex codes) are missing from this `tex2uni` mapping. The absence of these mappings would prevent the correct rendering of these symbols when Matplotlib's mathtext parser encounters their corresponding LaTeX commands. The issue directly relates to expanding this dictionary to include the missing Unicode points, thus enhancing the rendering capabilities for mathematical symbols in Matplotlib.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for `tex2uni` to include mappings for the additional mathematical symbols mentioned in the issue. This enhancement would allow users to use LaTeX commands for a broader set of mathematical symbols, which would then be correctly interpreted and rendered by Matplotlib's mathtext engine. This involves identifying the LaTeX command names for the provided Unicode points and then adding those new key-value pairs to the `tex2uni` dictionary.\n\nGiven this context and understanding, the next logical steps involve:\n- Identifying the LaTeX command strings for the missing Unicode points.\n- Expanding the `tex2uni` dictionary within `_mathtext_data.py` to include these new mappings.\n\nHowever, I should gather the current end of the `tex2uni` dictionary to properly integrate the new mappings in a format that is consistent with the existing code structure.\n\nFor this purpose, I would need to:\n- Use the `get_code_around_line` API with the file path `lib/matplotlib/_mathtext_data.py` focusing on the lines after the last known entry (e.g., around line 466 with a suitable window size to catch the end of the dictionary)."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Each new symbol requires identifying the corresponding LaTeX command and adding it to the dictionary in the form of a key-value pair where the key is the LaTeX command string (if such a command exists) and the value is the Unicode hexadecimal code of the symbol. This expansion preserves the existing functionality by simply extending the dictionary to support additional symbols, enhancing the capabilities of the Matplotlib's mathtext rendering engine. New entries should adhere to the formatting and structure of existing dictionary entries to maintain code consistency and readability."
