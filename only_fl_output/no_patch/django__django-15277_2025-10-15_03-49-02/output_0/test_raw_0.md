Before running this script, ensure Django is installed and configured correctly in your environment because the script relies on Django's ORM and validation mechanisms.
- Setting up a minimal Django project or having an existing Django project setup is required.
- Installing Django: `pip install django`
- Make sure to adjust Django settings appropriately, especially defining a `DATABASES` setting, even if it's just using SQLite for this purpose.
  
In a fully configured environment, running `python3 reproducer.py` with the underlying issue present (as described in the initial message) should raise an `AssertionError`, and print out the expected stack trace, showing that `y.clean('1', model_instance=None)` resulted in a `TypeError` due to a `MaxLengthValidator` trying to operate on a `CharField` instance initialized without a `max_length` argument. After applying the suggested fix, the script should complete without errors, demonstrating that the issue has been resolved.
