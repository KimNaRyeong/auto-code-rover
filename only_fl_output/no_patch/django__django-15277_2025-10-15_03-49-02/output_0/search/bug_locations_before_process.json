        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `__init__` method of the `CharField` class should be modified so that it only appends a `MaxLengthValidator` if `max_length` is explicitly provided and is not `None`. This change prevents the creation of a `MaxLengthValidator` when it's not applicable, thereby avoiding the TypeError and the performance overhead mentioned in the issue. The existing functionality, where `MaxLengthValidator` is added to ensure string fields do not exceed a specified length, should be preserved when `max_length` is properly specified. The conditional check should be as simple as wrapping the current validation append operation within an if-statement that checks if `max_length` is not `None`."
