Given your requirements, we will attempt to write a Python script that programmatically generates a simple Sphinx project and compares its output against the expected rendering of backslashes to reproduce the reported issue. We'll create an RST document dynamically, build it using Sphinx, then inspect the produced HTML file for the expected content. 

This script assumes Sphinx is correctly installed in the Python environment from which the script is executed.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
import shutil

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project(src_dir):
    conf_py = """
project = 'Sphinx Backslashes Test'
master_doc = 'index'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
"""
    index_rst = """
.. _backslash-test:

    os.makedirs(src_dir, exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(src_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(conf_py)
    with open(os.path.join(src_dir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(index_rst)

def build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir):
    subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', src_dir, build_dir], check=True)

def check_output(build_dir):
    expected_strings = [
        '\\', '\\\\\\\\', '\\\\', '\\\\\\\\', '\\\\\\'
    ]
    index_html_path = os.path.join(build_dir, 'index.html')
    with open(index_html_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        for expected in expected_strings:
            if expected not in content:
                raise AssertionError(f"Expected string '{expected}' not found in output")

def main():
    try:
        with TemporaryDirectory() as src_dir, TemporaryDirectory() as build_dir:
            create_sphinx_project(src_dir)
            build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir)
            check_output(build_dir)
            print("Test passed: Issue not found or already fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script follows these steps:
- Creates a temporary Sphinx project including a `conf.py` and an `index.rst` with the content demonstrating the issue.
- Builds the project into HTML format.
- Checks the resulting `index.html` for the presence of the backslashes as described. If the expected sequences are not found, an `AssertionError` is raised.

To run this, make sure Sphinx is installed (`pip install sphinx`) in your Python environment. This script assumes familiarity with Sphinx's basic operation and environment setup. Remember that Sphinx's output could vary with different themes or versions, and this could influence the effectiveness of string checks in the HTML content.
