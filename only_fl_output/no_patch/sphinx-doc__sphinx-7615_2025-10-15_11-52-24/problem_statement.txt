Sphinx, unlike Docutils, incorrectly renders consecutive backslashes
**Describe the bug**
Sphinx incorrectly renders four or more consecutive backslashes. In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.

**To Reproduce**
The following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering. 
```
Two \\

Three \\\

Four \\\\

Five \\\\\

Six \\\\\\
```

**Expected behavior**
Two backslashes should be rendered as `\`. Three still as `\`. Four and five as `\\`. Six as `\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.
