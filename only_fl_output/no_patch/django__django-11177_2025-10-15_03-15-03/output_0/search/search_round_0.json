It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and address the issue related to the Django 2.2 autoreloader failing intermittently, let's focus on the components involved. Given that the autoreloader's behavior is in question, particularly with Python 3.7 and Django 2.2, but not using Watchman, we need to look at relevant classes or methods tied to Django's autoreload functionality. Let's start by gathering context on the autoreloader mechanism within Django:\n\n1. **Search for the autoreloader's code or module** - Since Django's autoreload functionality likely resides in an internal module, we'll start by searching for anything related to the autoreloader directly in Django's codebase.\n\n2. **Investigate how files are watched for changes** - Django's autoreloader works by watching for file changes. Without Watchman, Django uses a different mechanism for detecting changes. It will be helpful to find out which classes or methods are responsible for this.\n\nGiven the information needed:\n- Search for classes, methods, or code snippets related to the autoreloader functionality.\n- Specifically, we are interested in how Django decides to reload when a file changes and what might cause it to miss subsequent changes.\n\nLet's execute the following API calls for a start:\n- `search_code(\"autoreloader\")`\n- `search_method(\"file_changed\")`\n- `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n\nThese searches aim to pinpoint the components directly involved in Django's autoreloading process, especially around file change detection."
