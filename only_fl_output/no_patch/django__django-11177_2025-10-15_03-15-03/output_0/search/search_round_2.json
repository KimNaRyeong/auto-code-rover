It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

Given that the autoreloader's behavior is in question, particularly with Python 3.7 and Django 2.2, but not using Watchman, we need to look at relevant classes or methods tied to Django's autoreload functionality. Let's start by gathering context on the autoreloader mechanism within Django:\n\n1. **Search for the autoreloader's code or module** - Since Django's autoreload functionality likely resides in an internal module, we'll start by searching for anything related to the autoreloader directly in Django's codebase.\n\n2. **Investigate how files are watched for changes** - Django's autoreloader works by watching for file changes. Without Watchman, Django uses a different mechanism for detecting changes. It will be helpful to find out which classes or methods are responsible for this.\n\nGiven the information needed:\n- Search for classes, methods, or code snippets related to the autoreloader functionality.\n- Specifically, we are interested in how Django decides to reload when a file changes and what might cause it to miss subsequent changes.\n\nLet's execute the following API calls for a start:\n- `search_code(\"autoreloader\")`\n- `search_method(\"file_changed\")`\n- `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n\nThese searches aim to pinpoint the components directly involved in Django's autoreloading process, especially around file change detection."

        "content": "Based on the returned search results and the issue description, let's analyze the context we've collected:\n\n### 1. django/core/management/__init__.py\n- **What it does**: This snippet in `ManagementUtility.execute` function shows that Django's setup function is called within the autoreload check, which is wrapped in a try-except block designed to handle exceptions silently in certain circumstances. The `check_errors` function likely wraps Django setup calls to ensure that autoreload can proceed without immediately crashing if setup encounters errors.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Since the issue is with the autoreloader not picking up changes after the first change, this part suggests that the setup might not be the direct cause but could be related to how autoreload mechanisms handle errors or proceed post-setup.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the autoreload functionality should robustly watch for file changes and reload the development server consistently, even if previous reloads encountered issues. The error handling here should ensure setup errors don't completely halt the autoreloading process but might also need to ensure it doesn't interfere with detecting new changes.\n\n### 2. django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\n- **What it does**: This code snippet outlines the `run` function of the `runserver` command, indicating the autoreloader's involvement based on the `use_reloader` option.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The autoreloader's behavior is directly tied to this option; however, the bug seems to arise from its intermittent failure to detect changes rather than the initial use. This part of the code determines whether or not to use the autoreloader but not how the autoreloader tracks file changes.\n- **Intended behavior**: When enabled, the autoreloader should continuously monitor for file changes and trigger server restarts accordingly. Any inconsistencies in this process, like failing to detect subsequent changes, would be considered a bug.\n\n### 3. django/apps/registry.py\n- **What it does**: This snippet shows an `Apps` class initializer, which includes setting up a `ready_event` for the autoreloader. This indicates some form of synchronization mechanism, likely to signal when the app registry is fully ready and perhaps to coordinate with the autoreload process.\n- **Relation to the bug**: This part suggests that there's an interaction between Django's application readiness and the autoreload functionality. If the autoreloader depends on certain signals or events related to app readiness, any issues in this signaling mechanism could potentially impact its ability to detect file changes consistently.\n- **Intended behavior**: The `ready_event` should accurately reflect the application's state, ensuring that the autoreloader only acts when the apps are fully loaded. This should help in avoiding any race conditions or timing issues that might cause the autoreloader to miss file changes.\n\nGiven this analysis and the initial blank searches for methods or classes directly related to the autoreloading mechanism, it seems the next step should be to dive deeper into how Django setups and handles file change detection without relying on external tools like Watchman. Since we didn't find `file_changed` or `Autoreloader`, we might need to look at related mechanisms such as how Django uses threads or events for autoreload, or explore how Django's `runserver` command integrates with the autoreloader more deeply.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Investigate Django's threading or file watching mechanisms more closely.\n- Look into how `use_reloader` is implemented and what mechanisms it uses to detect file changes.\n\nPossible follow-up API calls:\n- `search_code(\"use_reloader\")`\n- `search_code(\"threading\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"run\", \"django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\")` to get more insight into the `run` method's implementation and any other related mechanisms it invokes around reloading."

        "content": "Analyzing the latest results, particularly focusing on the mentions of `use_reloader` and `threading`, as well as the specific implementation of the `run` method in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`, we can draw some conclusions relevant to the issue at hand.\n\n### Analyzing `use_reloader` and `threading` context:\n- The `use_reloader` option is a key component in determining whether to use Django's autoreloader functionality. When this option is set to `True`, the autoreloader is engaged, monitoring for file changes and restarting the server accordingly.\n- The presence of `threading` across various components, including the autoreload module (`django/utils/autoreload.py`), suggests that Django's autoreloader may rely on threading for its operation. This is significant because threading complexities can lead to issues with race conditions or missed file change events, which could explain the intermittent failures described in the issue.\n\n### Relationship Between the Code Parts and the Bug:\n1. **`use_reloader` in `runserver.py`**:\n   - **What it does**: Decides whether to initiate the autoreloader.\n   - **Relation to the bug**: If the autoreloader intermittently fails to detect file changes, it could be an issue with how `use_reloader` controls its activation or an issue within the autoreload mechanism itself.\n   - **Intended behavior**: It should reliably trigger the autoreload process whenever a file change is detected, ensuring consistent server restarts during development.\n\n2. **`threading` in various components**:\n   - **What it does**: Likely used for managing concurrent operations within the autoreloader and possibly for watching file updates.\n   - **Relation to the bug**: Problems in threading implementation could lead to inconsistent autoreload behavior, such as missed updates after the first change is detected.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Threading should be managed in a way that consistently monitors file changes without missing updates, possibly by ensuring that file monitoring threads are properly synchronized and managed.\n\n3. **`run` method in `runserver.py`**:\n   - **What it does**: Executes the server run, conditionally using the autoreloader based on `use_reloader`.\n   - **Relation to the bug**: Shows how the autoreloader is engaged and points to `run_with_reloader` as a critical function. If there's a malfunction or inefficiency within `run_with_reloader` or the decision process leading up to its invocation, that could directly impact the autoreload functionality's reliability.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Should flawlessly decide on the use of the autoreloader and engage it in a way that ensures consistent detection of file changes.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps:\nGiven the issue described, it appears necessary to focus on how `run_with_reloader` operates within the autoreload mechanism and to ensure threading issues do not hamper file change detection. Specifically, it would be beneficial to understand the architecture of `run_with_reloader`, how threads are managed within this context, and explore if there are issues related to thread synchronization or file monitoring that lead to the observed intermittent reloading problem.\n\n### Necessary Adjustments to Bug Locations:\n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`\n  - **Class**: `Command`\n  - **Method**: `run`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that `use_reloader` reliably triggers the autoreload mechanism. The autoreload process should consistently monitor file changes through efficient thread management or an alternative robust method to prevent missed or ignored file changes.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: Potentially in `django/utils/autoreload.py` (identified through context clues but not directly returned in searches)\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Investigation and possible refactoring to ensure threading or file monitoring mechanisms are robust and reliable, preventing intermittent failures in detecting file changes.\n\nTo resolve the issue, a deeper dive into the implementation of autoreload mechanisms, particularly around file watch strategies and threading, is warranted. This approach will help in identifying and patching the root cause of the autoreloader's intermittent failures."

This might involve verifying that the autoreload mechanism, possibly managed within `run_with_reloader`, efficiently detects file changes across multiple edits. The autoreloader should maintain a reliable watch on file modifications and trigger recompilation and server restart without fail. Any synchronization issues within the threading model used for file monitoring need addressing to ensure changes are consistently recognized.\n\n**Bug Location 2**: \n- **File**: `django/utils/autoreload.py` (inferred location based on context)\n- **Intended Behavior**: This file is presumed to contain the core logic for the autoreload process.

The intended behavior here is to enhance the detection mechanism (potentially by improving the threading model or file watch strategy) to ensure that every file change reliably triggers the autoreload process. Optimization may include better management of file watchers, ensuring threads are correctly synchronized, and avoiding any race conditions that could lead to missed file changes."
