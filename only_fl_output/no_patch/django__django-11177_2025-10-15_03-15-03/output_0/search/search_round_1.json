It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

Given that the autoreloader's behavior is in question, particularly with Python 3.7 and Django 2.2, but not using Watchman, we need to look at relevant classes or methods tied to Django's autoreload functionality. Let's start by gathering context on the autoreloader mechanism within Django:\n\n1. **Search for the autoreloader's code or module** - Since Django's autoreload functionality likely resides in an internal module, we'll start by searching for anything related to the autoreloader directly in Django's codebase.\n\n2. **Investigate how files are watched for changes** - Django's autoreloader works by watching for file changes. Without Watchman, Django uses a different mechanism for detecting changes. It will be helpful to find out which classes or methods are responsible for this.\n\nGiven the information needed:\n- Search for classes, methods, or code snippets related to the autoreloader functionality.\n- Specifically, we are interested in how Django decides to reload when a file changes and what might cause it to miss subsequent changes.\n\nLet's execute the following API calls for a start:\n- `search_code(\"autoreloader\")`\n- `search_method(\"file_changed\")`\n- `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n\nThese searches aim to pinpoint the components directly involved in Django's autoreloading process, especially around file change detection."

        "content": "Based on the returned search results and the issue description, let's analyze the context we've collected:\n\n### 1. django/core/management/__init__.py\n- **What it does**: This snippet in `ManagementUtility.execute` function shows that Django's setup function is called within the autoreload check, which is wrapped in a try-except block designed to handle exceptions silently in certain circumstances. The `check_errors` function likely wraps Django setup calls to ensure that autoreload can proceed without immediately crashing if setup encounters errors.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Since the issue is with the autoreloader not picking up changes after the first change, this part suggests that the setup might not be the direct cause but could be related to how autoreload mechanisms handle errors or proceed post-setup.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the autoreload functionality should robustly watch for file changes and reload the development server consistently, even if previous reloads encountered issues. The error handling here should ensure setup errors don't completely halt the autoreloading process but might also need to ensure it doesn't interfere with detecting new changes.\n\n### 2. django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\n- **What it does**: This code snippet outlines the `run` function of the `runserver` command, indicating the autoreloader's involvement based on the `use_reloader` option.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The autoreloader's behavior is directly tied to this option; however, the bug seems to arise from its intermittent failure to detect changes rather than the initial use. This part of the code determines whether or not to use the autoreloader but not how the autoreloader tracks file changes.\n- **Intended behavior**: When enabled, the autoreloader should continuously monitor for file changes and trigger server restarts accordingly. Any inconsistencies in this process, like failing to detect subsequent changes, would be considered a bug.\n\n### 3. django/apps/registry.py\n- **What it does**: This snippet shows an `Apps` class initializer, which includes setting up a `ready_event` for the autoreloader. This indicates some form of synchronization mechanism, likely to signal when the app registry is fully ready and perhaps to coordinate with the autoreload process.\n- **Relation to the bug**: This part suggests that there's an interaction between Django's application readiness and the autoreload functionality. If the autoreloader depends on certain signals or events related to app readiness, any issues in this signaling mechanism could potentially impact its ability to detect file changes consistently.\n- **Intended behavior**: The `ready_event` should accurately reflect the application's state, ensuring that the autoreloader only acts when the apps are fully loaded. This should help in avoiding any race conditions or timing issues that might cause the autoreloader to miss file changes.\n\nGiven this analysis and the initial blank searches for methods or classes directly related to the autoreloading mechanism, it seems the next step should be to dive deeper into how Django setups and handles file change detection without relying on external tools like Watchman. Since we didn't find `file_changed` or `Autoreloader`, we might need to look at related mechanisms such as how Django uses threads or events for autoreload, or explore how Django's `runserver` command integrates with the autoreloader more deeply.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Investigate Django's threading or file watching mechanisms more closely.\n- Look into how `use_reloader` is implemented and what mechanisms it uses to detect file changes.\n\nPossible follow-up API calls:\n- `search_code(\"use_reloader\")`\n- `search_code(\"threading\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"run\", \"django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\")` to get more insight into the `run` method's implementation and any other related mechanisms it invokes around reloading."
