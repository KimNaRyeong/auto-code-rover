        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` method should properly handle `MatrixSymbol` names containing special characters by ensuring they are either sanitized or dummified correctly when `dummify=True`. This means adapting the symbol replacement or name sanitization part of the method to account for cases where symbol names include characters that are not valid in Python identifiers, such as curly braces. The modification should ensure these names do not cause a `SyntaxError` when the lambda function is compiled. The existing functionality for handling standard symbol names, and the various modules (`numpy`, `math`, etc.), must be preserved while extending support for symbols with special characters in their names."
