        "intended_behavior": "This function should be able to gracefully handle `indptr` arrays of type `int64` without causing a TypeError due to unsafe casting on 32-bit systems. The intended fix should ensure that the reduce operation (`ufunc.reduceat`) accommodates `int64` indices safely. This might involve checking the system architecture (32-bit vs. 64-bit) and adjusting the operation to handle `int64` indices appropriately or ensuring that dtype casting from `int64` to `int32` (if it must happen) is done in a manner that does not lead to data loss or errors. The goal is to maintain functionality while ensuring compatibility across different system architectures."

        "intended_behavior": "While this method directly might not throw the error, ensuring that it correctly interfaces with matrices whose `indptr` is `int64`, especially after the adjustments made in `_minor_reduce`, is crucial. This might involve ensuring that any temporary matrices or operations accommodated within this method (as part of the min/max axis computation) are fully compatible with the changes made to support `int64` `indptr`. The intended behavior is to preserve existing functionality while robustly supporting operations on large matrices, especially on 32-bit systems. The adjustments made should ensure no data type incompatibility errors arise from operations involving `indptr`."
