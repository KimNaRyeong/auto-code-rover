Given the updated requirements and the feedback on the previous attempt, let's modify the approach with the necessary corrections to accurately reflect the file operation behaviors that could cause a `PermissionError` during the clean-up process of temporary directories in a way that mimics the original issue more closely.

This time, I will ensure all necessary imports are included, and the script more accurately represents an attempt to reproduce the observed `pytest` behavior under specific conditions that lead to a `PermissionError`.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
import time
from pathlib import Path

def create_temp_directories(base_dir, count=5):
    """Create a specified number of temporary directories."""
    for _ in range(count):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir)
        # Create a lock file in each directory to simulate the lock behavior observed.
        with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, '.lock'), 'w') as lock_file:
            lock_file.write("Locked for simulation")

def simulate_cleanup(base_dir):
    """Attempt to clean up the temporary directories, capturing PermissionErrors."""
    for temp_dir in Path(base_dir).iterdir():
        lock_file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, '.lock')
        # Attempt to access the lock file before trying to remove the directory
        try:
            with open(lock_file_path, 'r') as lock_file:
                # Simulate a delay in file access that could lead to timing issues
                time.sleep(0.1)
            shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
        except PermissionError as e:
            return e
    return None

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as base_temp_dir:
        create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir)

        error = simulate_cleanup(base_temp_dir)
        if error:
            print_stacktrace(error)
            raise AssertionError("Cleanup failed due to PermissionError.")
        else:
            print("Cleanup was successful.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
```

This script more rigorously follows the requirement to raise an `AssertionError` only when the specific issue of interest (`PermissionError` during cleanup) is encountered. It carefully sets up conditions that are more likely to trigger this specific error simulating a pytest-like behavior of working with temporary directories and cleaning them up.

Please note: 
- The occurrence of the `PermissionError` might still be influenced by specific environmental factors and timing related to how the operating system manages file locks and access permissions. As such, this script may not guarantee the reproduction of the issue in every environment.
- The delay introduced before attempting directory removal (`time.sleep(0.1)`) is an attempt to mimic timing or locking issues that could lead to a `PermissionError`. Adjusting this delay could affect the script's ability to reproduce the issue.
