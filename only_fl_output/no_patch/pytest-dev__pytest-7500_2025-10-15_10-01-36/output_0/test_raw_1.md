Capturing the exact issue as described with a stand-alone script might require a delicate balance, as the problem arises under specific conditions related to filesystem access and cleanup timing. That said, I'll craft a script that attempts to reproduce the issue more closely by mimicry of pytest's temporary directory cleanup behavior under load, as described.

Here's an adjusted `reproducer.py` that seeks to replicate the issue by simulating the pytest cleanup process, including creating temporary directories that pytest would clean up, and then intentionally creating access issues by locking a file.

```python
import os
import sys
import tempfile
import threading
import time
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, num_dirs=4):
    """Create temporary directories for testing."""
    for _ in range(num_dirs):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_temp_dir)
        lock_file = Path(temp_dir) / ".lock"
        with lock_file.open('w') as f:
            f.write("locked")

def lock_file_continuously(file_path):
    """Attempt to lock a file continuously to simulate access conflict."""
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        while True:
            f.write("locking")
            time.sleep(1)

def simulate_test_environment(base_temp_dir):
    """Simulate the test environment where the issue might occur."""
    create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir)
    temp_dirs = list(Path(base_temp_dir).glob("*"))
    if not temp_dirs:
        print("No temporary directories created.")
        return False
    
    lock_thread = threading.Thread(target=lock_file_continuously, args=(temp_dirs[0] / ".lock",), daemon=True)
    lock_thread.start()

    time.sleep(2)  # Wait a bit to ensure the file is being locked.

    try:
        for temp_dir in temp_dirs:
            shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=False)
        print("Temporary directories cleaned up successfully.")
        return True
    except PermissionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as base_temp_dir:
        result = simulate_test_environment(base_temp_dir)
        if not result:
            raise AssertionError("Issue replicated: Cleanup failed due to PermissionError.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script attempts to create a scenario akin to what was described, where temporary directories are created and at least one is being "used" in a way that could mimic a lock or open file handle preventing deletion. It leverages threading to keep a file in use, thereby potentially causing a `PermissionError` when the script attempts to clean up the directories.

Before using this script, please be aware of the following caveats:
- This script uses threading and file operations that may not behave identically on all platforms or under all conditions.
- As the original issue seems to involve timing and resource locking conditions that may be specific to certain filesystems, workloads, or system configurations, this simulation might not consistently replicate the exact issue on every system.
- Adjusting parameters like the number of directories or sleep times may be necessary to more accurately simulate the conditions under which the issue presents itself on a specific configuration.
