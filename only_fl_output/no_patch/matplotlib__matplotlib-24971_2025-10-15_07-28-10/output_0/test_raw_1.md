Given the error encountered in the last attempt due to the lack of the `skimage` library, I'll avoid using external dependencies not explicitly mentioned in the original post. Let's revise the test approach to make a more basic comparison between the two images using only `matplotlib` and `numpy`, which we know are available. The comparison will be simpler and based on the assumption that a significant layout issue would likely lead to a difference in the overall array shape of the images.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_layout_persistence():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)

    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.canvas.draw()  # Redraw the figure before saving again.
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    
    # Here we check for file size difference as a proxy for layout changes.
    size_test1 = os.path.getsize("test1.png")
    size_test2 = os.path.getsize("test2.png")
  
    return size_test1 == size_test2

try:
    assert test_layout_persistence(), "The layout persistence between the two saved figures might not be identical."
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
else:
    print("Success: The issue does not seem to persist or cannot be reproduced with this method.")
    exit(0)
```

This script simplifies the approach by checking if the file sizes of the two saved images are identical. It's a broader check and might not catch very subtle layout differences, but given the described bug, if the layout significantly changes from the first to the second save (enough to be noticeable), there should also be a noticeable difference in the file sizes.

This simplified test assumes that the original issue causes significant enough changes to affect file size. If the issue is extremely subtle (affecting only a few pixels without changing overall dimensions), this test might not catch it. However, for many practical purposes, if such a minor change doesn't notably affect the file's size or shape, it may not be considered impactful for users concerned with layout changes between saves.
