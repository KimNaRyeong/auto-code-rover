To create a standalone Python script that reproduces the described issue, follows the detailed requirements, and addresses previous concerns, please see the corrected and complete version below. This script makes a more methodical comparison between two saved images, and it includes necessary corrections, notably the missing `os` import.

```python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
    
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.canvas.draw()  # Explicitly redraw the figure before the second save.
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    
    # Compare file sizes to check for differences in saved figures.
    try:
        size_test1 = os.path.getsize("test1.png")
        size_test2 = os.path.getsize("test2.png")
        
        assert size_test1 == size_test2, "File sizes differ: The layout persistence between the two saved figures might not be identical."
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print("Success: No issue detected with layout persistence between two saved figures.")
    exit(0)
```

This script introduces necessary corrections, most importantly the inclusion of the `os` import required to check file sizes. It asserts that the file sizes of `test1.png` and `test2.png` are equal as a proxy for determining whether their layouts are indeed identical. If the layouts change significantly (due to the bug described), it's expected that the file sizes would also differ, thereby causing the assertion to fail. When the assertion fails, the script will print a stack trace pointing to the location of the failure. If there are no issues detected (i.e., the layout persistence bug is fixed or not present under these specific testing conditions), the script will print a success message and exit with code 0.
