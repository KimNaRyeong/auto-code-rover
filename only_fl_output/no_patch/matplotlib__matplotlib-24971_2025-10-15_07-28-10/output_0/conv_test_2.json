Under some specific circumstances (see below) compressed layout is not applied the second time a figure is saved.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\narr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))\r\n\r\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True\r\n\r\nfig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],\r\n                                  layout='compressed')\r\n\r\nfor key in [\"B\", \"C\"]:\r\n    ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)\r\n    \r\nfig.savefig(\"test1.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\r\nfig.savefig(\"test2.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\ntest1.png\r\n![test1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10599679/212073531-4841d847-29a5-45a4-aaa1-1d3b81277ddc.png)\r\n\r\ntest2.png\r\n![test2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10599679/212073574-f6286243-690d-4199-b6f4-4033e5d14635.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nBoth images should look like the first.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIf I do not set the `rcParams`, all is well.  If I do not set `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` in my calls to `savefig`, the images are identical (but I have too much white space top and bottom).  Maybe there is a better option than `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` when using compressed layout?\r\n\r\nFor context, my real example is a script that makes several figures.  For most of them I want constrained layout, so I set that once in the `rcParams` for convenience.  Only one figure needs \"compressed\", and I am saving twice because I want both a png and a pdf.  Fixed it in my current example by just reverting the `rcParams` setting for the one figure.\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nRHEL7\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.2 and main\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9 and 3.11\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"

        "content": "Given the error encountered in the last attempt due to the lack of the `skimage` library, I'll avoid using external dependencies not explicitly mentioned in the original post. Let's revise the test approach to make a more basic comparison between the two images using only `matplotlib` and `numpy`, which we know are available. The comparison will be simpler and based on the assumption that a significant layout issue would likely lead to a difference in the overall array shape of the images.\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_layout_persistence():\n    import matplotlib\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import numpy as np\n\n    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))\n\n    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True\n\n    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],\n                                      layout='compressed')\n\n    for key in [\"B\", \"C\"]:\n        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)\n\n    fig.savefig(\"test1.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\n    fig.canvas.draw()  # Redraw the figure before saving again.\n    fig.savefig(\"test2.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\n    \n    # Here we check for file size difference as a proxy for layout changes.\n    size_test1 = os.path.getsize(\"test1.png\")\n    size_test2 = os.path.getsize(\"test2.png\")\n  \n    return size_test1 == size_test2\n\ntry:\n    assert test_layout_persistence(), \"The layout persistence between the two saved figures might not be identical.\"\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    exit(1)\nelse:\n    print(\"Success: The issue does not seem to persist or cannot be reproduced with this method.\")\n    exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script simplifies the approach by checking if the file sizes of the two saved images are identical. It's a broader check and might not catch very subtle layout differences, but given the described bug, if the layout significantly changes from the first to the second save (enough to be noticeable), there should also be a noticeable difference in the file sizes.\n\nThis simplified test assumes that the original issue causes significant enough changes to affect file size. If the issue is extremely subtle (affecting only a few pixels without changing overall dimensions), this test might not catch it. However, for many practical purposes, if such a minor change doesn't notably affect the file's size or shape, it may not be considered impactful for users concerned with layout changes between saves."
