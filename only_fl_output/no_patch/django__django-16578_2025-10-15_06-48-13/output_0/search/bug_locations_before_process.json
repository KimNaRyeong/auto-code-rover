        "method": "__init__",
        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `__init__` method should be modified to only accept keyword arguments for `name` and `violation_error_message`, preserving its existing functionality which includes initializing a `BaseConstraint` instance with a name and an optional custom violation error message. This change should enforce the use of keyword arguments for greater clarity and conformity with the subclass implementations, ensuring that names and violation messages are explicitly declared when constructing instances, thereby reducing potential errors and improving code readability. This necessitates changing the function signature from:\n      def __init__(self, name, violation_error_message=None):\n      to\n      def __init__(self, *, name, violation_error_message=None):\n    - This modification makes all arguments following `*` keyword-only, adhering to the recommended approach and ensuring consistency across the Django codebase concerning constraint definitions."
