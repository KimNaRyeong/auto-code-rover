        "intended_behavior": "The method should first check if there's an ID specified in `self.data['attrs']['id']`. If this ID exists, it should be used as the return value of `id_for_label`, ensuring that the widget's label is correctly associated with its input element. This modification ensures consistency between the IDs used for rendering widgets and their corresponding labels, especially for widgets like `CheckboxSelectMultiple` that rely on precise association between inputs and labels for proper functionality. The change must preserve the existing behavior in scenarios where a custom ID isn't provided, defaulting to the current implementation of generating an ID based on the widget's name and index. This way, the existing functionality for forms and widgets not facing this specific issue remains unaffected."
