        "content": "<issue>Change PdfPages to default to keep_empty=False and eventually deprecate keep_empty\nPdfPages has an option, `keep_empty`, that sets whether a PdfPages object with *zero* figures is written to the disk at all or not.  This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides key insights into the implementation and usage of `keep_empty` within the `PdfPages` class across different backends (`backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py`). Here's the analysis based on the three questions posed:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **`PdfPages` Class Initialization (`__init__`):** In both backends, the `PdfPages` class is initialized with a `filename`, an optional `keep_empty` parameter (defaulting to `True`), and an optional `metadata` parameter. This setup controls whether empty PDF files are kept or deleted upon closing and allows for storing metadata within the PDF.\n  \n- **`close` Method:** The `close` method in each backend is responsible for finalizing the PDF file. In `backend_pdf.py`, if the condition of the page count being zero and `keep_empty` being false is met (and the file wasn't passed in as a file object), it removes the file from the filesystem. In contrast, `backend_pgf.py` handles the generation of the PDF file differently due to its LaTeX requirements but checks `keep_empty` similarly to decide on keeping an empty file.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue aims to change the default behavior of `keep_empty` from `True` to `False`, since creating empty PDF files contradicts the standard PDF specification. The mentioned parts of the code directly handle how `keep_empty` is interpreted and applied, determining whether an empty PDF file should be generated and kept. The issue suggests that this default behavior is problematic and needs adjustment to avoid generating invalid PDF files.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be:\n\n- **Change in Default Behavior:** The default value for `keep_empty` in the `__init__` method of the `PdfPages` class across both `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` should be modified from `True` to `False`. This means, unless explicitly stated otherwise by a user, empty PDFs should not be generated or saved.\n  \n- **Deprecation Strategy:** The issue also suggests eventually deprecating the` keep_empty` argument. This would necessitate a transition period where users are warned about the change in functionality when `keep_empty=True` could lead to the creation of an invalid PDF file, and suggesting that they adjust their code accordingly.\n\n### Next Steps for Implementation:\n\n- **Modify the Default Value:** The first actionable change is to adjust the default `keep_empty` parameter in both instances of the `PdfPages` class to be `False`.\n  \n- **Deprecation Warning:** Implement a warning mechanism that alerts users to the impending deprecation of `keep_empty=True` functionality, advising on the newly preferred behavior and encouraging them to update their codebase.\n\n- **Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation to reflect these changes and the reasoning behind them, ensuring users are fully informed about the alterations and their impact on PDF generation.\n\nThe next step in addressing the issue would involve preparing modifications to the `__init__` and `close` methods to align with the proposed default behavior and determining the most user-friendly method for implementing and communicating the deprecation strategy."

This alteration means that empty PDF files will not be kept unless explicitly requested by the user, adhering to the PDF standard that a valid PDF must contain at least one page. This change prevents the generation of invalid PDFs by default.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`\n  - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n  - **Method:** `__init__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `backend_pdf.py`, change the default value of `keep_empty` from `True` to `False`. This ensures that when using the PGF backend, empty PDF files are also not created by default. It aligns the behavior of both backends with the proposed standard and the issue's suggestion.\n\n- **Bug Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n  - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n  - **Method:** `close`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the behavior to reflect the new default of `keep_empty=False`. Specifically, this method does not need significant changes for the new default value but ensuring that it correctly interprets the absence of the file if `keep_empty` is `False` and no pages were added. The existing logic to delete the file if it ends up empty and `keep_empty` is `False` aligns with the intended behavior.\n\n- **Bug Location 4:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`\n  - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n  - **Method:** `close`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that for the PGF backend, the behavior of not creating an empty file when `keep_empty` is `False` is maintained. If `keep_empty` is `False` and no figures have been added (`_n_figures > 0` is `False`), the file creation/open statement (`open(self._output_name, 'wb').close()`) should be skipped to avoid generating an empty file. This change will need to consider the LaTeX handling specifics but ensure empty files are not unnecessarily created.\n\nThese changes will align the project with the proposed enhancement of handling empty PDFs according to the standard PDF specifications and preferences."
