To accurately address the issue regarding the `PdfPages` function from Matplotlib and its `keep_empty` parameter, we will craft a script that attempts to generate an empty PDF file with the current default behavior (`keep_empty=True`). Our script will verify the creation of such a file to demonstrate the existing issue. Consequently, it should fail (raising an `AssertionError`) when the issue is present—meaning the script creates an empty PDF due to the default behavior not being corrected yet—and it should exit with code `0` when the issue is rectified (no empty PDF is created when `keep_empty` is not explicitly set, assuming its default is changed to `False`).

This script assumes that the test is run in an environment where the necessary version of Matplotlib is installed, and it checks for the file existence to confirm the behavior:

```python
import os
import sys
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Specify the output PDF file path
    pdf_path = "test_empty.pdf"
    
    try:
        # Create a PdfPages object without explicitly using keep_empty
        # Assuming that future default is keep_empty=False, but currently, it is True
        with PdfPages(pdf_path) as pdf:
            # No figures are added to mimic the situation where an empty PDF could be created
            pass

        # Check whether an empty file has been created after closing the PdfPages object
        if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):
            print("Success! The empty PDF file was not created, adhering to the proposed behavior change.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed
        else:
            # If the file exists, it indicates the undesirable current behavior persists
            raise AssertionError("An empty PDF file was created. The issue persists.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if any other exception occurs

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue was reproduced successfully
```

This script selectively raises an `AssertionError` if an empty PDF is created, which would indicate the issue's presence. The decision to exit with code `0` post-catch in the final part, aligns with the instruction for indicating that the issue has been correctly reproduced. Conversely, if the behavior has been modified correctly (i.e., empty PDFs are no longer created by default), the script exits with code `0` initially upon verifying the absence of the file, reflecting the successful resolution of the mentioned issue.
