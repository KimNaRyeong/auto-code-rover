        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to correctly handle class-based views when used as error handlers, especially for `handler500`. To resolve the issue, the method's validation logic should be extended to consider the context in which class-based views are wrapped by the `as_view()` method. The adapted logic should recognize that class-based views inherently include an additional `self` parameter when their methods are bound to request handling. This does not misalign with Django's expectations for `handler500` when considering the operational context of class-based views. When `_check_custom_error_handlers` checks the signature of a `handler500`, it should first determine if the handler is a class-based view. If so, it should adjust its expectations to allow for the implicit `self` parameter in addition to the explicitly defined `request` parameter. This means that for class-based views, the method should validate against one explicit parameter (`request`) while internally accounting for two parameters (`self` and `request`). This enhancement would ensure that the system checks do not errantly flag class-based views used as custom error handlers as incorrect due to their inherent structural differences from function-based views. This approach retains the integrity of Django's error handling expectations while offering the necessary flexibility to accommodate the features and capabilities of class-based views, aligning with Django's design philosophy of encouraging the use of both function-based and class-based views depending on developer preference and application requirements."
