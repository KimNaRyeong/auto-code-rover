Specifically, we're interested in where the FormSet class is defined, how error messages are currently set up, and how they're raised.

Let's start by locating the FormSet class and any relevant methods or error messages involved in handling \"too few\" and \"too many\" forms.\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")` - This will help us find where the BaseFormSet class, which is what Django uses for managing formsets, is defined.\n\n2. `search_method(\"clean\")` - Since form validation typically happens in the `clean` methods, we want to see if there's a specific `clean` method within any FormSet class that handles this validation.\n\n3. `search_code(\"default_error_messages\")` - Because the issue describes moving messages to `default_error_messages`, it's useful to find where these might be defined or used within the context of formsets."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Result of `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")`:**\n\n   - The `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` is the foundational class for managing a collection of forms. This context shows that `default_error_messages` is already a part of the `BaseFormSet` class but only contains a message for \"missing_management_form.\" There's no mention of error messages specifically related to having too few or too many forms, which is directly relevant to the issue.\n   - The issue describes moving the messages regarding too few or too many forms into `default_error_messages` to allow overriding them via the `error_messages` argument when instantiating a `FormSet`.\n   - Intended behavior would involve adding those specific error messages to the `default_error_messages` dictionary within `BaseFormSet` to enable easier customization of these error messages at instantiation.\n\n2. **Result of `search_method(\"clean\")`:**\n\n   - Numerous `clean` methods are found throughout the project, including four matches in `formsets.py`. The `clean` method in a form or formset is responsible for the overall validation and is the likely place where checks for the correct number of forms would occur.\n   - The relationship to the bug is that the `clean` method of a `FormSet` might be where the logic resides for determining if there are too few or too many forms submitted. Modifying it or ensuring it uses the `default_error_messages` for these conditions is essential for solving the issue.\n   - The intended behavior here would likely involve ensuring that the `clean` method references `default_error_messages` for any errors related to the count of forms, thus respecting any overrides provided during instantiation.\n\n3. **Result of `search_code(\"default_error_messages\")`:**\n\n   - The `default_error_messages` snippets found across various files indicate it is a common pattern used in Django to define default messages for various errors, which can then be overridden by developers.\n   - This pattern's relevance to the bug is clear: following this established pattern for too few or too many forms in a `FormSet` will maintain consistency with the rest of Django's design and allow for the flexibility requested in the issue.\n   - The intended behavior would be to expand the use of `default_error_messages` within `BaseFormSet` to include messages for too few or too many forms, providing a consistent and customizable mechanism for handling these errors.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps for addressing the issue would include:\n\n- Modifying the `BaseFormSet` class to include additional keys in `default_error_messages` for \"too few\" and \"too many\" forms.\n- Ensuring that the logic within the `clean` method (or wherever the validation for the number of forms is happening) utilizes these messages from `default_error_messages`.\n- Reviewing the instantiation process of `FormSets` to confirm that the `error_messages` argument can override these default messages.\n\nFurther actions could involve:\n- Reviewing and possibly updating how the `FormSet` instances are created and how error messages are passed or overridden, possibly looking into `inlineformset_factory` as noted by the issue filer."

The keys for these messages could be named something like `min_num_forms_error` and `max_num_forms_error`. This will allow these messages to be overridden through the `error_messages` argument upon formset instantiation.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** django/forms/formsets.py\n     - **Class:** BaseFormSet\n     - **Method:** clean\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The `clean` method should be modified (or ensured) to use the newly added default error messages from `default_error_messages` when validation fails due to a number of forms being below the minimum or above the maximum allowed. Specifically, it needs to check if the custom error messages are provided through the `error_messages` argument and use them; otherwise, fall back to the default messages. This ensures that the functionality for a custom number of forms is preserved while enabling message customization.\n\nThese intended behaviors ensure that developers have the flexibility to define custom error messages for formsets directly, enhancing the customization and internationalization capabilities of Django projects."
