        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find where the `blocktrans` tag processing happens in the Django codebase and understand how it handles string formatting, especially in relation to the `TypeError` mentioned. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the method or function that handles the `blocktrans` template tag. This will likely be part of the Django template system, possibly in a module related to internationalization (i18n) or template tags.\n   \n2. Assuming the `blocktrans` tag handling might involve some form of translation string formatting, it's important to understand how Django's translation system handles string formatting, particularly with different types of values (e.g., floats vs. integers).\n\nBased on this, the following API calls will provide the needed context:\n\n- `search_method(\"do_translate\")`\n- `search_code(\"{% blocktrans %}\")`\n- `search_method(\"floatformat\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find the implementation of `do_translate` if that's where TypeError could be originating from, understand how `blocktrans` is parsed and handled in Django templates, and look into how `floatformat` is implemented since the issue mentions removing `floatformat` and casting the value as an integer works as a workaround."
