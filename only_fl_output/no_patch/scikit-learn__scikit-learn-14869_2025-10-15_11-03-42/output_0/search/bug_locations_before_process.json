        "intended_behavior": "The `_get_loss` method should incorporate a check to confirm whether the specified loss function is appropriate for the nature of the target variable (binary vs. multi-class). In cases where `categorical_crossentropy` is specified for binary classification tasks, the method should: Automatically set the loss to `binary_crossentropy` and issue a warning, indicating the switch due to the nature of the classification task. This ensures that the user is made aware of the change and understands the reason behind it. Alternatively, but less preferably, raise an exception alerting the user that `categorical_crossentropy` is not suitable for binary classification tasks, prompting them to explicitly choose an appropriate loss function. This exception should provide clear guidance on suitable choices for binary classification to improve user experience and prevent silent failures."
