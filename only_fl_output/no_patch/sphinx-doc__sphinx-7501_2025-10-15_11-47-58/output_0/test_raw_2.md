Given your instructions and the objective to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the specific documentation issue with `phpMyAdmin`, here is an example script. This script should be placed in the root directory of the `phpMyAdmin` project, following the structure provided in your examples. The script checks for the specific duplicate term case sensitivity issue in Sphinx documentation generation and uses the provided function to print the stack trace for debugging:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def install_sphinx():
    """Install the specified Sphinx version."""
    try:
        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "Sphinx==3.0.0"])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to install Sphinx.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def build_docs():
    """Attempt to build the project documentation."""
    if not os.path.exists("doc"):
        print("Documentation directory 'doc' does not exist in the current directory.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    os.chdir("doc")
    try:
        process = subprocess.run(["make", "html"], check=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        output = process.stdout + process.stderr
        if "duplicate term description of" in output:
            raise AssertionError("Duplicate term description error detected.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Documentation building process failed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error because the specific issue is present
    else:
        print("Documentation built successfully. No duplicate term description error detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    install_sphinx()
    build_docs()
    print("Issue not found or resolved, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if issue is resolved or not detected
```

This script performs the following operations:
1. Installs Sphinx version 3.0.0 using pip.
2. Tries to build the Sphinx documentation located in the `doc` directory of the project.
3. Checks for the specific error message regarding duplicate term descriptions in the Sphinx build output.
4. Uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function for any exceptions caught during the process, ensuring detailed debug information is displayed.

Please be aware that the script assumes that Sphinx can be installed and executed in your environment and that you have the required permissions to install Python packages. Furthermore, the script presumes that it's being executed in an environment where Python and pip are correctly set up and accessible.
