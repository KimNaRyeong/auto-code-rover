This will validate and prepare sample_weight for use while preserving existing functionality. The call to _check_sample_weight would ensure that sample_weight meets all necessary criteria for further processes within the method, thus maintaining the method's integrity and adhering to the library's standards for handling sample_weight."

This integration should replace or refactor explicit conversions and length checks currently performed on sample_weight. The key goal is to uphold the method's existing behavior\u2014managing sample weights during estimator fitting\u2014while encapsulating validation logic through the standardized _check_sample_weight, thereby improving code maintainability and alignment with project-wide handling of sample_weight."
