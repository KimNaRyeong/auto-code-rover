To create a `reproducer.py` that addresses the issue you encountered, I'll ensure the script checks for the presence of `pylint` in your environment and handles conditions appropriately, given that the previous attempt resulted in a `FileNotFoundError` for `pylint`. This revised script will try to execute `pylint` with different jobs settings and compares their output. If `pylint` is not installed or there are any issues executing it, the script will catch these conditions and provide a meaningful error message.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def pylint_is_installed() -> bool:
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(["pylint", "--version"], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        return True
    except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError):
        return False

def run_pylint(jobs: int) -> str:
    try:
        command = ["pylint", f"--jobs={jobs}", "--rcfile=pylintrc"] + TARGET_FILES
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return result.stdout + result.stderr
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to run pylint with --jobs={jobs}") from e

# Adapt this list with files or directories relevant to your project
TARGET_FILES = ["app/codein", "app/settings.py", "app/urls.py", "app/main.py"]

if not pylint_is_installed():
    print("pylint is not installed. Please ensure pylint is installed in the environment.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

try:
    output_1 = run_pylint(1)
    output_2 = run_pylint(2)

    if len(output_1.splitlines()) != len(output_2.splitlines()):
        raise AssertionError("Different number of lines in pylint output with --jobs=1 and --jobs=2")

    print("No issue detected. The outputs with --jobs=1 and --jobs=2 are consistent.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(0)
```

This script now includes a check to confirm if `pylint` is installed before proceeding with the comparison of outputs. It attempts to run `pylint` with both `--jobs=1` and `--jobs=2`, then compares the outputs by line count. If the line counts differ, it raises an `AssertionError`. If `pylint` is not found or any other issue occurs during its execution, the script will catch and display these issues.
