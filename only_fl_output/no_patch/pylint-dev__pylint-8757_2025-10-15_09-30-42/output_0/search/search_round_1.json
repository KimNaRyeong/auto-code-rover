Here are the API calls that would help in gaining insights into the potential causes of this issue:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions specific warnings and errors in different modules (`codein.callback`, `codein.types`, `main`, and `tests.test_utils`) with differing `--jobs` arguments, we should look into how these files handle imports and print statements.\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/callback.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/types.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"print\", \"app/main.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"print\", \"tests/test_utils.py\")`\n\n2. We will also need to understand how pylint manages parallel execution to hypothesize why the behavior changes with different `--jobs` values.\n    - `search_code(\"Linter.run_jobs\")` to understand the implementation of job handling in pylint.\n    - `search_code(\"Reporter.handle_message\")` to look into how messages are reported, which could be affected by parallelization.\n\nThese specific API calls are aimed at pinpointing how the relevant sections of code are structured, providing context for why different numbers of jobs might result in discrepancies in reported issues."

This could be due to several reasons such as changes in the directory structure, file names, or even the codebase itself has been updated or refactored significantly since the issue was reported. Additionally, there could be a mismatch in the search terms used, especially for the `Linter.run_jobs` and `Reporter.handle_message` functionalities within pylint, which could be implemented under different names or structures.\n\nGiven this context, here are alternative API calls or strategies we might consider to get more information and progress towards resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Broaden the Search for Parallel Execution Mechanism**: Since specific search terms like `Linter.run_jobs` did not yield results, we could broaden the search to simply `Linter` or even just `jobs` to find relevant pieces of the pylint codebase that handle parallel execution.\n    - `search_code(\"Linter\")`\n    - `search_code(\"jobs\")`\n\n2. **Search for General Implementation Details**: Instead of looking for `Reporter.handle_message`, which might be too specific or outdated, search for broader terms related to message handling or reporting in pylint.\n    - `search_code(\"Reporter\")`\n    - `search_code(\"handle_message\")`\n\n3. **Use Wildcards or Broad Terms for File Searches**: Given that the codebase might have evolved or the files mentioned might not be available under the exact paths, consider searching for elements of the file names or looking for key functionalities mentioned in the bug report.\n    - `search_code(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\")` to see if this import statement is being advocated for or enforced across the codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"print statement used\")` to identify where such a rule might be implemented or checked within pylint, giving insight into how `print` statements are handled differently based on parallelism settings.\n\n4. **Documentation or Configuration Files**: Sometimes, clues about how parallelism is handled or how linting rules are applied and ordered can be found in configuration files or documentation within the codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"pylintrc\")` to check if there are any configurations that could behave differently under parallel execution.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue being highly specific to parallel execution altering output significantly, the key goal is to unearth how pylint's architecture handles parallel tasks and reports findings. The actual issue might stem from how tasks are divided and processed in parallel or from how findings are collected and outputted from different threads or processes."
