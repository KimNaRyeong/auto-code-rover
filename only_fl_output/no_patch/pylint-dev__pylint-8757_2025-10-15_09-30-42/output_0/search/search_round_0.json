        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the different outputs of pylint when using different `--jobs` settings, we need to focus on the parallelism mechanism pylint uses and how it reports errors for different modules. Here are the API calls that would help in gaining insights into the potential causes of this issue:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions specific warnings and errors in different modules (`codein.callback`, `codein.types`, `main`, and `tests.test_utils`) with differing `--jobs` arguments, we should look into how these files handle imports and print statements.\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/callback.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/types.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"print\", \"app/main.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"print\", \"tests/test_utils.py\")`\n\n2. We will also need to understand how pylint manages parallel execution to hypothesize why the behavior changes with different `--jobs` values.\n    - `search_code(\"Linter.run_jobs\")` to understand the implementation of job handling in pylint.\n    - `search_code(\"Reporter.handle_message\")` to look into how messages are reported, which could be affected by parallelization.\n\nThese specific API calls are aimed at pinpointing how the relevant sections of code are structured, providing context for why different numbers of jobs might result in discrepancies in reported issues."
