        "content": "Given the requirements and the previous interactions, I understand you need a standalone Python file that aims to reproduce a specific issue with `xarray`. This script will attempt to replicate the described problem involving `xr.where` with scalar arguments and `keep_attrs=True`, which is expected to raise an `IndexError` due to the bug encountered. \n\nHowever, if the issue does not manifest (i.e., the script runs successfully without exception), it will exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue (or that the issue has been fixed in the version of `xarray` being used).\n\nHere's how the standalone file can be written, including the stack trace printer function:\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef reproduce_issue():\n    import xarray as xr\n    try:\n        # Attempt to reproduce the issue with keep_attrs=True\n        xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)\n        print(\"Reproduction of the issue failed: No exception was raised.\")\n    except IndexError as e:\n        # If an IndexError is caught, then it likely indicates the reproduction of the issue.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"Successfully reproduced the issue with xr.where and keep_attrs=True.\") from None\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Catching any other exceptions to ensure that only the specific issue we're looking for is flagged.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"An unexpected error occurred.\") from None\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    reproduce_issue()\n```\n\nThis script checks specifically for an `IndexError` to assert the issue is reproduced. If another type of exception is raised, it prints the stack trace but raises an `AssertionError` indicating an unexpected error occurred. This ensures clarity on whether the exact issue was encountered or if something else went wrong."
