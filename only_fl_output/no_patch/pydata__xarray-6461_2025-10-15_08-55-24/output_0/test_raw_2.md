Based on the updated request and considering the previous misunderstanding, I'll provide a corrected Python script suitable for your scenario. To clarify, this script is crafted to reproduce an issue where `xr.where` fails when used with scalar arguments and `keep_attrs=True`, specifically targeting `xarray` version 2022.3.0 or any environment that might trigger this bug.

This script `reproducer.py` is tailored to execute within the project's root directory, aiming to automatically detect and respond to the problem by raising an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, or by exiting gracefully with code 0 when the issue is resolved or otherwise untriggered.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
        print("The issue seems to be fixed or not present.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An issue was detected.") from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

**Understanding this script:**

1. **Stack trace printing**: The function `print_stacktrace` provides an informative output for any exceptions encountered, helping diagnose issues with clear context.

2. **Issue reproduction attempt**: `reproduce_issue` uses `xarray` functionalities to reproduce the specific issue tied to `xr.where` call with `keep_attrs=True`. When the call behaves unexpectedly, resulting in an exception, the script catches this and utilizes `print_stacktrace` for detailed error visibility.

3. **Behavioral gating**: The try-except block is designed to specifically isolate the error condition. If the operation completes without exceptions, it suggests the absence of the previously reported issue, allowing the script to gracefully exit with a success status code (0).

4. **Error Handling**: The generic `except Exception as e` is utilized to catch all exceptions. While it ensures that any form of error leads to an assertion, for a more precise catch, you might consider specifying the exact exception type if known, directly correlated to the failure mode of `xr.where` (for example, `IndexError` or a more specific `xarray` related exception).

This script should be placed in the root directory of your project and executed with Python 3, demonstrating the intended behavior associated with the described issue and response mechanics.
