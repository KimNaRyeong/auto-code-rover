        "content": "To gather sufficient context for the issue related to `xarray` and specifically the `xr.where` function failing with `keep_attrs=True` when a scalar is provided as the second argument, we need to look at specific parts of the xarray codebase. Given the traceback, the error seems to stem from the handling of `keep_attrs` parameter or the way attributes are managed during the operation.\n\nThe error message points to a lambda function and the use of `attrs[1]`, which suggests a mishandling of attributes when they are expected to be in a list format. To better understand the issue and to find a potential patch point, we need to examine the code around the area where the error occurs and the implementations of `xr.where`, and possibly, `apply_ufunc` since it appears in the traceback.\n\nLet's start by examining the specific code area causing the issue and also check the implementation of relevant functions:\n\n1. Get the code around the error point to understand the context of the lambda function and the `keep_attrs` handling.\n2. Search for the implementation of `apply_ufunc` as it is mentioned in the traceback and seems to be closely involved in this issue.\n\n```plaintext\nget_code_around_line(file_path=\"unknown\", line_number=1812, window_size=10)\nsearch_method(method_name=\"apply_ufunc\")\n```\n\nNote: The exact file path for the `get_code_around_line` API call is marked as \"unknown\" because the issue does not specify the file in which the error occurs. In practice, the file path would need to be determined based on the project's file structure or extracted from a more detailed traceback. For the purposes of this exercise, if more information is needed such as the specific file name for the error, it should be specified."
