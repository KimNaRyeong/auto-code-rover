        "intended_behavior": "The code handling `keep_attrs` when `xr.where` is used, especially in conjunction with scalar arguments, should ensure that it correctly manages the attributes regardless of the input types. This includes scenarios where one or more inputs might not carry attributes in the conventional sense (e.g., scalars or non-xarray objects). The intended behavior should involve checking the type and structure of each input and gracefully handling cases where attributes are not present or are not applicable. The function should not attempt to access attributes as if they were guaranteed to exist in a list or similar structure without first verifying the inputs' nature. If a scalar is used, and `keep_attrs=True`, the operation should either default to not attempting to retain attributes (since a scalar would not have associated attributes) or should more gracefully fail or warn the user about the impracticality of `keep_attrs` in this context without resulting in an unhandled exception. Given that the traceback suggests an exception thrown due to a lambda function attempting to access `attrs[1]`, the logic surrounding attribute retention needs to be reevaluated to ensure it aligns with the diverse nature of possible inputs to `xr.where` and similar functions that may rely on `apply_ufunc` underneath. Preserving the existing functionality means ensuring that attributes from xarray objects are retained where applicable and fall back gracefully where not."
