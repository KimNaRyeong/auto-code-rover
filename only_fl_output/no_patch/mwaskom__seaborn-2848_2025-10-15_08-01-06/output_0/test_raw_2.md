Based on your instruction to create a standalone `reproducer.py` file that adheres closely to your requirements, I've slightly adjusted the code to ensure that an `AssertionError` is raised when the issue is present, and that the script exits with code 0 when the issue is resolved. The key adjustment here is to explicitly check for a successful execution, which in this case, is inferred when no exception is raised till the end of the plotting commands execution:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import seaborn as sns
    iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

    try:
        g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
        g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue=iris["species"])
        # Explicitly check for drawing the second plot to ensure map execution is complete without error
        g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)
        # No exception thrown till this point hence assume the plot is successfully drawn
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
    else:
        # No issues so exiting with code 0 to indicate the fix.
        print("No issue detected: Issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

Please make sure that your environment has all necessary dependencies installed, including `seaborn` and its dependencies such as `matplotlib` and `numpy`, since `seaborn` relies on `matplotlib` for plotting. The error message in your test indicates that `matplotlib` was not found, which is a required library for `seaborn` to function. Make sure to install these dependencies in your environment to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.

This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, printing the relevant stack trace to help in debugging. If no error occurs until the execution is completed, it will print "No issue detected: Issue seems to be fixed." and then exit with code 0, indicating the test for the issue has passed, implying the issue is fixed or not present in the seaborn version being tested.
