        "intended_behavior": "The `map` method should correctly handle the `hue` parameter regardless if it is numeric, categorical, or a DataFrame column. The method should ensure that the `hue` parameter passed to the plotting functions (like `scatterplot` or `regplot`) is processed in such a manner that it does not raise KeyError or TypeError when categorical data is used. This might involve validating or transforming the `hue` data before it is utilized by the plotting functions or ensuring that seaborn's internal mechanisms for handling hues (e.g., normalization, lookup) are compatible with how `map` is invoking those functions."

        "intended_behavior": "The methods for plotting that accept a `hue` parameter need to robustly handle different types of inputs for `hue`, including direct lists or Series from a DataFrame, ensuring that categorical data is handled consistently. If the issue is rooted in how these methods interpret or utilize the `hue` parameter when passed from `PairGrid.map`, adjustments should ensure that `hue` data is properly normalized and mapped to the color palette without causing exceptions. This might require additional checks or preprocessing steps for `hue` values within these plotting methods or a more sophisticated method of passing data between `PairGrid.map` and the plotting functions to ensure they receive `hue` in the expected format."
