To use this `reproducer.py`, you would save it in the root directory of your Python project and run it as directed using `python3 reproducer.py`. This script attempts to run the provided code snippet that should raise the issue in question if it's not yet fixed in seaborn version 0.11.1 or any version you are currently testing. 

The `reproduce_issue` function encapsulates the code that's expected to replicate the issue, and `print_stacktrace` function will handle any exceptions by printing their stack trace. According to the instructions, if an exception is caught, indicating the issue is present, it will print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError`. If no exception is caught, it'll print that no `AssertionError` happened, implying the issue might be fixed.
