Certainly! Below is a `reproducer.py` script structured based on your request. For this script to work correctly, your environment must have `seaborn` and `matplotlib` installed since `seaborn` depends on `matplotlib` for plotting. This script assumes that the version of seaborn has the potential issue around handling the `hue` parameter in `PairGrid.map`. Here's how a revised script would look:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import seaborn as sns

    # Ensure seaborn is at the version of interest
    assert sns.__version__ == '0.11.1', f"Seaborn version is {sns.__version__}, expected 0.11.1."

    iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

    try:
        g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
        g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue=iris["species"])
        g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)
        # Suppose the issue is fixed, there should be no exceptions up to this point
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        exit(1)
```

Ensure you have installed the specific versions of `seaborn` (0.11.1) and `matplotlib`. You can do this by running:

```sh
pip install seaborn==0.11.1 matplotlib
```

This script checks if the `seaborn` version is exactly 0.11.1 to ensure the test is valid for the version with the known issue. If the version matches, it proceeds to attempt to replicate the issue with the `PairGrid` and plotting functions. On encountering an error, the script prints a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the issue and exits with code 1 to indicate failure. Conversely, if seaborn's behavior changes in a future version such that it no longer raises an exception for this code, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.
