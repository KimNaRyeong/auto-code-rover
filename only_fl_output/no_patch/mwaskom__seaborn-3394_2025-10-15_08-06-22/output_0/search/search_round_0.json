        "content": "To address the described issue, we should focus on the integration and behavior of `pandas` (`pd.NA`) and `numpy` (`np.nan`) data with `seaborn` plotting functions, especially within the context of `FacetGrid` and the `lineplot` method. Given the tools mentioned in the issue, here are the API calls that might provide useful insight:\n\n1. **Search for the seaborn FacetGrid class to understand how it handles data with missing values:**\n   - `search_class(\"FacetGrid\")`\n\n2. **Search for the seaborn lineplot function to explore its behavior with pd.NA and np.nan:**\n   - `search_method(\"lineplot\")`\n\n3. **Search for how pandas.DataFrame is handled when plotting with seaborn, focusing on missing value handling:**\n   - `search_code(\"pd.concat\")`\n   - `search_code(\"sns.lineplot\")`\n\n4. **Inspect how pandas handles pd.NA vs np.nan, particularly in operations that affect plotting (e.g., sorting or any form of data manipulation before plotting):**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fillna\", \"DataFrame\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"dropna\", \"DataFrame\")`\n\nThese searches will help gather context on how missing values from pandas are integrated into seaborn plots and why the presence of `pd.NA` might reverse axis ordering compared to `np.nan`. Understanding these mechanisms will be critical in developing a thorough solution to the reported issue."
