This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

The focus would be on identifying and modifying the parser logic to ensure attributes do not interfere with the correct recognition of enum values.

This could include handling attributes by converting them into a readable format that can be documented.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - If `_stringify` is involved in converting enum declarations into a string format, an improper handling or misunderstanding of attributes (`__attribute__` or custom attributes like `JXL_DEPRECATED`) could lead to the described issue. The problem arises if enum values followed by attributes are incorrectly serialized, potentially leading to confusion between the attribute and the enum value itself.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would ensure that attributes attached to enum values do not interfere with the interpretation of the enum value name itself. Essentially, attributes should be recognized and possibly documented, but not at the cost of misrepresenting the enum value's name in the process. This means the `_stringify` function should accurately separate the enum value from its attributes in the documentation process.\n\n### `_parse_attribute` Method\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This method likely parses and handles attributes in C/C++ code. It might be responsible for understanding and extracting information from `__attribute__` annotations, such as deprecation marks.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `_parse_attribute` method is directly involved in parsing attributes. The bug description suggests that attributes attached to enum values are not correctly parsed, leading to enum values being misinterpreted. This implies that `_parse_attribute` might not be correctly distinguishing attributes when they are applied to enum values, or it erroneously incorporates attributes into the enum value's name.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior here would be for `_parse_attribute` to correctly identify attributes attached to enum values and ensure they are handled appropriately. This means recognizing the attribute as separate from the enum value, such that the enum value's name is preserved accurately for documentation purposes, without being conflated with the attribute. Attributes should perhaps be documented adjacent to the enum values but not alter their names or lead to parsing errors like duplicate declarations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the focus for resolving the issue should involve:\n- **Updating `_stringify`** to ensure it formats enum values and their attributes correctly for documentation purposes, preserving the enum values' identities separately from any attributes.\n- **Refining `_parse_attribute`** to accurately parse and separate attributes from enum values during the parsing stage, possibly by adding a check or adjustment specifically for enum contexts.\n\nNo additional context from the API seems necessary at this point. The next steps would involve modifying these methods in `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` to address the described parsing problem."

This involves ensuring that attributes do not impact the correct identification and documentation of the enum value itself. Specifically, the method should be able to recognize when it is parsing an enum value and appropriately separate attribute parsing from the enum value recognition process. Furthermore, ensure that the presence of attributes does not lead to misinterpretations that could result in parsing errors or inaccuracies, such as the \"Duplicate C++ declaration\" mentioned in the issue. This could involve implementing additional logic to detect the context within which an attribute is encountered (e.g., distinguishing between function attributes, enum value attributes, etc.) and processing it accordingly.\n\nThese changes aim to resolve the issue by improving the handling of enum declarations with attributes in Sphinx's C/C++ parsing utilities, ensuring accurate and unambiguous documentation generation."
