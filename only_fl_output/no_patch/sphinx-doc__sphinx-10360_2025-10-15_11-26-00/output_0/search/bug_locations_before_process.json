Ensure that attributes such as `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` do not alter the enum value's name during the conversion into a string format. This might involve checking if the code construct being stringified is an enum value and, if so, applying logic to treat attributes separately from the enum value name."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the `_parse_attribute` method to properly parse and handle attributes when attached to enum values. This involves ensuring that attributes do not impact the correct identification and documentation of the enum value itself. Specifically, the method should be able to recognize when it is parsing an enum value and appropriately separate attribute parsing from the enum value recognition process. Furthermore, ensure that the presence of attributes does not lead to misinterpretations that could result in parsing errors or inaccuracies, such as the 'Duplicate C++ declaration' mentioned in the issue. This could involve implementing additional logic to detect the context within which an attribute is encountered (e.g., distinguishing between function attributes, enum value attributes, etc.) and processing it accordingly."
