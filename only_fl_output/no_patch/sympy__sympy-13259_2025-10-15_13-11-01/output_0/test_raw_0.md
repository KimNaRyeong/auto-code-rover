This script reproduces the issue by:

1. Defining function `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` to print the stack trace of an exception including the line numbers and code context for better debugging.
2. Implementing `main()` function where it creates the problematic expression and its simplified version using `sympy`.
3. It then compares their numerical evaluations to assert that they should be equal. The presence of an `AssertionError` indicates the issue still exists; otherwise, it suggests the issue has been resolved.
4. In the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, the `main` function is executed, and based on the outcome, the script exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed or prints a stack trace and exits with code 1 if the issue is present or an unexpected error occurs.
