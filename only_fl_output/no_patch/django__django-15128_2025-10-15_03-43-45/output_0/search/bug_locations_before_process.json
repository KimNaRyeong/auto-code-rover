        "intended_behavior": "This method should be adjusted to handle the case where alias changes can produce overlapping or conflicting aliases due to sequential changes (e.g., T4 -> T5 and T5 -> T6). The assertion that currently triggers an AssertionError ensures there's no overlap between change_map keys and values, which implies aliases are expected not to be reused in a way that creates ambiguity. However, to resolve the issue, the method should be enhanced to: 1. Detect potential overlaps or conflicts in alias changes earlier in the process. 2. Use a more sophisticated system for generating new aliases that accounts for existing aliases in both self and rhs query parts, especially in OR operations that combine queries. 3. This could involve implementing a check to ensure new aliases are not only unique concerning current query aliases but also considering the combined query context."

        "method": "combine",
        "intended_behavior": "The combine method should be updated to more robustly handle alias and join combination, particularly for OR operations. This involves: 1. Improving how aliases are merged and ensuring that no conflicts arise from combining aliases from both queries. 2. Adjusting the logic that determines alias reuse vs. creation in the context of a combined query, ensuring that it correctly considers potential conflicts that can arise from sequential alias changes. 3. Specifically, when ORing queries, ensuring that change_maps generated do not cause overlapping alias changes which could subsequently cause issues in change_aliases. These adjustments aim to preserve the SQL generation integrity that Django's ORM offers while ensuring that queries involving complex join and aliasing scenarios continue to work as expected, especially when combining queries using OR operations. The solution should maintain the existing functionality for all other ORM operations, ensuring that no side effects are introduced."
