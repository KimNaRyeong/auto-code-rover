To create a standalone `reproducer.py` script that closely matches your requirements and works in an isolated environment, we'll adjust the previous script. We'll make it self-contained by leveraging Django's ability to run without a full project setup for simple model testing, and ensure that the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_project'` error is addressed by not relying on an external Django project settings file.

This approach involves configuring Django settings directly within the script, allowing it to run outside the typical Django project structure. Please note, however, for a more complex application or project, integrating this script into your actual project setup might still be necessary.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Q

# Setup Django configurations (minimal)
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',  # This script itself is treated as an app for model definitions
    ],
    TIME_ZONE='UTC',
    USE_TZ=True,
)
django.setup()

# Define models according to the issue description
class Qux(models.Model):
    bazes = models.ManyToManyField("Baz", related_name="quxes")

class Foo(models.Model):
    qux = models.ForeignKey(Qux, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="foos")

class Bar(models.Model):
    foo = models.ForeignKey(Foo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="bars")
    another_foo = models.ForeignKey(Foo, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="other_bars")
    baz = models.ForeignKey("Baz", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="bars")

class Baz(models.Model):
    pass

# This line is necessary for Django to recognize the models defined above
models.Model.check()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Running migrations programmatically (in-memory SQLite for simplicity)
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command('migrate', '--noinput')

        qux = Qux.objects.create()
        qs1 = qux.foos.all()
        qs2 = Foo.objects.filter(
            Q(bars__baz__in=qux.bazes.all()) | Q(other_bars__baz__in=qux.bazes.all())
        )

        try:
            # 'result =' is used to actually execute the query
            result = qs1 | qs2  # This should work fine
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("Failed on qs1 | qs2", file=sys.stderr)

        try:
            result = qs2 | qs1  # This is expected to raise AssertionError
            print("The script did not raise an exception as expected.")
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("AssertionError raised as expected during qs2 | qs1.", file=sys.stderr)

This script should be placed in the root of your Django project and run using `python3 reproducer.py` directly. It attempts to encapsulate the configuration, model definitions, and test logic entirely within a single file for ease of demonstration and testing. 

Please adjust the `DATABASES` configuration as needed to match your testing database preferences. This example uses SQLite for simplicity. If running this script in a more complex Django setup, ensure the model definitions match your application's requirements or are appropriately adapted.
