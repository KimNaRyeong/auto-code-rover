Let's create a corrected and functional version of `reproducer.py`, which addresses the mentioned issues and works as intended within a Django context. This standalone script will be designed to reproduce the specific AssertionError described, by executing operations that lead to the problem with Django's ORM system.

Please, ensure you have Django installed in your environment before running this script. You can install Django by executing `pip install django` in your terminal if you haven't done so already. This script sets up a minimal Django environment, defines the models necessary to reproduce the issue as described, and then attempts to perform operations that should trigger the `AssertionError`. It uses the `print_stacktrace` function to output detailed information about the exception if it occurs as expected.
