And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "For resolving the described issue, I need to locate the erroneous hint within the Django project. The description mentions a mistake concerning the hint provided when more than two `ForeignKey`s in an intermediary model of a many-to-many (m2m) field are present, and no `through_fields` are set. The error incorrectly references `ForeignKey` instead of `ManyToManyField` and mentions outdated information regarding `symmetrical=False` for recursive relationships.\n\nGiven this information, let's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. **Search for the error message**: Since the issue describes a specific error message, I'll search for a part of this message to find where it's raised in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"If you want to create a recursive relationship, use ForeignKey\")`\n\n2. **Search for ManyToManyField handling**: It's mentioned that the issue is related to the handling of `ManyToManyField`, especially in configurations involving an intermediary model without specified `through_fields`. I'll search for related code snippets to understand how `ManyToManyField` configurations are validated.\n   - `search_method(\"validate_through_fields\")`\n   - `search_method(\"ManyToManyField\")` \n\nThe first call aims to locate the exact place where the incorrect hint is generated, and the latter two calls are intended to provide context about how `ManyToManyField` relationships, especially those involving intermediary models, are processed and validated within the Django framework. This information will be crucial for crafting a suitable patch."
