Based on your requirements, here's a corrected and focused version of the `reproducer.py` script. This script will directly address the issue observed in the test described, specifically aiming to reproduce the `AssertionError` within a controlled environment and using the provided function for clearer stack trace printing. Please ensure that this script is run within the root directory of your project, and adjust the import paths if your local setup requires it.

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sys
    try:
        import os
        # Setting the environment variable as instructed.
        os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'
        
        # Direct import inside the main function to ensure the environment variable takes effect.
        import sympy
        from sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse import test_issue_11230
        
        # Attempt to directly call the test function that failed.
        test_issue_11230()
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)  # Use the provided function to print the stack trace.
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate an error/failure state due to AssertionError.
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate an error state due to any other unexpected exception.
    else:
        # If no exception occurs, it indicates that the issue has been potentially resolved.
        print("No issues detected. Exiting normally.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Notes:**
- The script sets the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable at the beginning of the `main()` function to control hash seed behavior as per the issue reproduction steps outlined.
- The `try-except-else` block directly targets catching the `AssertionError`, which implies reproducing the issue successfully. It exits with status code `1` in such a case to indicate the problem. For any other unexpected exception, it also exits with `1` but after printing the unexpected error first.
- It is assumed that the function `test_issue_11230` from the `sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse` module directly relates to the test case that failed. Adjust the import statement if the location of the test has changed or the test function is named differently in your version or environment.
- Make sure the Sympy library and its dependencies are correctly installed in your environment where this script is executed.
