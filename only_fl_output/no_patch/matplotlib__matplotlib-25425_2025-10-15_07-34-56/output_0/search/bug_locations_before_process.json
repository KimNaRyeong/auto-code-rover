        "intended_behavior": "Modify the __str__ method to represent the AxesImage object using shape dimensions including depth when relevant. This means formatting the string to show dimensions similar to how numpy's shape attribute works, i.e., shape=(nrows, ncols[, depth]) for images with depth such as RGB(A). This adaptation makes the string representation more informative by including both the width and height, and, where applicable, the depth of the image data. It aligns with user expectations coming from a numpy background and improves usability and comprehensibility of the image objects' string representation."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method, get_shape, that accurately provides the dimensions of the image, potentially including depth for color images. This method should leverage the image's internal representation (likely stored in self._A) to return a tuple reflecting the image\u2019s width, height, and, if applicable, color channel count. This addresses the enhancement proposal directly by introducing a method with a numpy-consistent naming convention and functionality. It improves the API consistency with numpy and better communicates the capabilities of the AxesImage and related classes to the library users."
