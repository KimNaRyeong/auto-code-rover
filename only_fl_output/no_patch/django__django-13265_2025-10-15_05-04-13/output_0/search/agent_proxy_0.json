Given the described problem, it would be useful to:\n1. Find the implementation of the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation to better understand its requirements regarding the `_order` field generation.\n2. Investigate how indexes are added, specifically when involving the `_order` field, to understand if there's a sequence or dependency issue with `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`.\n3. Look into the `LookImage` model class to see if there is anything in its definition that could affect the generation of the `_order` field or if there is any custom handling in migrations.\n\nBased on the above points, I will perform the following API calls:\n- `search_class(\"LookImage\")`: To find the definition of the `LookImage` class for any custom implementation that could interfere with the migration operations.\n- `search_method(\"AlterOrderWithRespectTo\")`: To get the implementation details or usage of `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` in the codebase, understanding its requirements or limitations.\n- `search_code(\"migrations.AddIndex\")`: To see how indexes are typically added in migrations and if there's any pattern or practice to follow when indexes involve the `_order` field."
