        "intended_behavior": "The `translate_url` function should be enhanced to better handle URL patterns with optional named groups. When translating a URL, if optional parts of the pattern are missing, `translate_url` should not fail or revert to the original URL but should accurately construct the translated URL using the provided segments. This might involve adjusting the logic that constructs `to_be_reversed` or how `match.args` and `match.kwargs` are used with the `reverse` function, ensuring that it accounts for optional parameters and assembles the URL accordingly. The function must preserve its original functionality of translating URLs with mandatory segments while extending support for patterns that include optional segments."
