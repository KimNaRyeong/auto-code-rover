This `reproducer.py` script aims to reproduce the issue outlined with displaying the squared `LambertW` function in JupyterLab but executed in a standalone Python environment. It includes an assertion to fail if the operation unexpectedly succeeds, signifying the absence of the anticipated issue. The custom `print_stacktrace` function conveniently formats and prints the stack trace for any encountered exception, aiding in understanding the error's context. The script is devised to exit with code 0 if it successfully encounters and replicates the reported problem, as directed.
