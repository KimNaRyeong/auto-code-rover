        "intended_behavior": "The method should gracefully handle cases where the base of the power expression is a special function (such as LambertW) that does not accept the 'exp' keyword argument. Instead of directly passing 'exp=self._print(expr.exp)' as an argument to '_print' method of the base function, a check should be performed to determine if the base function's print method can accept an 'exp' keyword. If not, the method could manually format the expression with the base and exponent separately, ensuring compatibility with all function types including those that do not expect an 'exp' keyword argument. This preserves the existing functionality for other expressions while extending support for function bases like LambertW."

        "method": "_print_LambertW",
        "intended_behavior": "While the method itself is not buggy in its current implementation, extending it to optionally accept an 'exp' keyword argument (and ignore it or handle it if pertinent) could be a solution. However, based on the analysis, a modification to '_print_Pow' seems to be a more appropriate fix to address the issue at its root. This note is for completeness, suggesting that if a broader redesign is considered, methods like '_print_LambertW' might be adapted to uniformly handle additional formatting options like exponentiation."
