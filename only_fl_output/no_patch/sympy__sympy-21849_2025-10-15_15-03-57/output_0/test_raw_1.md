Based on your instructions and the earlier mistake, let's adjust the approach to correctly trigger and handle the expected error within the `reproducer.py` script. Given the initial issue is specific about the display mechanism within JupyterLab's environment, which may not directly translate outside of it, we'll simulate the conditions as closely as possible by invoking a similar display functionality programmatically:

```python
def main():
    import sympy as sp

    try:
        function = sp.Pow(sp.LambertW(2), 2)  # Using Pow to replicate the issue precisely
        
        # Simulating the rendering process in a Jupyter environment by converting to LaTeX
        latex_representation = sp.printing.latex(function) 
        print("Latex representation:", latex_representation)  # Normally, this would be where Jupyter tries to render it

        # If the rendering process succeeds without error, we raise
        # an AssertionError as we are expecting failure due to the known issue.
        assert False, "Expected an error when converting LambertW function squared to LaTeX, but it succeeded."
    except Exception as e:
        # If an error occurs, print the formatted stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    # Ensure to exit with code 0 to indicate the problem was successfully demonstrated.
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to directly target the issue by calling the `sp.printing.latex()` function, which simulates the rendering of the function to LaTeXâ€”one of the underlying processes used by JupyterLab when displaying equations. The error handling and exit logic have been adjusted based on the corrected understanding of your requirements.
