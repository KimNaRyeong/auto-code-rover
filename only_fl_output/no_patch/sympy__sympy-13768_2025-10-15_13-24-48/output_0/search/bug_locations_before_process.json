        "intended_behavior": "The method should first check if either of the matrices (operands) is effectively 1-dimensional (i.e., having a shape of either 1 x m or n x 1). If not, it should raise an error noting that one of the operands does not meet the dimension requirement for a dot product. This behavior ensures that operations that are mathematically undefined or unintended do not proceed, thus preventing the dimension mismatch issue. For cases where the dimensions are compatible, the method should carry out the dot product operation as intended, preserving the existing functionality for valid operations."
