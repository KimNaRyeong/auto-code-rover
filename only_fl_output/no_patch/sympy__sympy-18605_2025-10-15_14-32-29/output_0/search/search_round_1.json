        "content": "Based on the information retrieved about the `Idx` class from `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`, we see that the `Idx` class is derived from `Expr`, indicating it's a part of the symbolic expressions hierarchy in SymPy. It has properties related to symbolic indices, including integer nature, finiteness, realness, and others, which are important for tensor indexing and symbolic computation. \n\nGiven the issue reported, our focus narrows to the `__new__` constructor method, which is responsible for the object instantiation. The issue describes a problem where the `Idx` object incorrectly accepts non-integer bounds when a range is specified as a tuple, but behaves as expected (raising a `TypeError`) when initialized with a single non-integer range.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The constructor (`__new__` method) of the `Idx` class likely handles the initialization and validation of bounds for the index. It is supposed to enforce that the dimensions (including lower and upper bounds when given as a tuple) are integers.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The bug arises from improper or incomplete validation of the tuple bounds provided to the `Idx` class constructor. It indicates that the constructor's current implementation may not fully check both elements of the tuple to ensure they are integer expressions.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior would be for the `Idx` class constructor to validate that both lower and upper bounds (when specified as a tuple) are integer expressions. If any of the bounds are not integers, the constructor should raise a `TypeError`, consistent with the behavior observed when a single non-integer range is passed to it.\n\nTo pinpoint where the validation needs to be enhanced, the next step is to examine the `__new__` method of the `Idx` class more closely.\n\nI'll now proceed with:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/tensor/indexed.py\")"

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This validation should occur before creating a new instance of `Idx`. If either the lower or upper bound in the tuple is not an integer expression, the method should raise a `TypeError` indicating that `Idx` object bounds must be integers. This change will prevent the acceptance of non-integer bounds for the `Idx` object and will ensure consistency with the error handling mechanism already inplace for a single non-integer bound case."
