Locate the `_set_params` method within the `metaestimators.py` file since the traceback points to this method in `sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py`. This will provide context on how `_set_params` is implemented.\n   \n2. Find the `ColumnTransformer` class definition in the `sklearn.compose` module to understand how it utilizes `_set_params` and if there are any specific interactions that might be relevant to this issue.\n\n3. Look into the way `ColumnTransformer.set_params` is structured to understand how the error is raised during its call with no estimators.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"_set_params\", \"sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py\")`\n- `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_params\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`"
