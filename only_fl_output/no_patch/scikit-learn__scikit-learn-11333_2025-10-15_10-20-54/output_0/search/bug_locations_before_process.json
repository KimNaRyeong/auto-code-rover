        "intended_behavior": "The method `_set_params` should handle the scenario where the attribute it's trying to manipulate has no elements (e.g., an empty list of transformers). This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if `getattr(self, attr)` returns an empty list before attempting to unpack it. If the list is empty, the method should skip the problematic unpacking line and proceed to setting other parameters as usual. This modification preserves the existing functionality by still allowing parameters to be set on the composition object while preventing an error when the list of transformers or estimators is empty."
