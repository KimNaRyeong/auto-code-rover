To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the discussed issue, follow the given template. This script checks the behavior of the `_BaseComposition._set_params` method in scikit-learn when no estimators are provided. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists and will print a detailed stack trace of the error. Once the issue is resolved, it should exit with code 0 without any errors.

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # Attempt to set parameters on a ColumnTransformer with no transformers
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If no exception is raised, assume the issue is fixed
        print("Issue resolved")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # If an exception is caught, verify it's due to the discussed issue
        if "not enough values to unpack" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present")
        else:
            # If the error is different, it might be unrelated to the issue
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("A different issue encountered")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically attempts to set the `n_jobs` parameter on a `ColumnTransformer` instance that has been initialized without any transformers. According to the issue description, this operation triggers an `ValueError` due to trying to unpack an empty list of transformers. The `print_stacktrace` function provided is used here to give a clear output of the error's context directly before raising an `AssertionError` to indicate that the issue persists.

You can execute this script at the root directory of the project by running `python3 reproducer.py`. If the script prints "Issue resolved" and exits with code 0, then the issue has been fixed in your working environment. Otherwise, it will provide a detailed trace of the error.
