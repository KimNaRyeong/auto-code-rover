Notably, it allows you to filter the records by multiple values (if the field's value is one of the specified value options, then such record is considered matching).\nFor example, you can test it with a query string like this:\n/admin/auth/user/?username__in=johnny,viola,gordon\nUnfortunately, there is a big limitation at the moment: you can't include a value option that contains a comma (or a few).\nThe function that splits the string is prepare_lookup_value, found in \u200bcontrib.admin.util.\n</issue>"

Given the constraints, we should:\n\n1. Find out which file contains the `prepare_lookup_value` method because the issue explicitly mentions this method is responsible for the bug. This will require searching across the whole codebase.\n2. Obtain the code surrounding the `prepare_lookup_value` method to understand how it currently handles the splitting of strings and consider how it might be modified to support comma-containing values.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to locate the `prepare_lookup_value` method within the `contrib.admin.util` or a similarly named module, given the details:\n\n- Run `search_method(\"prepare_lookup_value\")` to find the method definition location.\n\nAssuming the module naming might have changed or to account for possible misdirection, if `contrib.admin.util` does not yield results or if the direct search for the method across the codebase is insufficient, we might need to broaden the search to include likely files or classes:\n\n- A broad search could involve `search_code(\"def prepare_lookup_value\")` if the direct method search is not productive.\n\nThese actions should provide the necessary context to understand where and how `prepare_lookup_value` operates, paving the way for crafting a fix for the comma-inclusion issue in Django admin filters."
