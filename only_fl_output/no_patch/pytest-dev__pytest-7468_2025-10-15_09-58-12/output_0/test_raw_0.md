Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. This script operates under the assumption that it's being executed in a project environment where pytest is installed and utilized. It tries to replicate the scenario presented in your request by attempting to use pytest with a log file path that includes a non-existent subdirectory. The script checks if the `FileNotFoundError` is appropriately raised when attempting to create a log file in a non-existent directory, which is the core of the issue. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace of the error. If the issue is fixed (meaning the directories are created as necessary), the script should exit with code 0 without an assertion.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Function to check whether pytest allows creating logs in non-existent subdirectories
def test_pytest_logfile_creation_in_nonexistent_subdirectory():
    log_file_path = "subtest/test.log"
    
    # Attempt to run pytest with the specified log file path
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(["pytest", f"--log-file={log_file_path}"])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Pytest execution resulted in an error, which might indicate the issue persists.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Pytest should have succeeded or failed due to reasons other than FileNotFoundError"
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        # If FileNotFoundError is thrown, then the initial problem is still present
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Encountered FileNotFoundError, meaning pytest did not automatically create the necessary subdirectories."
    else:
        print("Pytest log file creation in a non-existent subdirectory succeeded.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pytest_logfile_creation_in_nonexistent_subdirectory()
```

Please adjust the script depending on the specifics of your execution environment, such as the exact command-line arguments necessary for your use case. Remember, this script assumes pytest is already installed in your environment and it is being executed from a directory where pytest has permission to write files.
