This script operates under the assumption that it's being executed in a project environment where pytest is installed and utilized. It tries to replicate the scenario presented in your request by attempting to use pytest with a log file path that includes a non-existent subdirectory. The script checks if the `FileNotFoundError` is appropriately raised when attempting to create a log file in a non-existent directory, which is the core of the issue. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace of the error.
