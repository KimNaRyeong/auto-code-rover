Given the confusion and errors surrounding the previous attempt, organizing a correct approach and clearly specifying the desired actions is essential. The assumption here is to produce a standalone Python file, `reproducer.py`, that tests for the specified issue succinctly. Given the description and expected behavior provided, I am crafting a revised version of `reproducer.py` to reflect these updated instructions accurately. This script will focus on identifying the presence of an unintentional leading space in certain unit representations as described, by verifying the output of different format specifications for unit objects.

```python
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # List of unit representations to check for leading space
    units_to_check = [
        (u.m ** -1, 'unicode'),
        (u.eV * u.s ** 2, 'default'),
        (u.eV * u.s ** 2, 'unicode'),
        (1 * u.eV * u.s ** 2, 'default'),
        (1 * u.eV * u.s ** 2, 'unicode')
    ]
    
    for unit, format_ in units_to_check:
        try:
            unit_str = unit.to_string(format=format_) if format_ != 'default' else str(unit.decompose())
            assert not unit_str.startswith(' '), f"Leading space found in '{unit_str}' for format '{format_}'"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
    
    print("No issues found.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version aims to cover the scenarios mentioned, checking for a leading space across different unit formats (`unicode` and the default representation). When an issue as described (leading space being present) is detected, an `AssertionError` is thrown, with the script capturing and presenting a detailed stack trace for clearer diagnostics. Otherwise, it confirms the absence of the problem and exits gracefully.
