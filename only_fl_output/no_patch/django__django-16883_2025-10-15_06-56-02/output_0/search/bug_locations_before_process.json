        "intended_behavior": "This method should accept a single argument for the table name (type: `str`) and return a string that represents the model name derived from the table name. The default implementation should preserve Django's existing logic for converting table names to model class names. It should be easily overrideable for customization, and its use should be documented with examples on implementation."
