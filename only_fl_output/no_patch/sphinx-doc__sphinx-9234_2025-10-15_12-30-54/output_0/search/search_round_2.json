This suggests that the functionality related to link checking and redirect handling might be integrated into different parts of the project under different names, or the feature might be part of a larger function that isn't explicitly named for these tasks.\n\nTo progress further, we need to adjust our strategy to find the relevant parts of the codebase that could be related to the link checking functionality and the handling of redirects. Here are a few steps to take next:\n\n1. **Broaden the search for link checking functionality**: Since a class directly called `LinkChecker` doesn't exist, the link checking functionality might be a part of a larger utility class or function that deals with link validation or HTTP requests in general.\n\n    - `search_class(\"HttpClient\")`\n    - `search_class(\"UrlValidator\")`\n    - `search_method(\"validateLink\")`\n    - `search_method(\"checkLink\")`\n\n2. **Look for existing configuration or settings classes**: There might be a class responsible for configurations that could be leveraged to add a feature for specifying allowed redirects. This could help identify where new settings for handling redirects could be integrated.\n\n    - `search_class(\"Config\")`\n    - `search_class(\"Settings\")`\n\n3. **Search for generic HTTP request handling**: Since the project doesn't seem to have explicitly named functions for redirect parsing or processing, understanding how HTTP requests and their responses are handled in general might provide a clue.\n\n    - `search_method(\"sendRequest\")`\n    - `search_method(\"handleRequest\")`\n    - `search_code(\"HTTP redirect\")`  // This might catch more generic handling of HTTP redirects that isn't explicitly named.\n\n4. **Investigate how links are currently processed**: If link processing is part of a larger system or workflow, identifying the entry and exit points of link validation might highlight where the new logic could be inserted.\n\n    - `search_method(\"processLink\")`\n    - `search_method(\"parseUrl\")`\n\nThe goal of these adjusted searches is to cast a wider net, likely capturing the broader system within which link checking and redirect handling occur. By identifying the parts of the code responsible for similar or related tasks, it becomes possible to conceptualize where and how to implement the desired feature of prohibiting unknown redirects by listing allowed redirects as pairs of URLs."

Given the absence of other directly relevant findings through the initial searches, these `Config` classes are the only leads we have for potentially implementing or adjusting functionality related to handling redirects in the link checker feature requested in the issue.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `Config` class found in `sphinx/config.py` seems to be a general configuration handler used by Sphinx. It has methods for initializing configurations, reading values, setting and deleting items, and filtering configurations based on certain criteria. This class likely plays a central role in setting up and managing project-wide settings.\n  \n- The `Config` class found in `sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py` appears to be specific to the Napoleon extension, which is used for processing NumPy and Google-style docstrings. It has a set of predefined configuration values that are specific to how docstrings are interpreted and rendered by Sphinx.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- Since the reported issue is about enhancing a link checker to allow specifying which redirects are permitted, it's plausible that modifications or extensions to the Sphinx configuration (as handled by `Config` classes) could be required. The `Config` class in `sphinx/config.py` might be where we can introduce new configuration options to define allowed redirects. These options would then be utilized by the section of the Sphinx code responsible for checking links (which we have yet to locate) to enforce the new redirect behavior.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- For the `Config` class in `sphinx/config.py`, the intended behavior could involve adding support for a new configuration option, possibly named something like `allowed_redirects`, which would allow users to specify pairs of URLs (source and target) that are allowed to redirect. This option would involve extending the `__init__` method or creating a new method to handle this specific configuration, as well as adjusting how configuration values are read and applied by the Sphinx build process.\n  \nBased on the available context and the lack of specific functionality to directly address the issue, the next steps involve designing and implementing an extension to the Sphinx configuration system (within the `sphinx/config.py` `Config` class) to support the new feature. This would also necessitate locating or creating the components responsible for the actual link checking where these configurations would be applied, which might involve further investigation outside the immediate scope of these API search results."

However, without direct evidence of where the link checking is performed, we are at a speculative stage. Therefore:\n\n1. **do we need more context**: To better address the issue, it would be beneficial to understand how Sphinx currently processes links and how it handles external URLs during the build process. Since direct searches for methods or classes related to link checking and redirects did not yield results, let's consider some broader search strategies:\n   - `search_code(\"external link\")` or `search_code(\"URL validation\")`: These searches might help identify how Sphinx handles external links currently, possibly revealing classes or methods that deal with link checking implicitly.\n   - `search_code(\"redirect\")`: This might uncover utility functions or configurations that deal with HTTP requests or responses, including redirects, even if they were not labeled explicitly in the earlier searches.\n\n2. **where are bug locations**: Given the lack of specific locations related to direct handling of link checking and redirects, we don't have exact files, classes, or methods to point to as *bug locations* for the issue described. However, we can hypothesize about an intended behavior within the code:\n\n   - **File**: `sphinx/config.py`\n   - **Class**: `Config`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Enhance this class by introducing a new configuration option, possibly named `allowed_redirects`, which would be a list or dictionary that maps source URLs to their allowed redirected URLs. This new configuration setting would require:\n     - Modifying the `__init__` method or adding a new method to load this configuration from the Sphinx project settings (e.g., in a `conf.py` file).\n     - Integrating checks against this configuration in the link checking process, once the actual location where links are processed and validated is identified. This might mean either adding a new method to the `Config` class or elsewhere in the project to validate redirects against the `allowed_redirects` setting.\n     \n   Without identifying the precise part of the Sphinx project that deals with checking the validity of external links and handling redirects, we're unable to specify a direct bug location for the implementation of the new feature. The search for how Sphinx processes links needs to be expanded, possibly requiring a review of the Sphinx documentation or source code outside of the API search capabilities provided here."
