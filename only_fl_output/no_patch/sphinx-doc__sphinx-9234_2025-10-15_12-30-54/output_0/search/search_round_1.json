Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the initial set of API calls, it's evident that the specific class names, method names, and code snippets related to link checking and handling or configuring redirects do not exist under the anticipated names in the codebase. This suggests that the functionality related to link checking and redirect handling might be integrated into different parts of the project under different names, or the feature might be part of a larger function that isn't explicitly named for these tasks.\n\nTo progress further, we need to adjust our strategy to find the relevant parts of the codebase that could be related to the link checking functionality and the handling of redirects. Here are a few steps to take next:\n\n1. **Broaden the search for link checking functionality**: Since a class directly called `LinkChecker` doesn't exist, the link checking functionality might be a part of a larger utility class or function that deals with link validation or HTTP requests in general.\n\n    - `search_class(\"HttpClient\")`\n    - `search_class(\"UrlValidator\")`\n    - `search_method(\"validateLink\")`\n    - `search_method(\"checkLink\")`\n\n2. **Look for existing configuration or settings classes**: There might be a class responsible for configurations that could be leveraged to add a feature for specifying allowed redirects. This could help identify where new settings for handling redirects could be integrated.\n\n    - `search_class(\"Config\")`\n    - `search_class(\"Settings\")`\n\n3. **Search for generic HTTP request handling**: Since the project doesn't seem to have explicitly named functions for redirect parsing or processing, understanding how HTTP requests and their responses are handled in general might provide a clue.\n\n    - `search_method(\"sendRequest\")`\n    - `search_method(\"handleRequest\")`\n    - `search_code(\"HTTP redirect\")`  // This might catch more generic handling of HTTP redirects that isn't explicitly named.\n\n4. **Investigate how links are currently processed**: If link processing is part of a larger system or workflow, identifying the entry and exit points of link validation might highlight where the new logic could be inserted.\n\n    - `search_method(\"processLink\")`\n    - `search_method(\"parseUrl\")`\n\nThe goal of these adjusted searches is to cast a wider net, likely capturing the broader system within which link checking and redirect handling occur. By identifying the parts of the code responsible for similar or related tasks, it becomes possible to conceptualize where and how to implement the desired feature of prohibiting unknown redirects by listing allowed redirects as pairs of URLs."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
