        "content": "Based on the description of the issue, the problem lies in how the relative path is displayed in the skip report when the tested file is in a directory above the directory from where `pytest` is called. The issue mentions a discrepancy in the expected output in the console log during the testing process. To address this issue, we need to look into how `pytest` generates and formats these messages, specifically focusing on skipped tests and the calculation of file paths relative to the invocation directory. Here are the API calls that we could use to gather information:\n\n1. **Search for how pytest handles skipped tests**: We need to identify the method or function responsible for generating skip reports. Likely, this would involve something related to the test collection or outcome reporting functionalities of pytest. Therefore, a good starting point would be looking for a method that deals with skipping tests.\n   - `search_method(\"report_skipped_tests\")`\n   \n2. **Search for how pytest calculates paths**: Since the issue involves the relative path calculation, we should look for methods that are responsible for determining the paths of tested files relative to the current or invocation directory.\n   - `search_method(\"calculate_relative_path\")`\n\n3. **Inspect the skip report generation code**: The issue specifically mentions that the path is displayed incorrectly in the skip report. We need to inspect the part of the code where skip reports are formatted for output.\n   - `search_code(\"SKIPPED [\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering context around how `pytest` processes skipped tests and calculates their paths for reporting purposes. The results from these searches will help in pinpointing the area in the codebase that needs to be patched."
