Given your requirements, here's a `reproducer.py` script designed for the described behavior. This script programmatically creates the necessary directory structure and a sample test file to reproduce the issue. It utilizes subprocess to run pytest against the test file and checks the output against the expected result. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., the skip report path is incorrect) and exits normally (exit code 0) if the issue is fixed (i.e., the skip report shows the correct relative path).

```python
import os
import subprocess
import shutil

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_test_environment():
    # Create test directories and file
    os.makedirs("my_tests", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("pytest", exist_ok=True)

    test_file_path = "my_tests/test1.py"
    with open(test_file_path, "w") as test_file:
        test_file.writelines([
            "import pytest\n",
            "@pytest.mark.skip(reason='no way of currently testing this')\n",
            "def test_example():\n",
            "    assert True\n"
        ])

def run_pytest_and_check_output():
    # Change working directory to pytest
    os.chdir("pytest")

    # Run pytest command
    result = subprocess.run(["pytest", "-rs", "../my_tests/test1.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)

    # Return to the root directory
    os.chdir("../")

    return result

def main():
    try:
        # Setup test environment
        setup_test_environment()

        # Invoke pytest and capture its output
        result = run_pytest_and_check_output()

        # Check if the output has the correct relative path in the skip report
        expected_output_fragment = "../my_tests/test1.py:3: no way of currently testing this"
        assert expected_output_fragment in result.stdout, "Skip report does not show the correct relative path."

        print("Issue not found: Skip report shows the correct relative path.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    finally:
        # Cleanup: Consider commenting out this during debugging, so you can inspect the files
        shutil.rmtree("my_tests")
        shutil.rmtree("pytest")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note:
- This script assumes you have `pytest` installed in your environment. If not, please install it using `pip install pytest` before running the script.
- The script modifies the current working directory during its execution and later attempts to revert it. Ensure it's executed in a safe, preferably isolated environment to avoid unintended side effects.
- The cleanup process at the end of the script (`shutil.rmtree` calls) will remove the created directories and files after the test run. If you wish to inspect these, you might want to comment out those lines temporarily.
