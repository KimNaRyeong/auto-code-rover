It still might not directly reproduce the aspect of coarseness in a quantitative manner that leads to an `AssertionError` under the conditions described due to the graphical nature of the issue.\n\nHowever, it aims to provide a framework for comparing the outcomes before and after applying an operation presumed to be no-op (`* 1` on vertices), accommodating the feedback from the first attempt. The script may require further adjustments concerning what exactly constitutes a \"coarseness\" change in this graphical context."
