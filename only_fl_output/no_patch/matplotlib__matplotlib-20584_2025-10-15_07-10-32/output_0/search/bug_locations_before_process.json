        "intended_behavior": "The set_segments method should be capable of taking the segments returned by get_segments and applying them to the LineCollection without altering their visual appearance or the density/resolution of the lines. The issue indicates that merely reapplying the segments results in a coarser representation, which suggests that either the method mistakenly reduces the segment resolution or does not handle the segment data correctly when re-setting it. The fix should ensure that segment fidelity is preserved between getting and setting without any unintended transformation or simplification. This preservation should keep the detail level identical pre and post the operation, ensuring that a no-op (like set_segments(get_segments())) indeed results in no visual change."
