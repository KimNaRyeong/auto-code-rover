        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, a `__len__` method should be implemented in the `Pipeline` class. This method should return the number of steps in the pipeline, allowing the pipeline object to support the `len()` function without causing errors. This addition aims to enhance the `Pipeline` class's usability by enabling users to query its length, which is particularly useful in scenarios where understanding the size of the pipeline, or using it in operations that require knowledge of its length, is crucial. The new method should not interfere with or alter the existing functionalities of the `Pipeline` class. Instead, it should act as an additional feature that compliments the current methods, especially `__getitem__`, which already allows indexing and slicing operations."
