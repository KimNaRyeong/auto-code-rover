I understand you're asking for a revised script targeting the exact issue described. Let's create a `reproducer.py` that attempts to utilize `len(pipe)` on a `Pipeline` object from `scikit-learn`, capturing both the intended behavior and handling any exceptions properly to surface the specific issue:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.datasets import samples_generator
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    
    # Generate some data to play with
    X, y = samples_generator.make_classification(n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)
    
    anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
    pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])
    
    try:
        # Attempt to use len() on pipe, which should reflect the number of steps in the pipeline
        pipeline_length = len(pipe)
        print(f"Pipeline length: {pipeline_length}")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    try:
        assert len(pipe) == len(pipe.steps), "Pipeline length does not match number of steps"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Ensure the script exits with error for an unmet assertion

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script specifically expects `len(pipe)` to succeed and match the number of steps in the `Pipeline` (captured by `len(pipe.steps)`). If any part of the behavior is not as expected (e.g., an exception is raised or the lengths don't match), the issue will be captured and reported through a detailed stack trace. The correct behavior (i.e., when `len(pipe)` accurately reflects the number of pipeline steps, and no exceptions are raised) will result in the script exiting with code 0, otherwise, it exits with code 1 indicating the presence of the issue.
