</code><intended_behavior>Modifications may be needed to ensure that when natural keys are used, particularly in conjunction with `use_natural_foreign_keys`, the process accurately resolves related objects across different databases. This might involve ensuring database context (i.e., the `using` parameter) is consistently passed and respected throughout the entire object graph being deserialized.</intended_behavior>]
