To approach this task, we'll implement a standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, designed to be run in the context of a Django project. This script will directly address the reported issue by setting up a minimum Django environment programmatically, defining the necessary models with natural keys, and attempting a data import on a non-default database. If the specified issue arises, the script will catch and display the exception and its traceback using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. Moreover, it ensures that necessary cleanup and setup are performed to accurately reflect a typical use case scenario.

Please note that for this script to function as intended, your Django project must be correctly configured, especially regarding database settings for the 'other' database. Also, ensure the presence of a JSON fixture file named `books.json` in the project's root directory containing the relevant serialized data.

```python
import os
import django
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import models

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)

    def natural_key(self):
        return (self.name,)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_label'

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='books')

    def natural_key(self):
        return (self.title,) + self.author.natural_key()
    natural_key.dependencies = ['your_app_label.author']

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_label'
        unique_together = [('title', 'author')]

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to load the fixture data into 'other' database
        call_command('loaddata', 'books.json', database='other')
        print("Data loaded successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected: loaddata failed on non-default database.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the path to your Django project settings module and `'your_app_label'` with the actual app label where your models are defined.

This script assumes you have a Django project set up and configured to handle multiple databases, specifically having one referred to as 'other'. It attempts to load the fixture data using the `loaddata` command into the 'other' database. If the operation fails due to the issue under discussion, it will provide a detailed traceback for further investigation.

Before running this script, ensure that:
- Your Django environment is correctly set up and configured.
- The necessary database configurations are in place, especially for the non-default database ('other').
- A fixture file named `books.json` containing the serialized data exists in the project root.

Running this script as part of your Django project will help identify if the reported issue is present and provide insight into the failure through a printed stack trace.
