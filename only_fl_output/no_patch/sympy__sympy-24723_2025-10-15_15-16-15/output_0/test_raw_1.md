Certainly! Here is a corrected version of `reproducer.py` to specifically reproduce the originally reported issue concerning the probability density function of a Matrix Normal Distribution in Sympy:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_matrix_normal_pdf():
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, exp, pi, Matrix
    from sympy.stats import density, MatrixNormal
    import sympy as sp

    # Matrix Normal Distribution Parameters
    M = MatrixNormal('M', Matrix([[1, 2]]), Matrix([[1]]), Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))
    X = MatrixSymbol('X', 1, 2)

    # Getting the actual density
    actual_density = density(M)(X).doit()

    # Extract the coefficient of the exponent (to compare the normalization constant)
    # Since the normalizing constant is the part of the expression outside of exp(),
    # we simplify the expression under the assumption that the integration over all space = 1.
    try:
        # Attempt to get the coefficient directly assuming standard form
        constant_term = actual_density.as_coefficients_dict()[exp(1)]
    except:
        raise AssertionError("Failed to retrieve the constant term from the actual density.")

    # The expected normalization factor based on the given issue description is 1/(2*pi)
    expected_constant = 1/(2*pi)

    # Assert the normalization factor
    if sp.simplify(constant_term - expected_constant) != 0:
        raise AssertionError("Normalization factor in the PDF is incorrect.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_matrix_normal_pdf()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    else:
        print("The issue is either fixed, or the test did not reproduce the issue.")
        SystemExit(0)
```

This script aims to check the normalization factor directly from the PDF generated by Sympy, comparing it with the expected value based on the provided information in the original issue. If the normalization factor derived from the Sympy output does not match the expected value, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. If the test passes, it indicates either the issue has been fixed or this specific test did not capture the problem accurately.
