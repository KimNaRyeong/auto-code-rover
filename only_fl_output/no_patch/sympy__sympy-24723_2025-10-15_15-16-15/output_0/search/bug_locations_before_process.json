        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the code at this location is to accurately compute the probability density function (PDF) for the `MatrixNormal` distribution according to its mathematical definition. Specifically, the issue points out an incorrect constant in the denominator of the PDF expression. The correct formula, as per the issue description and mathematical standards, should incorporate a constant that correctly reflects the dimensions of matrices involved and matches the formula specified on the referenced Wikipedia page. The correction should ensure that the constant in the denominator aligns with the \\(2\\pi\\) (for each variable in the matrix) component of the formula, which may require adjusting how the determinant and trace operations contribute to the formula, especially in their relationship to the exponential component. This adjustment will not only rectify the reported issue but also preserve the existing functionality by ensuring that the PDF computation remains accurate for any given parameters of a `MatrixNormal` distribution. The exact correction would involve revising the computation of the normalization constant in the PDF expression to ensure it accurately represents the mathematical formula for any dimensionality of the input matrices."
