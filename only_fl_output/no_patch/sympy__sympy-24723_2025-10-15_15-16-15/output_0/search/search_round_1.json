This directly addresses where in the codebase the issue likely resides.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n#### Result related to `MatrixGamma`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  This snippet defines the density computation for the `MatrixGamma` distribution, showcasing an example of how a density function is implemented and utilized within the Sympy stats module for matrix distributions.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  Although this result does not directly relate to the `MatrixNormal` class, it provides insight into the standard structure and syntax used in Sympy for defining density functions of matrix distributions. This could be useful for understanding the correct approach and potential problems in the `MatrixNormal` density implementation.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior here is to correctly compute the density for the `MatrixGamma` distribution, which might parallel the correct approach needed for the `MatrixNormal` density computation.\n\n#### Result directly related to `MatrixNormal`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  This snippet directly shows the part of the code where the density for a `MatrixNormal` distribution is computed and showcased with a simple example. It calculates the probability density function (PDF) for the given `MatrixNormal` distribution.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  This piece of code is directly related to the bug as it contains the computation of the PDF for the `MatrixNormal` distribution, which, according to the issue, incorrectly computes the constant in the PDF expression.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior would be to correctly compute the PDF of a `MatrixNormal` distribution, matching the mathematical definition provided in the issue description. According to the correct formula, the PDF should include the constant \\(2\\pi\\) in the denominator (considering the single-dimensional case here for simplicity).\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nGiven these insights, the correct constant is not applied in the denominator of the PDF computation for `MatrixNormal`. The current implementation seems to use a different constant, which mathematically misrepresents the formula.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nTo formulate a patch, a deeper examination of how the constant is calculated and applied in the `MatrixNormal` density method is required. Given that the class and method exist in `sympy/stats/matrix_distributions.py`, it would be strategic to:\n\n1. **Inspect the `density` method of `MatrixNormal` in depth:**  \n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/stats/matrix_distributions.py\", 484, 10)`\n\n2. **Review the PDF formula implementation for potential mathematical discrepancies:**  \n   This includes checking for the calculation and application of constants in the formula.\n\n3. **Understand any auxiliary methods or properties that might influence the PDF calculation,** such as methods or properties that help compute the determinant, trace, or exponential functions used in the formula.\n\nThese steps should steer towards identifying the specific cause of the discrepancy and formulating an accurate patch."

Specifically, the issue points out an incorrect constant in the denominator of the PDF expression. The correct formula, as per the issue description and mathematical standards, should incorporate a constant that correctly reflects the dimensions of matrices involved and matches the formula specified on the referenced Wikipedia page.\n   - The correction should ensure that the constant in the denominator aligns with the \\(2\\pi\\) (for each variable in the matrix) component of the formula, which may require adjusting how the determinant and trace operations contribute to the formula, especially in their relationship to the exponential component.\n   - This adjustment will not only rectify the reported issue but also preserve the existing functionality by ensuring that the PDF computation remains accurate for any given parameters of a `MatrixNormal` distribution. The exact correction would involve revising the computation of the normalization constant in the PDF expression to ensure it accurately represents the mathematical formula for any dimensionality of the input matrices."
