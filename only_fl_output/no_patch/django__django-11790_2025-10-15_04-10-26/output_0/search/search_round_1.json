Based on the issue description, this problem may involve looking into the form's definition and perhaps where the username field specifically is handled or modified, especially in relation to the mentioned regression.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to collect the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `AuthenticationForm` class to find which file it's defined in:\n   - `search_class(\"AuthenticationForm\")`\n\n2. Since the regression was introduced in a specific commit (5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13), it's important to check any code changes related to `AuthenticationForm` or its `username` field around this commit. However, understanding we cannot search directly by commit in these API calls, we should at least find where the username field is defined or manipulated within `AuthenticationForm`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"AuthenticationForm\", \"__init__\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean_username\", \"AuthenticationForm\")`\n\n3. Lastly, it might be beneficial to look for any explicit mention of the `maxlength` attribute being set or modified for the `username` field in the entire codebase, to understand how it was previously handled and where the regression might have occurred:\n   - `search_code(\"maxlength\")`\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of where the issue might lie within the codebase, focusing on the authentication form's structure and any recent changes that could have affected the `maxlength` attribute handling for the username field."

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze each part:\n\n### 1. AuthenticationForm in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `AuthenticationForm` class in Django is primarily responsible for handling user authentication. It declares a `username` field using `UsernameField` with a specific widget (`forms.TextInput`) and attributes (`attrs={'autofocus': True}`). The class also defines a `password` field, error messages, and several methods including a custom `__init__` method. This custom `__init__` method sets up the form upon initialization, notably adjusting the `maxlength` for the `username` field based on the `UserModel`'s `USERNAME_FIELD` property.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nThe reported issue is that the `AuthenticationForm`'s `username` field doesn't render with the `maxlength` HTML attribute. The `__init__` method directly manipulates the `maxlength` attribute of the `username` field, making it a crucial part of understanding why this bug has occurred. The setup in this method is intended to ensure the `maxlength` of the `username` field reflects the underlying model's constraints.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior within the `__init__` method was to set the `maxlength` attribute of the `username` field so that it matches the max length defined by the `UserModel`'s username field (`self.fields['username'].max_length = self.username_field.max_length or 254`). This is expected to enforce a maximum input length in the HTML rendering of the form, preventing users from entering data longer than the database supports.\n\n### 2. Method `clean_username` Not Found in AuthenticationForm\n\n#### Implication\n\nThe absence of a `clean_username` method within `AuthenticationForm` suggests either misunderstanding in the bug report or changes in the implementation that moved validation logic elsewhere. Given the issue focuses on the rendering aspect (specifically, the `maxlength` HTML attribute), the primary concern might not directly relate to a method for cleaning the username but rather to how fields are prepared for rendering.\n\n### 3. Search for Code Containing `maxlength`\n\n#### Relationship with the issue\n\nThis was a broad search intended to find references to `maxlength` across the project, which could potentially illuminate how and where `maxlength` attributes are generally handled within forms or fields. However, without specific findings related to `AuthenticationForm`, this search is more about understanding the broader context of `maxlength` handling in Django. The lack of specificity to `AuthenticationForm` means we might need more targeted searches or a deeper dive into how form rendering translates field properties like `maxlength` into HTML attributes.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe analysis indicates the issue lies within how `AuthenticationForm`'s `__init__` method is not effectively rendering the `maxlength` HTML attribute, despite explicitly setting this attribute based on the `UserModel` definition. Since Django typically translates field properties into HTML attributes during form rendering, a potential disconnect or regression might be preventing this for the `maxlength` attribute specifically.\n\nTo better understand why this disconnect occurs\u2014whether due to a regression introduced by changes in Django's form rendering logic or changes in how `AuthenticationForm`'s fields are initialized or rendered\u2014we might need to:\n- Investigate how Django's form rendering logic has changed around the implicated commits.\n- Look into how form field attributes are translated into HTML attributes across different versions of Django (this may require a deeper dive into Django's form rendering system, potentially looking at the form's `BaseForm` class from which `Form` inherits, or the widget rendering logic in `django/forms/widgets.py` where `TextInput` and other widgets are defined).\n\nGiven the specifics of the regression and the clear involvement of `AuthenticationForm`'s custom `__init__` method, the investigation should focus on the translation of field attributes to HTML attributes during form rendering to identify why `maxlength` is omitted."

Bug locations:\n   - File: django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n   - Class: AuthenticationForm\n   - Method: __init__\n   - Intended behavior: The `__init__` method of the `AuthenticationForm` is correctly setting the `maxlength` attribute of the `username` field based on the `UserModel`'s `USERNAME_FIELD` property. The intended correction here would ensure that this `maxlength` attribute is not only set but also effectively rendered into the HTML as an attribute of the input element for the username field. This may require validating or ensuring that the form field's attributes, specifically `maxlength`, are correctly passed down to the widget level where HTML rendering occurs. The existing functionality, including setting the `maxlength` and label based on the `UserModel`, needs to be preserved while ensuring that the `maxlength` attribute is rendered in the HTML output. This ensures that client-side validation for the input maximum length aligns with the backend's expectations, preserving usability and data integrity."
