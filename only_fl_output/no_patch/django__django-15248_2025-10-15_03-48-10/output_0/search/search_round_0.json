If it's deleted from a model.delete(), you know which instance initiated the delete and if it's from a queryset.delete() you know which queryset initiated the delete, with the models in that queryset. Using this you know if the instance is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n</issue>"

This could include searching for any custom signals or the usage of Django's built-in signals for deletion. \n    - `search_code(\"pre_delete\")`\n    - `search_code(\"post_delete\")`\n\n2. **Identify how deletions are handled**: Since the issue description mentions the interest in distinguishing between deletion initiated by `model.delete()` and `queryset.delete()`, it's important to look at how these methods are implemented.\n    - `search_method(\"delete\")`\n\n3. **Examine signal receivers or handlers**: Knowing where and how these signals are received or handled can provide insights into the current implementation and what needs to be modified or extended.\n    - `search_code(\"receiver\")`\n    - `search_code(\"post_delete.connect\")`\n    - `search_code(\"pre_delete.connect\")`\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, focusing on these elements should provide enough context to move forward with a solution that addresses the need to differentiate the source of deletion operations within signal handlers."
