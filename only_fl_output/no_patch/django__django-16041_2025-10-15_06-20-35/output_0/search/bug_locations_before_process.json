        "intended_behavior": "The method `empty_form` should seamlessly handle any `form_kwargs` passed during formset initialization, specifically ignoring or correctly processing the `empty_permitted` parameter for the `empty_form`. This means ensuring that the `empty_form` remains functional even when `empty_permitted` is explicitly set in `form_kwargs`. This could potentially involve filtering out `empty_permitted` from the `form_kwargs` before they are applied to `empty_form` if it's determined that explicitly setting `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs` leads to conflicts or errors. The preservation of existing functionality implies that any modifications should not interfere with how `form_kwargs` are applied to other forms within the formset\u2014only to `empty_form`, in a way that respects its unique role and requirements (namely, that it should always have `empty_permitted=True`). The solution should focus on ensuring the `empty_form` property in `BaseFormSet` handles `form_kwargs` in a way that avoids the KeyError and maintains the expected behavior of `empty_permitted` for all forms within the formset, including the `empty_form`. This might involve enhancing how `get_form_kwargs(None)` is executed or introducing additional logic to selectively apply or ignore `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`."
