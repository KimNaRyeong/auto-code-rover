SQLite3 migrations can fail when used quoted db_table.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Maciej Olko)
	 
If model's Meta db_table is quoted, e.g. '"table_with_quoted_name"', SQLite3 migration with this table creation with can fail with django.db.utils.OperationalError: near "table_with_quoted_name": syntax error.
I suppose following generated query causes the error:
CREATE TABLE "new__"table_with_quoted_name"" ("obj_id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, "obj_num" varchar(20) NULL, "country_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "countries" ("country_id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED)
To reproduce table with quoted name should have at least one foreign key.
Django documentation says it supports quoted names (​https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/databases/#naming-issues).
Quoted names can also be used with Django’s other supported database backends; except for Oracle, however, the quotes have no effect.
