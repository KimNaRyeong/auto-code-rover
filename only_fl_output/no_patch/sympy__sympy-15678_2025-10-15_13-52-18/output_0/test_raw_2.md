To accurately capture and reproduce the reported issues with `idiff` not supporting equations (`Eq`) and functions (`f(x)`), and to adhere to the provided requirements for a `reproducer.py` script, follow this template. This script will assert the presence of the reported issues through raised `AssertionError`s when the issues are encountered and will print the appropriate stack trace using the provided function. If the issue has been resolved, the script should exit with code 0 and without uncaught exceptions.

```python
from sympy import Eq, exp, symbols, Function
from sympy.calculus.util import idiff

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    f = Function('f')(x)

    # Testing idiff with Eq object
    try:
        eq_result = idiff(Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x)), y, x)
        assert eq_result, "idiff failed to process Eq object"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("idiff does not support Eq objects properly.")

    # Testing idiff with f(x) instead of y
    try:
        fx_result = idiff(f*exp(f) - x*exp(x), f, x)
        assert fx_result, "idiff failed to process f(x) instead of y"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("idiff does not support f(x) instead of y.")

    # Sanity test
    try:
        sanity_result = idiff(y*exp(y)- x*exp(x), y, x)
        assert sanity_result == "(x + 1)*exp(x - y)/(y + 1)", "Sanity check failed."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Sanity check failed for idiff.")

    print("Tests completed. If no assertion was raised, the issues are not present in the current setup.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script checks for the specific issues mentioned:

- `idiff` handling of the `Eq` object.
- `idiff` processing an expression involving `f(x)` instead of a simple symbol like `y`.
- Plus a sanity check to ensure `idiff` works as expected under normal circumstances.

If any of these tests fail, the script raises an `AssertionError` indicating the problem and prints a stack trace of where the exception occurred. If the script runs without raising an `AssertionError`, it means no issues were encountered based on the given tests, assuming that the used version of SymPy can potentially either not have these issues or the environment behaves differently due to other factors.
