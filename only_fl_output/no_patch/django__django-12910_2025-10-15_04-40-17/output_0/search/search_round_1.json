        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `Command` Class Occurrences\n\nThe search for the `Command` class revealed it appears across various files within the Django framework, most notably within `django/core/management/commands/` and `django/contrib/*` directories. These commands are utility classes used by Django's command-line utility to execute a wide range of actions, from database migrations to running servers.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The `Command` class should support a way to specify which system checks to run before executing the command logic. The current behavior uses a boolean flag `requires_system_checks` to decide whether to run all checks or skip them entirely. The desired behavior is more granular control over which checks to run, enabling commands to specify either all, none, or a specific subset of checks.\n\n#### 2. `requires_system_checks = True` in `base.py`\n\nThis code snippet shows the declaration of the `requires_system_checks` attribute within what seems to be a base command class (`BaseCommand`) in `django/core/management/base.py`. This attribute is set to `True` by default, indicating that, by default, all system checks are to be run before the command executes unless explicitly overridden.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**: This is the direct target for modification to implement the proposed change. Instead of a boolean indicating whether all checks should be executed, a list (or a special value like `'__all__'`) should specify exactly which checks to execute.\n\n**Intended Behavior Post-Modification**: Replace the boolean attribute with `required_system_checks` which could be set to `'__all__'`, an empty list `[]`, or a list of specific check tags e.g., `['staticfiles']`.\n\n#### 3. Usage of `options['skip_checks']`\n\nThe snippets where `options['skip_checks']` was being evaluated highlight how different commands handle the decision to skip checks. This manual handling is mentioned as error-prone in the issue description.\n\n- `collectstatic.py` and `migrate.py` directly read `skip_checks` from `options` to decide whether to perform checks.\n- `base.py` also uses it in a base execution method indicating a framework-level convention for skipping checks.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**: These snippets illustrate the current workaround approach to selectively skipping checks by modifying command options.\n\n**Intended Behavior Post-Modification**: With the proposed `required_system_checks` attribute, each command should be able to specify its required checks more declaratively. The manual, error-prone checking of `options['skip_checks']` should be replaced or supplemented by this more structured and clear attribute, reducing the burden on command implementations to handle checks correctly.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the analyzed context:\n\n1. **Propose a change to `BaseCommand`** in `django/core/management/base.py` to replace `requires_system_checks = True` with a more flexible attribute. This will likely involve modifying the class definition to include the new `required_system_checks` attribute and updating any logic that currently relies on `requires_system_checks`.\n\n2. **Refactor existing Command implementations** to adopt the new system. This involves changing command classes in various `django/contrib/*` and `django/core/management/commands/` files to utilize `required_system_checks` for more granular control over their system checks.\n\n3. **Update the framework's system check mechanism** to interpret the new `required_system_checks` attribute properly. This might involve modifying the code that currently checks the value of `options['skip_checks']` and `requires_system_checks` to accommodate the new approach.\n\nThis refactoring aims to make the Django command utility more flexible and robust, reducing the potential for errors and making it easier for developers to specify exactly the system checks required for their commands to run safely and effectively."

This new attribute should accept three types of values: `'__all__'` indicating all checks should be performed, `[]` (an empty list) indicating no checks should be performed, and a list of specific check tags (e.g., `['staticfiles']`) indicating only checks with those tags should be performed. Modify any logic that interprets `requires_system_checks` to instead work with `required_system_checks`, ensuring backward compatibility wherever feasible.\n  \n- **Additional Considerations:**\n  - Evaluate and refactor the logic within the `execute` method in the same `base.py` file, or similar central methods that implement or call the check routines based on `requires_system_checks` or `options['skip_checks']`, to support the enhanced behavior of `required_system_checks`. This should include parsing the new attribute correctly and executing system checks based on its value, eliminating or centralizing the manual checks for `options['skip_checks']`.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2 (General):**\n  - **Files:** Various files containing Command subclasses (e.g., `collectstatic.py`, `migrate.py`, and others listed in the search results). Specifically, these are files under `django/core/management/commands/` and `django/contrib/*/management/commands/`.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Refactor Command subclasses to utilize the new `required_system_checks` instead of the `requires_system_checks` attribute for specifying system check requirements. Each subclass should determine its appropriate checks or explicitly opt-out by setting this to an empty list `[]` or use `'__all__'` for full checks. This update aims to clear the usage of `options['skip_checks']` in favor of a more declarative approach provided by `required_system_checks`.\n\nThese intended changes correspond with the issue's request for a more flexible, clear, and less error-prone way of specifying system checks requirement for Django command classes, streamlining their execution and ensuring a safer and more customizable command environment."
