This new attribute should accept three types of values: '__all__' indicating all checks should be performed, [] (an empty list) indicating no checks should be performed, and a list of specific check tags (e.g., ['staticfiles']) indicating only checks with those tags should be performed. Modify any logic that interprets requires_system_checks to instead work with required_system_checks, ensuring backward compatibility wherever feasible. Evaluate and refactor the logic within the execute method in the same base.py file, or similar central methods that implement or call the check routines based on requires_system_checks or options['skip_checks'], to support the enhanced behavior of required_system_checks. This should include parsing the new attribute correctly and executing system checks based on its value, eliminating or centralizing the manual checks for options['skip_checks']."
