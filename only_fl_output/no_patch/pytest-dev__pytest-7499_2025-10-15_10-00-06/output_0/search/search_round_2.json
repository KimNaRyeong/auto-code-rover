Given the context of the issue, which revolves around the behavior of `pytest.raises` especially in relation to matching error messages, our primary focus should be the `src/_pytest/python_api.py` file. This is because `test_excinfo.py` is likely related to unit tests for pytest functionality, while `python_api.py` likely contains the actual implementation of the `pytest.raises` method, among other utility methods for Python-based testing.\n\n### Analysis Goals\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `pytest.raises` method is designed to provide a context manager that checks for a specific exception to be raised within a block of code. It optionally allows for matching a specific error message or pattern. Understanding its implementation detail will reveal how it compares the exception message with the `match` parameter value, handling special cases such as regular expressions or plain string comparisons.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The issue reports confusion when the expected pattern (a plain string in this particular case) exactly matches the exception message, but pytest still fails the test indicating a mismatch. This suggests a potential issue or oversight in how the `match` parameter's handling is implemented in `raises`. Specifically, how it interprets plain strings, possibly mishandling cases involving special characters like parentheses.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   Ideally, the `raises` method should accurately compare the error message against the match pattern, recognizing cases when an exact string is provided (not a regex pattern) and handling special characters appropriately. Additionally, if a potential common mistake is identified (such as not realizing a plain string is being treated as a regex), it could benefit from improved error messaging or warnings to guide the user towards the correct usage.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven these analysis goals, we need to inspect the implementation of `pytest.raises` in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` more closely. This involves looking at how it handles the `match` parameter and how it compares this parameter with the actual exception message. Insights into these mechanics will help identify the cause of the reported issue and suggest possible resolutions.\n\nTo move forward, an appropriate next step would be to fetch the implementation details of `raises` within `src/_pytest/python_api.py`. This can be achieved by retrieving code snippets from the file where `raises` is implemented:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"raises\", \"src/_pytest/python_api.py\")`\n\nThis will provide specific insights into its logic, particularly how match patterns are processed and compared against caught exceptions' messages."

Furthermore, when a `match` parameter is provided, the method should accurately match the exception message against the specified pattern. The issue arises in the interpretation or comparison process of the `match` parameter against the raised exception's message, especially when the match string contains characters that have special meanings in regular expressions (like parentheses).\n\n   To resolve the issue, the intended behavior of the `raises` method should be extended or refined to:\n   - Explicitly check if the `match` parameter is intended as a plain string or a regular expression. This could be inferred from the presence of regex special characters or potentially through an additional parameter specifying the match type.\n   - Enhance error messages or warnings when a potential misunderstanding in string vs regex usage could lead to confusing outcomes, as noted in the bug report. Specifically, it should guide the user towards escaping special characters if they intend to use a plain string that includes such characters.\n   - Preserve existing functionality for matching and asserting exception raises, ensuring that any modifications do not disrupt current user expectations for both plain string matches and regular expression matches.\n\nThis approach aims to mitigate the confusion and improve user experience without compromising the flexibility and power of `pytest.raises` for advanced matching scenarios."

There are three significant reveals from the search results, each shedding light on different aspects and overloads of the `raises` method.\n\n### Understanding the Collected Context\n\n1. **First and Second Search Results**\n   - These results show the method signature of `raises` but do not detail the implementation, indicated by `... # pragma: no cover`. It likely defines overloads or a general signature pattern for the context manager and function usage forms of `raises`.\n\n2. **Third Search Result**\n   - Provides extensive documentation and the implementation logic of `raises` within a context manager and as a callable.\n   - The method accepts an `expected_exception` parameter to specify the exception type that should be caught.\n   - The `match` parameter is described as an optional string or regular expression pattern to be tested against the string representation of the exception.\n   - The context manager form of `raises` captures the exception and provides an `ExceptionInfo` object that allows inspection of the exception details.\n   - It also touches on the usability of the `match` parameter, specifying that it's effectively employed in the context manager usage to assert text or regex matches on the exception message.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe described bug involves `pytest.raises` behavior when the `match` parameter is provided, specifically highlighting the confusing error message outcome when the exception message exactly matches the pattern, but pytest reflects a mismatch. This confusion could stem from how pytest applies the `match` parameter against the exception message, possibly interpreting strings with special regex characters differently than intended by the user.\n\n### Intended Behavior in Context of the Issue\n\nConsidering the issue description and the functionality laid out in the collected context:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - It provides a mechanism to assert that a block of code raises an expected exception and optionally matches the exception message against a provided pattern.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The handling and interpretation of the `match` parameter concerning special characters in strings (like parentheses) are central to the reported confusion, suggesting a possible enhancement in either the matching logic or user guidance on using regex patterns.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The method should improve its handling of the `match` parameter to better distinguish between intended literal strings and regex patterns, especially for strings containing special regex characters. This may involve enhancing the matching logic to automatically escape special characters when a literal match is detected or providing clearer guidance or warnings to users about the necessity of escaping special characters when they intend a literal string match.\n\n   - A significant part of resolving the issue might also involve updating the documentation or warning messages to make users aware of the potential pitfalls with regex special characters in the `match` parameter and offer guidance on how to use `re.escape` for literal strings that include these characters.\n\nThe context thus gathered nicely frames the bug within the scope of improving user experience and functionality of the `pytest.raises` method's string matching capabilities. A patch might include code changes to auto-escape special characters when a literal string is detected and/or enhance the documentation and error messages to guide users more effectively."

The enhancement should aim to:\n\n   - Detect if the `match` parameter is likely being used as a literal string (e.g., using regex special characters without any regex indicators like anchors `^`, `$`, character classes `[`, `]`, quantifiers `*`, `+`, `?`, etc.). If a string includes special characters but doesn't follow a typical regex pattern, suggest the user escape these characters or automatically do so within the pytest logic, ensuring a literal comparison is performed. One approach could be to analyze the string and if it's detected as a non-regex pattern but contains regex special characters, either:\n     1. Automatically escape these special characters, or\n     2. Raise a more informative error or warning suggesting the use of `re.escape()` on the `match` string.\n\n   - Ensure that improvements to error messaging or logic adjustments to automatically handle special characters in `match` strings do not disrupt existing functionality. This means any literal or regex match specifications currently functioning should remain unaffected by changes intended to clarify or correct mismatches related due to special character inclusion.\n\n   - Update documentation within the method and possibly the official pytest documentation to highlight this consideration, guiding users on best practices when using the `match` parameter with strings that may be interpreted as regular expressions.\n\nThis approach aims to ease the user experience by addressing the specific confusion outlined in the issue while preserving the intended flexibility and powerful features of `pytest.raises`."
