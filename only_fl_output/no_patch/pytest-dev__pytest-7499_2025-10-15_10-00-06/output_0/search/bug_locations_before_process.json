        "intended_behavior": "Within this method, particularly where the match parameter is processed, the intended behavior should carefully handle scenarios where the match parameter is a plain string that includes special characters, which might be misconstrued as part of a regular expression. Suggestions include detecting if the match parameter is used as a literal string and if so, either automatically escaping these special characters or raising a more informative error or warning, ensuring a literal comparison is performed without disrupting existing functionality."
