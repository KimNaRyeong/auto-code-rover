        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the implementation of the primary key inheritance in the project's model classes, especially focusing on the `Entity` class from which the `User` model inherits (as specifically mentioned in the issue). Given this, our API calls will target these significant areas:\n\n1. Search for the `Entity` class to understand how the primary key is being defined, as this seems to be the root class for models like `User`.\n2. Search for the `User` class to understand how it inherits from `Entity` and how the primary key is managed in this subclass.\n3. Additionally, we can search for one or more model configuration settings in the project to understand how models like `User` are configured, particularly looking out for any `AppConfig` related configurations.\n4. We could also consider reviewing how migrations are typically generated or how the default auto field settings are applied in the project config.\n\nLet's narrow down to the following search API calls for now:\n\n- `search_class(\"Entity\")`\n- `search_class(\"User\")`\n- `search_code(\"AppConfig\")`\n- `search_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\")`\n\nWith the results from these API calls, we should get a better understanding of how the inheritance of the primary key is handled across different models and how the Django settings and configurations are structured concerning auto-generated primary keys."
