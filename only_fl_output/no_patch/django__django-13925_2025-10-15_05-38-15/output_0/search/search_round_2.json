        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Search for Class \"Entity\"\nThe search for the `Entity` class returned no results. This suggests that the class may be part of a custom implementation not found in the standard Django library, which indicates it might be defined in a project-specific module or package. Since the `Entity` class could not be found, but is mentioned as a parent class for `User`, it's critical to understand its structure to resolve the inheritance issue mentioned. The absence of `Entity` details in the result means we need to adjust our approach to either locate this class via more general search terms related to model inheritance or primary key definitions in the project's custom modules.\n\n#### 2. Search Result for Class \"User\"\nThe search returned the Django `User` model, which inherits from `AbstractUser`. This doesn't directly help with our issue because the report describes an inherited primary key from an `Entity` class. However, it indicates that the `User` model mentioned in the issue might not be referring to Django's built-in `User` model but rather a custom implementation that extends another base class (`Entity`). Understanding that Django's `User` model is not the focus could reorient our troubleshooting efforts towards the project-specific customization of user models.\n\n#### 3. Search Result for \"AppConfig\"\nThe term `AppConfig` appeared in numerous files across the Django framework, showcasing its widespread use for application configuration, including model settings. Given the issue's suggestion to configure `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the `AppConfig` subclasses, understanding where and how `AppConfig` is defined in relation to the models mentioned in the issue (e.g., `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig`, `SpeedyCoreMessagesConfig`) is crucial. These configurations are likely defining or could define the `default_auto_field` attribute to manage how primary keys are auto-generated. This aspect is directly related to the bug since the reported warning suggests adjusting the default auto-field type used for models.\n\n#### 4. Search Result for \"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\"\nThe presence of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in four files related to model and application configuration hints at the global and model-specific settings that control the behavior of auto-created primary keys in Django. The `models.base.py`, `models.options.py`, and `global_settings.py` files likely define the default behavior and available options for auto field configuration, pointing to a solution path for the reported bug. Adjusting these settings to specify a primary key type, such as `BigAutoField`, would directly address the warning by making explicit the type of auto-created primary key where it's not defined.\n\n### Adjusted Approach for Further Context\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Potential Follow-up on \"Entity\" Class:** We need more information about the `Entity` class. Since it was not found, it might be useful to search for keywords or terms related to model inheritance or primary key declarations that are custom to the project.\n- **Custom User Model & Inheritance:** It's vital to focus on the project's custom user model(s) that likely inherit from the `Entity` class or a similar base model, not Django\u2019s built-in `User` model.\n- **Project-Specific AppConfigs:** Understanding how `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is set or can be set in the project's specific `AppConfig` subclasses could guide towards a resolution. Looking into project-specific app configurations or settings files could reveal how auto fields are managed across these models.\n\nGiven this adjusted understanding, further actions could involve identifying custom models more closely, reviewing the project's settings or configurations for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`, and better understanding how primary keys are configured in the inheritance chain that includes the `Entity` class."

However, based on the issue description and analysis of the available context, we can infer the following general locations and intended behaviors:\n\n- **Buggy Locations:**\n    - **File:** Files containing model definitions that inherit from `Entity` (Since `Entity` class definition and file location are not obtained, this is a hypothetical location based on the problem description).\n    - **Classes:** `User`, and other classes listed in the warning messages, assuming they inherit from `Entity` or a similar base model.\n    - **Global or App-specific settings files**: Where `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` settings are defined.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n    - For the `Entity` class (and its inheritors):\n        - Ensure the primary key defined in `Entity` is correctly inherited by all descendant models, such that Django does not attempt to auto-create a primary key.\n        - Explicitly define `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the `AppConfig` classes related to these models, pointing it to use a subclass of `AutoField` that matches the project's requirements (e.g., `BigAutoField`). This should happen in the configurations of apps like `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig`, `SpeedyCoreMessagesConfig`, and others mentioned in the issue.\n    - **For Global or App-Specific Settings**:\n        - If not already set, specify a global `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the project's settings to an appropriate field type that aligns with the project's database schema and data needs. This change aims to ensure that all models, unless specifically overridden, will use the defined auto field type, possibly reducing the need for model-by-model configurations.\n\nMaking these adjustments should directly address the warnings by ensuring a consistent approach to primary key definitions across the project, fulfilling Django\u2019s requirements for primary key specification, and by extension, resolving the reported issue."

The lack of finding the `Entity` class complicates understanding how primary keys are being inherited by subclasses or if indeed the class exists and is responsible for the described behavior.\n\n2. **Search for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD =`**\n\n    - **Result:** The search found a snippet in `django/conf/global_settings.py` setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to `'django.db.models.AutoField'`.\n    - **Analysis:** This setting specifies the default type of auto-generated primary keys for models that do not explicitly define one. The relationship of this setting to the bug is direct: the models mentioned in the issue do not define a primary key type and hence, by default, use `AutoField`. The intended behavior, given the issue, would be to either adjust this setting at a project-wide level in the settings module to use a different subclass of `AutoField` (like `BigAutoField`), or explicitly define the primary key type for each affected model to avoid the warning.\n\n3. **Search for `class Meta`:**\n\n    - **Result:** The search returned 26 instances of `class Meta` defined across various models and forms in the Django framework and possibly the project's codebase.\n    - **Analysis:** `class Meta` inside Django models is used to specify model-specific options (metadata), such as database table names (`db_table`), unique constraints (`unique_together`), ordering of records (`ordering`), verbose names (`verbose_name`), and more importantly for this issue, the `default_auto_field` for a model, which can override the global `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting.\n    - The intended behavior, particularly given the issue's context, would involve using these `Meta` class definitions within the models raising warnings, to explicitly define `default_auto_field` properties that match the type desired for primary keys (e.g., `BigAutoField`). This adjustment would resolve the warnings by ensuring the project uses an appropriate auto-generated field type for primary keys across its models, complying with the hint provided in the warning messages.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analyses, there's a clear path toward resolving the issue:\n\n- The **non-discovery of `Entity`** implies either re-examining the models for an accurate inheritance chain or revalidating the class name.\n\n- Adjusting the **`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`** setting in the project's settings file to `BigAutoField` can resolve the warnings globally, assuming this change aligns with the desired database schema specifications.\n\n- Utilizing the `class Meta` inside models raising warnings to specifically set `default_auto_field` to `BigAutoField` provides a more targeted approach, resolving the issue for specific models without affecting the global setting.\n\nGiven the issue description and the project's reliance on dynamic or inherited primary keys, ensuring a consistent approach either through global settings or model-specific `Meta` classes would be the intended behavior to resolve the issue."

However, we can infer general locations and approaches that would address the issue:\n\n- **Global Settings File:** `django/conf/global_settings.py` (indicative location for reference; actual changes should be in the project's settings file, not the Django source)\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Update or add `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` in the project's settings.py file. This change ensures that all models in the project will use `BigAutoField` as the default type for auto-generated primary keys, unless overridden. This aligns with Django's suggestion for new projects to accommodate larger datasets.\n\n- **Models Inheriting from `Entity` or Showing Warnings:**\n    - Since the `Entity` class was not found, and specific models were mentioned in the issue without exact locations, the general intended behavior for models issuing warnings (e.g., `User`, `ReservedUsername`, `Block`, `Feedback`, `ReadMark`, `Friend`, etc.) is as follows:\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Inside each model class issuing a `models.W042` warning, ensure or add a `class Meta:` block that defines `default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`. This explicit definition within models overrides the global setting for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`, addressing warnings for models where a larger or different primary key type is specifically desired.\n    - Example:\n        ```python\n        class SomeModel(models.Model):\n            # model fields here\n\n            class Meta:\n                default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'\n        ```\n    - This behavior will preserve the existing functionality of the code while resolving the issue related to the primary key field type.\n\nThese adjustments directly tackle the warning by ensuring all models either follow a new global default or explicitly specify their primary key field type as recommended. Since the search did not reveal an `Entity` class, model-specific adjustments or global setting changes are the prescribed routes to resolution."
