In that case, the default of `aspect=None` should just mean \"don't modify the aspect\".\n[1] Really, this should be \"something that does not contains transData as a branch\", as in #13642.\nThe current behavior is the reason why #14057 and #14117 need to explicitly set the aspect to \"auto\" in or after the last imshow() call (otherwise, some head-scratching occurs).\nOn the other hand, making this change would once again lead to some seriously non-obvious interaction between parameters (the meaning of `aspect=None` depends on the value of `transform`), which I'm not sure is great either :/\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system: linux\n* Matplotlib version: master/any\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): qt5agg\n* Python version: 37\n</issue>"

This parameter is particularly\n5572             relevant for images since it determines whether data pixels are\n5573             square.\n5574 \n5575             This parameter is a shortcut for explicitly calling\n5576             `.Axes.set_aspect`. See there for further details.\n5577 \n5578             - 'equal': Ensures an aspect ratio of 1.

Note that different ps,\n5600             pdf, and svg viewers may display these raw pixels differently. On\n5601             other backends, 'none' is the same as 'nearest'.\n5602 \n5603             If *interpolation* is the default 'antialiased', then 'nearest'\n5604             interpolation is used if the image is upsampled by more than a\n5605             factor of three (i.e. the number of display pixels is at least\n5606             three times the size of the data array).  If the upsampling rate is\n5607             smaller than 3, or the image is downsampled, then 'hanning'\n5608             interpolation is used to act as an anti-aliasing filter, unless the\n5609             image happens to be upsampled by exactly a factor of two or one.\n5610 \n5611             See\n5612             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods`\n5613             for an overview of the supported interpolation methods, and\n5614             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing` for\n5615             a discussion of image antialiasing.\n5616 \n5617             Some interpolation methods require an additional radius parameter,\n5618             which can be set by *filterrad*. Additionally, the antigrain image\n5619             resize filter is controlled by the parameter *filternorm*.\n5620 \n5621         interpolation_stage : {'data', 'rgba'}, default: 'data'\n5622             If 'data', interpolation\n5623             is carried out on the data provided by the user.  If 'rgba', the\n5624             interpolation is carried out after the colormapping has been\n5625             applied (visual interpolation).\n5626 \n5627         alpha : float or array-like, optional\n5628             The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).\n5629             If *alpha* is an array, the alpha blending values are applied pixel\n5630             by pixel, and *alpha* must have the same shape as *X*.\n5631 \n5632         origin : {'upper', 'lower'}, default: :rc:`image.origin`\n5633             Place the [0, 0] index of the array in the upper left or lower\n5634             left corner of the Axes.

Their centers are on\n5650             integer coordinates, and their center coordinates range from 0 to\n5651             columns-1 horizontally and from 0 to rows-1 vertically.\n5652 \n5653             Note that the direction of the vertical axis and thus the default\n5654             values for top and bottom depend on *origin*:\n5655 \n5656             - For ``origin == 'upper'`` the default is\n5657               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, numrows-0.5, -0.5)``.\n5658             - For ``origin == 'lower'`` the default is\n5659               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, -0.5, numrows-0.5)``.\n5660 \n5661             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5662             examples and a more detailed description.\n5663 \n5664         filternorm : bool, default: True\n5665             A parameter for the antigrain image resize filter (see the\n5666             antigrain documentation).  If *filternorm* is set, the filter\n5667             normalizes integer values and corrects the rounding errors. It\n5668             doesn't do anything with the source floating point values, it\n5669             corrects only integers according to the rule of 1.0 which means\n5670             that any sum of pixel weights must be equal to 1.0.  So, the\n5671             filter function must produce a graph of the proper shape.\n5672 \n5673         filterrad : float > 0, default: 4.0\n5674             The filter radius for filters that have a radius parameter, i.e.\n5675             when interpolation is one of: 'sinc', 'lanczos' or 'blackman'.\n5676 \n5677         resample : bool, default: :rc:`image.resample`\n5678             When *True*, use a full resampling method.

See parameters *norm*,\n5548               *cmap*, *vmin*, *vmax*.\n5549             - (M, N, 3): an image with RGB values (0-1 float or 0-255 int).\n5550             - (M, N, 4): an image with RGBA values (0-1 float or 0-255 int),\n5551               i.e. including transparency.\n5552 \n5553             The first two dimensions (M, N) define the rows and columns of\n5554             the image.\n5555 \n5556             Out-of-range RGB(A) values are clipped.\n5557 \n5558         %(cmap_doc)s\n5559 \n5560             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5561 \n5562         %(norm_doc)s\n5563 \n5564             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5565 \n5566         %(vmin_vmax_doc)s\n5567 \n5568             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5569 \n5570         aspect : {'equal', 'auto'} or float, default: :rc:`image.aspect`\n5571             The aspect ratio of the Axes.  This parameter is particularly\n5572             relevant for images since it determines whether data pixels are\n5573             square.\n5574 \n5575             This parameter is a shortcut for explicitly calling\n5576             `.Axes.set_aspect`. See there for further details.\n5577 \n5578             - 'equal': Ensures an aspect ratio of 1. Pixels will be square\n5579               (unless pixel sizes are explicitly made non-square in data\n5580               coordinates using *extent*).\n5581             - 'auto': The Axes is kept fixed and the aspect is adjusted so\n5582               that the data fit in the Axes. In general, this will result in\n5583               non-square pixels.\n5584 \n5585         interpolation : str, default: :rc:`image.interpolation`\n5586             The interpolation method used.\n5587 \n5588             Supported values are 'none', 'antialiased', 'nearest', 'bilinear',\n5589             'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite',\n5590             'kaiser', 'quadric', 'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell',\n5591             'sinc', 'lanczos', 'blackman'.\n5592 \n5593             The data *X* is resampled to the pixel size of the image on the\n5594             figure canvas, using the interpolation method to either up- or\n5595             downsample the data.\n5596 \n5597             If *interpolation* is 'none', then for the ps, pdf, and svg\n5598             backends no down- or upsampling occurs, and the image data is\n5599             passed to the backend as a native image.  Note that different ps,\n5600             pdf, and svg viewers may display these raw pixels differently. On\n5601             other backends, 'none' is the same as 'nearest'.\n5602 \n5603             If *interpolation* is the default 'antialiased', then 'nearest'\n5604             interpolation is used if the image is upsampled by more than a\n5605             factor of three (i.e. the number of display pixels is at least\n5606             three times the size of the data array).  If the upsampling rate is\n5607             smaller than 3, or the image is downsampled, then 'hanning'\n5608             interpolation is used to act as an anti-aliasing filter, unless the\n5609             image happens to be upsampled by exactly a factor of two or one.\n5610 \n5611             See\n5612             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods`\n5613             for an overview of the supported interpolation methods, and\n5614             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing` for\n5615             a discussion of image antialiasing.\n5616 \n5617             Some interpolation methods require an additional radius parameter,\n5618             which can be set by *filterrad*. Additionally, the antigrain image\n5619             resize filter is controlled by the parameter *filternorm*.\n5620 \n5621         interpolation_stage : {'data', 'rgba'}, default: 'data'\n5622             If 'data', interpolation\n5623             is carried out on the data provided by the user.  If 'rgba', the\n5624             interpolation is carried out after the colormapping has been\n5625             applied (visual interpolation).\n5626 \n5627         alpha : float or array-like, optional\n5628             The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).\n5629             If *alpha* is an array, the alpha blending values are applied pixel\n5630             by pixel, and *alpha* must have the same shape as *X*.\n5631 \n5632         origin : {'upper', 'lower'}, default: :rc:`image.origin`\n5633             Place the [0, 0] index of the array in the upper left or lower\n5634             left corner of the Axes. The convention (the default) 'upper' is\n5635             typically used for matrices and images.\n5636 \n5637             Note that the vertical axis points upward for 'lower'\n5638             but downward for 'upper'.\n5639 \n5640             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5641             examples and a more detailed description.\n5642 \n5643         extent : floats (left, right, bottom, top), optional\n5644             The bounding box in data coordinates that the image will fill.\n5645             These values may be unitful and match the units of the Axes.\n5646             The image is stretched individually along x and y to fill the box.\n5647 \n5648             The default extent is determined by the following conditions.\n5649             Pixels have unit size in data coordinates. Their centers are on\n5650             integer coordinates, and their center coordinates range from 0 to\n5651             columns-1 horizontally and from 0 to rows-1 vertically.\n5652 \n5653             Note that the direction of the vertical axis and thus the default\n5654             values for top and bottom depend on *origin*:\n5655 \n5656             - For ``origin == 'upper'`` the default is\n5657               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, numrows-0.5, -0.5)``.\n5658             - For ``origin == 'lower'`` the default is\n5659               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, -0.5, numrows-0.5)``.\n5660 \n5661             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5662             examples and a more detailed description.\n5663 \n5664         filternorm : bool, default: True\n5665             A parameter for the antigrain image resize filter (see the\n5666             antigrain documentation).  If *filternorm* is set, the filter\n5667             normalizes integer values and corrects the rounding errors. It\n5668             doesn't do anything with the source floating point values, it\n5669             corrects only integers according to the rule of 1.0 which means\n5670             that any sum of pixel weights must be equal to 1.0.  So, the\n5671             filter function must produce a graph of the proper shape.\n5672 \n5673         filterrad : float > 0, default: 4.0\n5674             The filter radius for filters that have a radius parameter, i.e.\n5675             when interpolation is one of: 'sinc', 'lanczos' or 'blackman'.\n5676 \n5677         resample : bool, default: :rc:`image.resample`\n5678             When *True*, use a full resampling method.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `imshow()` method implementations and the failed attempt to find the `set_aspect` method directly reveals several important aspects concerning the bug and the intended behavior changes discussed in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `imshow()` Implementation\n\nThe `imshow()` method is implemented in two places:\n- `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`\n- `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`\n\nBoth implementations play a role in how images are displayed within a Matplotlib figure. The main action seems to occur in the `axes/_axes.py` version, where the handling of `aspect`, among other parameters, is directly managed. \n\n#### What the Code Does:\n1. **pyplot Implementation**: This version of `imshow()` essentially delegates the drawing to the current axes (`gca().imshow(...)`) while forwarding all received parameters. This implementation plays a gateway role for the high-level `pyplot` interface.\n\n2. **axes/_axes.py Implementation**: Here, the `aspect` parameter if not provided (`None`) defaults to the value specified by `mpl.rcParams['image.aspect']`. This `aspect` value affects how the image's data pixels are configured \u2013 to be square (`'equal'`) or adjusted such that the data fits in the Axes (`'auto'`), or as specified by a numerical value directly defining the aspect ratio. The method sets the aspect of the axes object itself (`self.set_aspect(aspect)`) before proceeding with the image data handling and rendering process.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\nThe issue points out that when the `imshow()` function's `transform` parameter is set to something other than the default `ax.transData`, adjusting the aspect based on default behavior (`aspect=None` leading to square pixels) doesn't make sense. This is because the image will not adhere to the data coordinates' scaling, making the forcing of square pixels potentially incorrect or misleading. The behavior described in `axes/_axes.py` does not currently account for the impact of a non-default `transform`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would revolve around modifying the `imshow()` function (presumably within `axes/_axes.py`) such that the default handling of the `aspect` parameter (`None` leading to `'equal'`) considers whether a custom `transform` parameter is provided. If a custom `transform` is provided, it should override any automatic adjustments to the aspect ratio based on the assumption of square pixels. This means not enforcing square pixel aspect ratios (or possibly any aspect ratio adjustments) when the image won't be aligned with data coordinates.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\nGiven the missing context about how aspect ratios are actually set (`set_aspect` method not found within `Axes` through direct search), and considering the issue's detail about transforms, we could look closer into the relationship between `imshow`, aspect ratio setting (`Axes.set_aspect`), and potentially how transforms are handled. \n\nSince we couldn't find `set_aspect` in `Axes`, we should:\n- Investigate the Axes class further to understand how aspect ratios are handled, especially if `set_aspect` is indirectly referred to or managed under a different mechanism within the class.\n- Look into how transforms interact with setting aspects in `imshow` or more broadly within `Axes`, if such interaction details are internally documented or represented in the codebase.\n\nTo move forward, we should:\n- `search_class(\"Axes\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"set_aspect\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\")` assuming that aspect related functionalities are also part of base class implementations.\n\nThis approach should provide insight into how aspect ratios are managed in conjunction with transforms, potentially uncovering the root cause of the bug and guiding towards a solution for the discussed issue."

The current behavior automatically applies the aspect ratio based on `mpl.rcParams['image.aspect']` when `aspect` is `None`, defaulting to `'equal'` which makes pixels square. The intended behavior is to modify this logic to check if a custom `transform` is provided and, if so, to avoid modifying the aspect ratio unless explicitly requested by the user. This change should preserve the existing functionality where the transform is the default (`ax.transData`), thus not altering the behavior for existing code that relies on this method without specifying a custom transform. The modification should specifically target scenarios where a transform other than `ax.transData` is used, in which case the automatic assumption of square pixels might not be appropriate.\n\nGiven the current context and understanding of the described issue, these adjustments aim at addressing the aspect ratio concerns raised without impacting the functionality in cases where the existing behavior is expected and relied upon."
