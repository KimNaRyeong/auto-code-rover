imshow() should not modify axes aspect if transform != ax.transData.
Currently, imshow() automatically updates the axes aspect via the `aspect` kwarg; its default, None, means `rcParams["image.aspect"]`, which is "equal" by default (i.e., square image pixels).

If the `transform` kwarg is also passed, and set to something else[1] than `ax.transData` (the default), then setting the aspect is clearly not useful (the image is not going to be drawn in data coordinates so it should not affect the relative size of x- and y-data).  In that case, the default of `aspect=None` should just mean "don't modify the aspect".

[1] Really, this should be "something that does not contains transData as a branch", as in #13642.

The current behavior is the reason why #14057 and #14117 need to explicitly set the aspect to "auto" in or after the last imshow() call (otherwise, some head-scratching occurs).

On the other hand, making this change would once again lead to some seriously non-obvious interaction between parameters (the meaning of `aspect=None` depends on the value of `transform`), which I'm not sure is great either :/
