To address the outlined scenario in your request, we will construct a `reproducer.py` Python script designed to programmatically reproduce the issue described with the Pylint tool. This script will invoke Pylint in a subprocess, attempting to use the `-v` option in the way you've described. It will check for the presence of the reported error message and handle the outcome accordingly.

Given the constraints and the requirements you've provided, we will implement the functionality to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and ensure that the script exits with code `0` when the issue is fixed. We will make use of the `print_stacktrace` function you've provided for consistency in error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py

import subprocess
import sys

def run_pylint():
    try:
        # Attempt to run Pylint with the `-v` option and capture the output.
        command = ['pylint', 'mytest.py', '-v']
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

        # If no exception is raised, we assume Pylint ran successfully. Check stdout/stderr to be sure.
        output = result.stdout or result.stderr
        if "expected one argument" in output:
            raise AssertionError("Pylint unexpectedly requires an argument for the `-v` option.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # If an error is captured, we check for the specific message to see if it matches the reported issue.
        if "expected one argument" in e.stderr:
            print("Reproduced the reported issue successfully.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            print("The Pylint command failed, but not with the expected issue description.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any other kind of unexpected error.
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        # If Pylint runs without raising the specific error, we consider the issue fixed.
        print("Issue not found, possibly fixed in this version of Pylint.")
        sys.exit(0)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pylint()
```

Please ensure you create a `mytest.py` file in the same directory where you run `reproducer.py`, or the script will potentially fail because Pylint has no target file to lint. Adjust the script or your setup as necessary if your environment differs or if specific configurations are required to run Pylint in your environment.
