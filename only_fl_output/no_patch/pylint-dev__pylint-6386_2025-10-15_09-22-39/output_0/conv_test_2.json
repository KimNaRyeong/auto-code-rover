This script includes a dynamic attempt to locate the Pylint executable in the environment path, thus circumventing the previous issue where Pylint could not be located. Note that for this script to work, Pylint must be installed and accessible in your environment's PATH, or you should adjust the script to target your specific Pylint executable location.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef run_pylint_with_short_verbose():\n    import subprocess\n    import sys\n    from shutil import which\n\n    # Dynamically locate the Pylint executable in the environment PATH\n    pylint_executable = which('pylint')\n    if not pylint_executable:\n        print(\"Pylint executable not found.

It maintains the structure of executing Pylint with the problematic `-v` option and asserts the expected behavior. Upon encountering the specific error scenario, it outputs a detailed stack trace as instructed. Note that for environments where Pylint is not installed or properly configured in the system's PATH, you might need to adjust the script or your environment accordingly."
