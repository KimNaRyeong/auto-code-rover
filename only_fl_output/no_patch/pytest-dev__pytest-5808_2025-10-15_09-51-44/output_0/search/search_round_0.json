This would seem like the right thing to do in any case: the console output of a `pytest` run that is being uploaded is not Python code, but arbitrary text.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to gather context around the use of the `lexer=python3` parameter in the `--pastebin` feature and consider where and how it is implemented in the `pytest` project. Based on the information provided in the issue description, it seems relevant to look at the implementation of the pastebin functionality within the pytest codebase. Specifically, the linked code snippet in `pastebin.py` and any code that calls or is related to it. Given this, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the code snippet where `lexer=python3` is set to understand its usage context:\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"lexer=python3\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")\n```\n\n2. Get the code around the specific line number mentioned (around lines 68-73) to understand the immediate context of the issue:\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\", 68, 5)\n```\n\n3. To address any potential fixes, it would also be helpful to understand how the `--pastebin` feature is implemented as a whole:\n```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"PastebinPlugin\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")\n```\n\n4. Since the issue description mentions that changing `lexer=python3` to `text` could resolve the HTTP Error 400, it's essential to understand where this decision is made and if there are any conditionals involved:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"create_new_paste\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")\n```\n\n5. Finally, understanding how the `--pastebin` option is parsed and handled might provide additional insight into possible improvements or related components:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"pytest_addoption\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the `--pastebin` feature's current implementation and the context necessary to consider the appropriate fix for the issue reported."
