Given the updated requirements and aiming to strictly follow the instructions to create a test script that reproduces the mentioned issue and responds accordingly, here is an adapted version of `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to read a specially prepared `data.txt` file which should mimic the problematic content as per the issue description, and it directly interacts with the `bpaste.net` service using the originally problematic `lexer=python3`. 

It's crucial to remember that the success of reproducing the issue heavily depends on the availability and response behavior of the targeted service (`bpaste.net` in this case) and the specific content that triggers the error. The content that could potentially cause the issue (as per the issue description) should be saved in a file named `data.txt` located in the same directory as this script.

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import json
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    data = ''
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        data = urllib.parse.urlencode({
            'lexer': 'python3',
            'code': content
        }).encode()

    url = "https://bpaste.net"

    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=data)
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
            # Expecting to get an error or a success response
            if response.status == 200:
                # Successfully posted content without HTTP Error, implies issue might be fixed.
                print("No HTTP Error 400: Bad Request - issue might be fixed.")
                sys.exit(0)
            else:
                # If we hit this branch, something unexpected happened.
                print("Received an unexpected response code:", response.status)
                sys.exit(1)
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        if e.code == 400:
            # Expected error, indicating the issue with lexer=python3 is present.
            raise AssertionError("Issue is present. Received HTTP Error 400: Bad Request.") from e
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(e.code)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script meets the criteria:

- It tries to submit content to `bpaste.net` with `lexer` set to `python3`.
- If a "HTTP Error 400: Bad Request" specifically occurs, it indicates the issue is present, leading to raising an `AssertionError`.
- Proper stack trace printing upon encountering exceptions.
- Exits with code 0 if the submission is successful without triggering the error, implying the issue might have been resolved.

Make sure you have a `data.txt` file with content known to reproduce the issue as per your original problem description.
