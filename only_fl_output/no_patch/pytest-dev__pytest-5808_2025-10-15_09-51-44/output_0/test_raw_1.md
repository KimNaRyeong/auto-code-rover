Given the previous misunderstanding, let's formulate a script that more closely mimics the original problem description where the issue arises specifically with certain contents and the `lexer` set to `python3`.

We'll replicate the condition by directly using content that triggers the "HTTP Error 400: Bad Request" when sent with the `lexer=python3` parameter, similar to what has been described. This scenario should assume that the content is already known to cause issues based on the provided details.

```python
# reproducer.py
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import sys
import json

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Assuming `content` is a placeholder for the problematic data
    content = '{"content":"Sample pytest output that causes issue with lexer=python3"}'
    
    # Data encoded with lexer=python3, mimicking the original issue
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode({
        'lexer': 'python3', 
        'code': content
    }).encode()
    
    url = "https://bpaste.net"
    
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(urllib.request.Request(url, data=data))
        
        # If an error specifically related to HTTP 400 occurs, it implies the issue is present.
        # However, actually expecting a 400 here; the correct flow would consider its resolution.
        if response.getcode() == 400:
            print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
            exit(1)
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        if e.code == 400:
            # Expected error, issue still present
            print("Correctly identified HTTP Error 400: Bad Request - issue present.")
            raise AssertionError("Issue is present") from e
        else:
            # Unexpected error, print stacktrace for diagnosis
            print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        # No errors encountered; this implies that the issue may have been resolved
        print("No HTTP Error 400: Bad Request - issue might be fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate potential resolution

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script tries to closely replicate the conditions under which the original issue was identified, focusing on sending a request with `lexer=python3` that would traditionally result in an HTTP 400 error due to the contents being problematic for parsing as Python 3 code by `bpaste.net`. When running this script:

- If the "HTTP Error 400: Bad Request" is correctly caught for the given content and lexer settings, it indicates the issue is still present, leading to an `AssertionError`.
- If no error occurs (meaning the server returns a different status code that is not 400), the script concludes that the issue might be fixed and exits with code `0`.
