However, directly reproducing static analysis checks like pylint's `unused-import` warning within a Python script (i.e., during runtime) is not straightforward because these checks are meant to be done in a static context, not at runtime.\n\nInstead, the script below attempts to automate the reproduction by running `pylint` as a subprocess on a temporary Python file containing the given code. It checks `pylint`'s output for the specific warning. This approach is a bit unconventional and outside the typical use of Python's runtime error handling (like catching an `AssertionError`), yet it aligns with the requirement to demonstrate whether the issue is present.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef run_pylint_on_code(code: str):\n    \"\"\"Runs pylint on the supplied code and returns the output.\"\"\"\n    tmp_filename = 'tmp_reproducer.py'\n    with open(tmp_filename, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(code)\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(['pylint', tmp_filename], capture_output=True, text=True)\n        output = result.stdout + result.stderr\n    finally:\n        os.remove(tmp_filename)\n    return output\n\ndef check_issue():\n    python_code = \"\"\"\n\\\"\\\"\\\"Docstring.\\\"\\\"\\\"\n\nimport abc\nfrom abc import ABC\n\nX = ...  # type: abc.ABC\nY = ...  # type: ABC\n\"\"\"\n    pylint_output = run_pylint_on_code(python_code)\n    if \"W0611: Unused import abc (unused-import)\" in pylint_output:\n        raise AssertionError(\"The unused-import false positive issue is present.\")\n\ntry:\n    check_issue()\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate the presence of the issue.\nelse:\n    print(\"The issue is fixed.\")\n    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed.\n\n```\n\nThis script creates a temporary Python file containing the code snippet that is problematic according to the pylint version specified, runs pylint on that file, and checks for the presence of the `unused-import` warning. If found, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace. Note that for this script to work, `pylint` must be installed in the environment where the script is executed."
