To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that can be used to reproduce the described issue, you would need to simulate running `pylint` on a small snippet of code and check if the specific warning about an unused import is raised or not. However, directly reproducing static analysis checks like pylint's `unused-import` warning within a Python script (i.e., during runtime) is not straightforward because these checks are meant to be done in a static context, not at runtime.

Instead, the script below attempts to automate the reproduction by running `pylint` as a subprocess on a temporary Python file containing the given code. It checks `pylint`'s output for the specific warning. This approach is a bit unconventional and outside the typical use of Python's runtime error handling (like catching an `AssertionError`), yet it aligns with the requirement to demonstrate whether the issue is present.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pylint_on_code(code: str):
    """Runs pylint on the supplied code and returns the output."""
    tmp_filename = 'tmp_reproducer.py'
    with open(tmp_filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(code)
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['pylint', tmp_filename], capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stdout + result.stderr
    finally:
        os.remove(tmp_filename)
    return output

def check_issue():
    python_code = """
\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    pylint_output = run_pylint_on_code(python_code)
    if "W0611: Unused import abc (unused-import)" in pylint_output:
        raise AssertionError("The unused-import false positive issue is present.")

try:
    check_issue()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate the presence of the issue.
else:
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed.

```

This script creates a temporary Python file containing the code snippet that is problematic according to the pylint version specified, runs pylint on that file, and checks for the presence of the `unused-import` warning. If found, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace. Note that for this script to work, `pylint` must be installed in the environment where the script is executed.
