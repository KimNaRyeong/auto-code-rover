Given the constraints and the requirements to make a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that programmatically attempts to reproduce a specified static analysis issue -- particularly, a false positive for an "unused-import" warning by Pylint for a module used in a type comment -- below is a crafted script designed to fit within these parameters. 

This approach uses dynamic execution to simulate the behavior of linting and response handling in a Python script. Nonetheless, it's important to remember that true static analysis issues are best verified by directly running the static analysis tools (like Pylint) against the problem code, as this simulation relies on executing a subprocess which might not perfectly emulate all environmental factors.

    for frame in tb:

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"

        raise AssertionError("Error running pylint. Ensure pylint is installed and accessible.") from e

This script attempts to check for the specific issue by dynamically writing the problematic code to a file, running `pylint` on it through a subprocess, and interpreting the output to determine if the specific warning is present. It also cleans up by deleting the temporary file after the check. Note, however, that the success of this approach depends on having the correct version of `pylint` installed and accessible in the environment from which this script is run.
