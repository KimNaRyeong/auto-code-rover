This script will test the issue with `lambdify` incorrectly interpreting identity matrices by comparing the output against the expected result. It uses `numpy.array_equal` for comparison which is suitable for numerical arrays. If the issue persists, the assertion will fail, printing a stack trace of where the issue occurred. If the script does not raise an `AssertionError`, it will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.
