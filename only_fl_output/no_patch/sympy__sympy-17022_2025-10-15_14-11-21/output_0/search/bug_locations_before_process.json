        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function needs to correctly distinguish between the symbolic `Identity` matrix and the complex unit `I`. This could be achieved by enhancing the namespace translation and string conversion processes inside `lambdify` to ensure that `Identity` matrices are properly translated into a function that adds an identity matrix of appropriate dimensions in the numeric library being used, such as NumPy. This requires a conditional check or a more sophisticated mapping for symbols that have ambiguous representations between symbolic and numeric contexts. Ideally, a specific case for handling `Identity(n)` should be added to prevent it from being interpreted as `1j`."

        "intended_behavior": "The printing functionality for `Identity` matrices within the `NumPyPrinter` class (or whichever specific printer `lambdify` utilizes for converting SymPy expressions to NumPy functions) should explicitly convert `Identity(n)` matrices into NumPy syntax for creating identity matrices (`numpy.eye(n)`). The printer should have a clear and unambiguous rule for printing `Identity` matrices that differentiates them from the notation for the imaginary unit `I`, ensuring the generated code reflects the intention of adding an identity matrix rather than complex numbers to the elements of the array."
