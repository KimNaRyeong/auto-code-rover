This corrected version incorporates precise evaluation and comparison of the matrix computation handled by the `lambdify` function along with a proper setup for handling exceptions and stack traces. It's designed to reproduce the issue detailed in your request, and it should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists or confirm the issue is resolved otherwise.

Ensure you have `numpy` and `sympy` installed in your environment where you are executing this script. If you encountered an error related to missing modules (`ModuleNotFoundError`), it likely means that the required packages are not installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy sympy
```
