Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to check for the reported issue with the `exp` function not simplifying based on its periodicity in SymPy. The script asserts the expected behavior, prints a stack trace if the assertion fails (indicating the issue is present), and exits with code 0 if the assertion passes (indicating the issue is fixed).

```python
import sys
from sympy import exp, I, pi, simplify, expand_complex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_simplify_exp():
    try:
        # Current behavior
        original_exp = exp(9*I*pi/4)
        simplified_exp = simplify(exp(9*I*pi/4))
        
        # Asserting if simplification works as expected
        # The expected result should be exp(I*pi/4) or equivalent
        assert simplified_exp == exp(I*pi/4), "exp did not simplify correctly based on its periodicity"
        
        # Testing with subtraction to see if simplification through periodicity is followed
        a = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)
        simplified_a = simplify(a)
        # Given the periodicity, this simplification should result in 0
        assert simplified_a == 0, "Subtraction example did not simplify to 0"
        
        # Additionally, using expand_complex to assert its correct simplification to 0
        expanded_complex_a = expand_complex(a)
        assert expanded_complex_a == 0, "expand_complex did not simplify to 0"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_simplify_exp()
    print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script tests the issue by:
1. Performing an initial simplification of `exp(9*I*pi/4)` to see if it simplifies correctly based on its periodicity.
2. Checking if the expression `exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)` simplifies to `0`, highlighting the periodic behavior.
3. Utilizing `expand_complex` on the subtraction to further assert that it simplifies to `0`.

On running, it:
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, with a detailed stack trace.
- Prints "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0." and exits with code 0 if the tests pass, indicating the issue is resolved.
