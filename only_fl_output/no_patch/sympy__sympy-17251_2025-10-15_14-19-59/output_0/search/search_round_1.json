The intended behavior here would include correctly applying exponential function properties, such as Euler's formula (e^(i\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) + i*sin(\u03b8)) and its periodicity, to simplify expressions like `exp(I*pi)` automatically.\n\n2. **simplify Method in sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: \n   - This file likely contains the main simplification logic that `sympy` uses to reduce expressions into simpler forms. \n   - In relation to the bug, this method might lack optimization for exploiting the periodicity of exponential functions with imaginary numbers. The intended behavior for this part should include identifying when an exponential function can be simplified based on its periodic properties and applying these simplifications automatically.\n\n3. **expand_complex Function in sympy/core/function.py**:\n   - This function wraps around `expand`, targeting complex number expansion specifically. It demonstrates how complex expressions, possibly including exponentials, are expanded to separate real and imaginary parts.\n   - It is indirectly related to the issue in that correct expansion of complex numbers can depend on recognizing and applying the periodic nature of `exp` with purely imaginary arguments. The intended behavior would include ensuring that after expansion, if applicable, the expressions are simplified considering the properties of exponential functions.\n\nGiven the issue description and the context of the project, the main concern is that the `exp` function does not automatically simplify expressions based on its periodicity, which is a fundamental property of exponential functions when the input is an imaginary number. Combining this with the simplification routines (simplify and expand_complex), it's apparent that enhancements or adjustments might be needed in how `exp` integrations with imaginary arguments are recognized and simplified in Sympy.\n\nTo resolve the issue, one would need to ensure that:\n- `exp` implementations accurately reflect mathematical properties, such as Euler's formula and periodicity.\n- `simplify` and `expand_complex` methods leverage these properties for optimization during simplification processes.\n\nTo gather more specific code context for patching, inspecting the implementation details of `exp` in the `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file, and the simplification logic particularly looking for how imaginary arguments are handled in both `exp` and `simplify`, would be the next steps. Additional code context around these implementations can help identify where the improvements need to be made to address the issue described."
