Since the issue involves handling the periodicity of the exponential function, particularly with imaginary arguments, we should look into the implementations of `exp`, `simplify`, and any relevant simplification rules for complex numbers.\n\nTo start, let's find which file or class contains the implementation of the `exp` function, as well as where the `simplify` and `expand_complex` methods are defined or used. This will give us the necessary context to understand where and how the periodicity behavior should be improved.\n\n1. search_method(\"exp\")\n2. search_method(\"simplify\")\n3. search_method(\"expand_complex\")"
