        "intended_behavior": "The `__getattr__` method's intended behavior should accurately differentiate and report the actual missing attribute during custom attribute access. When within the scope of `__getattr__`, if the resolution of a requested attribute fails (especially in cases where the attribute is being accessed from within a custom property or method defined in subclasses), the method should ensure the error message correctly identifies the missing attribute and not the property or method from which the missing attribute was accessed.\n\nThis requires refining how the method handles attribute resolution failures, particularly ensuring that if an attribute access results from a custom property or method, the error message reflects the actual missing attribute, not the custom property or method's name. To accomplish this without breaking existing functionality:\n\n- Catch AttributeError exceptions within custom methods or property accesses specifically.\n- Introduce checks to distinguish direct attribute access from accesses within custom defined properties or methods.\n- Modify the error message logic to more accurately reflect the source of the AttributeError, ensuring it targets the correct attribute that couldn't be found.\n\nImportantly, this enhancement should preserve all existing attribute access and resolution logic, including the resolution of attribute names that correspond to coordinate frame transformations, frame attributes, or other dynamic attributes managed by `SkyCoord`. The adjustment should only affect the accuracy of error messages to improve the developer experience and debugging process without altering the successful resolution and transformation capabilities currently provided by the `SkyCoord` class."
