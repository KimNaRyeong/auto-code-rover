        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, it would be beneficial to gather more context about the `SkyCoord` class, specifically its error handling for attribute access. Specifically, I aim to understand how the `__getattr__` method is implemented in the `SkyCoord` class or its superclass, since the reported problem appears to emanate from there. The reported misuse of attribute error messaging is likely due to custom logic within this method. Additionally, getting details about the `custom_coord` class's implementation context might help, although this is directly related to the customization shown in the issue description. \n\nGiven these considerations, the search actions could be as follows:\n\n1. Review the `__getattr__` method implementation within the `SkyCoord` class to understand how it is handling nonexistent attribute access.\n2. Search for the implementation context of `SkyCoord` to identify if the issue is known or if there's a direct manipulation of error messages that could explain the misleading behavior.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be pertinent:\n\n- `search_class(\"SkyCoord\")`: This would help in identifying the file where `SkyCoord` is implemented.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"SkyCoord\")`: To directly fetch the implementation details of the `__getattr__` method in `SkyCoord`.\n\nLet's execute:\n- `search_class(\"SkyCoord\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"SkyCoord\")`"
