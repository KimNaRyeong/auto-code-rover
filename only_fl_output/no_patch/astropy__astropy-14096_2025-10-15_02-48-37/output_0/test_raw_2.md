To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that aims to capture the reported issue about a subclass of `SkyCoord` giving a misleading attribute access message, we can structure the script to trigger the attribute error by attempting to access an undefined attribute as in your initial description. This script will intentionally try to access a non-existent attribute to reproduce the error situation. If the error message is not as expected (i.e., misleading as mentioned), it will print the stack trace using the provided function.

```python
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr

try:
    c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
    # Attempt to access the property that triggers the attribute error.
    c.prop
except AttributeError as e:
    # Check the exception message
    if str(e) == "'CustomCoord' object has no attribute 'prop'":
        print("The script raised the expected AttributeError, but the message is misleading")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising `AssertionError` to indicate the issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
    else:
        print("The AttributeError message has been corrected or is different")
        exit(0)
```

Please save this content into a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. When executed with Python 3 (`python3 reproducer.py`), this script should help in reproducing the issue.

- If the issue is present (i.e., misleading error message), it will print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError`.
- If the issue is not present (e.g., because `SkyCoord` has been fixed to raise a clearer error message), it will simply note that the message has been corrected or is different and exit with code 0.

Running this script in your environment should help verify the current state of this issue in the `SkyCoord` class of the `astropy` package.
