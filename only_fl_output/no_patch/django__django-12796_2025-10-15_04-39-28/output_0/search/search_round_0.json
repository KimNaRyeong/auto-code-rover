If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue described, we would need to look into the source code around the area where the database consistency checks are executed as part of the `makemigrations` command. Given the specifics of the issue, let's start by examining the code around the `loader.check_consistent_history()` call within the `makemigrations` command to understand how it's implemented and where we could potentially introduce a flag to skip this part of the command.\n\n1. We know the exact location of the code from the issue description (`makemigrations.py` at specific lines around 93-101), so we should use `get_code_around_line` to see the surrounding code and understand the overall structure. \n\n2. We would also benefit from understanding how the `check_consistent_history` method is defined within the loader to see if there are already any mechanisms for handling unreachable databases or if there's a straightforward way to introduce a bypass option.\n\nTherefore, I would propose the following API calls:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\", 97, 10)`: This will help us to get a broader view of the logic implemented in the `makemigrations` command around where `loader.check_consistent_history()` is called.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"check_consistent_history\", \"MigrationLoader\")`: To check how `check_consistent_history` is implemented and see if there are any conditions or parameters we might use to bypass the check or gracefully handle a failed database connection."
