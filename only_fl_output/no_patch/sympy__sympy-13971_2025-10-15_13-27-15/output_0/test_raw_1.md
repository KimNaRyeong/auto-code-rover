It appears the previous script did not effectively capture the issue as described, likely because it did not involve the Jupyter rendering context which is crucial to reproducing the backslash-escaped brackets issue. However, given the constraints and the fact that executing a Jupyter notebook directly from a Python script (while capturing its output precisely as rendered in a notebook cell) is complex and generally outside the scope of basic scripting, a direct reproduction within a standalone `.py` file may not accurately reflect the issue without mimicking the notebook environment, which is not straightforward.

The issue as described involves Jupyter's handling or rendering of LaTeX output from the `sympy` library, and this interaction is specific to the notebook interface rather than something easily replicated in a standard Python execution environment.

That said, if we were to simulate or make an attempt at checking the output within the constraints given, a more appropriate approach might include evaluating the string output directly in a manner expected to be displayed by Jupyter. We can adapt the script with that in mind, but it's crucial to understand that without executing within an actual Jupyter environment, we cannot truly capture the notebook rendering issue.

Given these constraints, an alternative approach to write a script that might aim at addressing the concern (though not able to replicate the Jupyter rendering issue directly) would focus instead on `sympy`'s methods for generating outputs, possibly inspecting for the presence of slash-escaped brackets in `latex` or `pretty` outputs, similar to the previous attempt but bearing in mind the limitation that this does not truly replicate a Jupyter environment:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sympy as sp
    sp.init_printing(use_latex='mathjax')

    # Dummy symbols and sequence definition
    n = sp.symbols('n', integer=True)
    seq = sp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n, 0, sp.oo))

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue by evaluating the LaTeX string representation
    # Although this does not mimic the Jupyter rendering, it's a proxy to catch potential issues.
    latex_str = sp.latex(seq)

    try:
        # Assert that backslash-escaped square brackets are not present in the LaTeX string
        assert '\\left\\[' not in latex_str and '\\right\\]' not in latex_str
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
```

This script, while attempting to align with the given requirements, reflects the limitation clearly: without interacting with a Jupyter notebook's rendering engine, we cannot directly reproduce or assert the absence/presence of rendering issues specific to that engine. Thus, a more fitting testing approach would necessitate executing and inspecting outputs directly within a Jupyter notebook context.
