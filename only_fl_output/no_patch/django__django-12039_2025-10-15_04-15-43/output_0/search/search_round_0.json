When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the issue description related to the Django project and the creation of the CREATE INDEX statement having incorrect spacing, we should gather more context about the affected parts of the Django's backend system, specifically the way Django generates SQL for index creation. The issue points directly to the handling of `col_suffixes` in the `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns` class and also mentions how indexes with `opclasses` are affected. Let's focus on gathering information on those areas:\n\n1. To understand how the `Index` class generates the faulty SQL, it's essential to look into the implementation of this class.\n2. Since the `Columns` class was explicitly mentioned along with a link pointing to a problematic line in `ddl_references.py`, examining this file further would be beneficial.\n\nHere are the API calls that can help retrieve the necessary context to address the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the Index class** to see how it's implemented and how it might be generating the CREATE INDEX statements.\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. **Search within `ddl_references.py` for the `Columns` class**, since the issue points to this file as part of the problem.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Columns\", \"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\")`\n\n3. **Get code around the problematic line** to understand how `col_suffixes` are handled, as the issue description suggests there's a problem with how empty strings within `col_suffixes` are leading to the spacing issue.\n   - Given that there's no exact line number provided and the URL to the file might reflect a state of the repository at a specific time, it's essential to look at the logic around the handling of `col_suffixes` rather than a specific line. However, since the direct line isn't provided, this step might require a generic look into the implementation details of how columns are referenced during index creation, so skipping the direct line lookup.\n\n4. Since `opclasses` are mentioned, it's also important to understand how they are processed during the SQL generation for CREATE INDEX statements.\n   - `search_code(\"opclasses\")`\n\nThese API calls should help gather the necessary code context around how Django generates SQL for index creation and how the spacing issue tied to descending order and `opclasses` usage without explicit ordering comes about."
