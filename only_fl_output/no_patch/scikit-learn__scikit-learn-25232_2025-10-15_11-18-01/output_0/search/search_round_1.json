From its [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html):\n> **initial_strategy {\u2018mean\u2019, \u2018median\u2019, \u2018most_frequent\u2019, \u2018constant\u2019}, default=\u2019mean\u2019**\n> Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the strategy parameter in SimpleImputer.\nI have set the initial strategy to `\"constant\"`. However, I want to define this constant myself. So, as I look at the parameters for `SimpleImputer` I find `fill_value`:\n>When strategy == \u201cconstant\u201d, fill_value is used to replace all occurrences of missing_values. If left to the default, fill_value will be 0 when imputing numerical data and \u201cmissing_value\u201d for strings or object data types.\nBased on this information, one would assume that `IterativeImputer` also has the parameter `fill_value`, but it does not.\n### Describe your proposed solution\nThe parameter `fill_value` needs to be added to `IterativeImputer` for when `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. If this parameter is added, please also allow `np.nan` as `fill_value`, for optimal compatibility with decision tree-based estimators.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided context from the `IterativeImputer` and `SimpleImputer` classes:\n\n### `IterativeImputer` Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `IterativeImputer` class is designed for multivariate imputation of missing values. It works iteratively, modeling each feature with missing values as a function of other features, in a round-robin fashion. The constructor accepts a variety of parameters that control the imputation process, including the `initial_strategy` parameter which determines how initial missing values are imputed before the iterative process begins.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue is that although the `IterativeImputer` allows specifying an `initial_strategy` for how initial missing values should be filled (e.g., with the mean, median, etc.), there's no way to set a custom fill value when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`. This is a functionality gap compared to the `SimpleImputer`, which does allow for a `fill_value` to be specified.\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior, as per the issue description, would be to enhance the `IterativeImputer`'s constructor to accept a `fill_value` parameter, similar to `SimpleImputer`. This parameter would only be used when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`, allowing users to specify the exact value used for initial imputation of missing values.\n\n### `SimpleImputer` Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `SimpleImputer` class provides basic strategies for imputing missing values, including mean, median, most frequent, and a constant value specified by `fill_value` when `strategy=\"constant\"`. The class is versatile and can be applied across a variety of datasets.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This part of the code serves as a model for what is requested in the issue for `IterativeImputer`. The `SimpleImputer`'s implementation of `fill_value` provides a direct reference for how a similar feature could be implemented in `IterativeImputer`.\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - For `IterativeImputer` to align with the intended behavior described in the issue, it would need to incorporate a `fill_value` parameter that functions identically to how it's implemented in `SimpleImputer`. When `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`, the specified `fill_value` should be used to replace all occurrences of missing values during the initial imputation phase.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve modifying the `IterativeImputer`'s constructor to accept a `fill_value` parameter and ensuring that this value is appropriately used during the initial imputation step when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`. This modification necessitates a close examination of both the `__init__` method and any other methods (e.g., `_initial_imputation`) that handle the initial imputation logic in the `IterativeImputer` class.\n\nThe relationship is clear: by drawing parallels to the `SimpleImputer`'s functionality, we can extend `IterativeImputer` to handle a `fill_value` parameter, thereby resolving the issue and enhancing the class's flexibility and usefulness for users needing more control over the imputation of missing values."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This parameter should be stored as an instance variable and used during the initial imputation phase when the `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. The existing functionality for other `initial_strategy` values should remain unchanged.\n\n   - **Location 2**: File: `sklearn/impute/_iterative.py`, Class: `IterativeImputer`, Method: `_initial_imputation`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Update the method to utilize the `fill_value` when the `initial_strategy` is `\"constant\"`. This means that if `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`, the method should impute missing values using the specified `fill_value`, allowing for a custom initial imputation value rather than relying on hardcoded defaults. This should work seamlessly with both numerical and categorical data, and should also accept `np.nan` as a possible `fill_value` for compatibility with decision tree-based estimators as mentioned in the issue. The method's logic should verify the compatibility of `fill_value` with the data type being imputed to prevent type errors.\n\nThese modifications will resolve the issue by applying the suggested `fill_value` functionality to the `IterativeImputer`, enhancing its utility and flexibility for users needing custom initialization of missing values."
