Write contents of snippet to module and set it to be explorable by sphinx.\n2. Install dependencies, in my `docs/requirements.txt`:\n```txt\nSphinx>=2.0.1\nsphinx-rtd-theme>=0.4.3\n```\n2. Build docs.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs are built and there is `foo` with valid type annotations.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/lycantropos/robust/tree/1c7b74e0cc39c1843a89583b8c245f08039a3978\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows 10, but also reproduces on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/shewchuk/builds/10817256/).\n- Python version: 3.8.0\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  `['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.viewcode']`\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to Sphinx's handling of empty tuple type annotations, we need to gather context about how Sphinx processes type annotations, specifically in `sphinx.domains.python`. The error trace refers to the `unparse` method within this module, where the `IndexError: pop from empty list` occurs. Given this information, we should search for the `unparse` method in the `python.py` file. Additionally, understanding how Sphinx uses type annotations throughout its codebase could provide more insight. Here are the specific API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"unparse\", \"sphinx/domains/python.py\")`\n2. `search_code(\"def foo() -> Tuple[()]\")`"
