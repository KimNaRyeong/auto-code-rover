This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` methods and the use of `MANAGERS` in the codebase provides insights into how Django handles emailing administrative and management users defined in settings. Let's break down the analysis based on the questions provided.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n**`mail_admins` Method:**\n- The `mail_admins` function is designed to send an email to the administrative users defined by the `ADMINS` setting in Django settings.\n- It constructs an email message using the `EmailMultiAlternatives` class, prefacing the subject with `settings.EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX`, and uses `settings.SERVER_EMAIL` as the sender. Recipients are derived from the `settings.ADMINS` setting, extracting the email addresses from the configured tuples.\n\n**`mail_managers` Method:**\n- Similar to `mail_admins`, `mail_managers` sends an email to the management users defined by the `MANAGERS` setting.\n- The construction of the email message is almost identical, differing only in the use of `settings.MANAGERS` for the recipient email addresses.\n\n**Use of `MANAGERS` Setting:**\n- The `MANAGERS` setting is referenced within the `mail_managers` function to obtain the email addresses of the management users. This setting is expected to be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and an email address.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue Kevin reported is directly related to how the `MANAGERS` setting is formatted and used in the `mail_managers` function. His project had `MANAGERS` set as a list of email addresses rather than the expected list of tuples containing names and email addresses. This misconfiguration led to runtime errors when executing the `mail_managers` function, as indicated by the `smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused` exception.\n\nKevin's experience suggests that validation of the `MANAGERS` and possibly `ADMINS` settings is missing or insufficient at the moment of their use within the `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions. This lack of early validation allows incorrect configurations to propagate through the system, leading to failures at runtime rather than during initialization or configuration checks.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, as suggested by the issue, would be for Django to validate the format of the `MANAGERS` (and potentially `ADMINS`) settings upon their use, raising a descriptive exception if the format does not meet the expected structure (i.e., a list of name-email tuples). This validation would serve as an early failure mechanism, preventing runtime errors and making misconfigurations easier to diagnose and correct.\n\nTo address the issue, we would consider adding a format check within the `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` methods (or at a point where `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS` are loaded or accessed) to ensure that each item in the `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS` settings is a tuple with two elements (name and email) and that the second element of each tuple is a properly formatted email address. If the validation fails, a clear and descriptive exception should be raised to inform the user of the incorrect configuration."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. Bug Locations:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: `django/core/mail/__init__.py`\n- Method: `mail_admins`\n- Intended Behavior: To resolve the issue, the `mail_admins` method should include a validation step to ensure each entry in `settings.ADMINS` conforms to the expected tuple format `(name, email)`, where `email` should also be validated for proper email formatting. If any entry does not meet this criterion, a descriptive exception should be raised. This change ensures that configuration errors are caught early, preserving the method's functionality to send emails to all listed administrators without encountering runtime errors due to format issues.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: `django/core/mail/__init__.py`\n- Method: `mail_managers`\n- Intended Behavior: Similarly, the `mail_managers` method should validate the `settings.MANAGERS` entries to make sure they adhere to the expected tuple format `(name, email)`, including a proper format check for emails. If the validation fails, a clear and descriptive exception should be thrown, articulating the expected format. This validation step will prevent runtime errors like `smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused` when the email system encounters improperly formatted recipient details due to configuration issues, thereby ensuring that emails are only attempted to be sent to properly configured managers.\n\nThese validations aim to fail fast if the configuration is incorrect, providing developers with immediate feedback about the misconfiguration, which aligns with the issue Kevin reported. This approach preserves the existing functionality of sending emails while introducing a robust check to avoid common misconfigurations."
