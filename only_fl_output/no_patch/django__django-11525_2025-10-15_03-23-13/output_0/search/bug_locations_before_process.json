        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `mail_admins` method should include a validation step to ensure each entry in `settings.ADMINS` conforms to the expected tuple format `(name, email)`, where `email` should also be validated for proper email formatting. If any entry does not meet this criterion, a descriptive exception should be raised. This change ensures that configuration errors are caught early, preserving the method's functionality to send emails to all listed administrators without encountering runtime errors due to format issues."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, the `mail_managers` method should validate the `settings.MANAGERS` entries to make sure they adhere to the expected tuple format `(name, email)`, including a proper format check for emails. If the validation fails, a clear and descriptive exception should be thrown, articulating the expected format. This validation step will prevent runtime errors like `smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused` when the email system encounters improperly formatted recipient details due to configuration issues, thereby ensuring that emails are only attempted to be sent to properly configured managers."
