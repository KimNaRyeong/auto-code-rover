This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

Based on the description of the bug, the following API calls will be necessary to understand the current implementation and to plan for changes that will allow early validation of email formats:\n\n1. **Search for `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` methods**: These are likely utility functions that Django provides for sending emails to admins and managers defined in settings. We need to understand their implementations to introduce validation.\n   - `search_method(\"mail_admins\")`\n   - `search_method(\"mail_managers\")`\n\n2. **Search for usage of `MANAGERS` setting**: Since the issue stems from an improperly formatted `MANAGERS` setting, we need to look at how this setting is fetched and used, which could be in the aforementioned functions or in the settings handling mechanism.\n   - `search_code(\"MANAGERS\")`\n\nThese calls will give us insight into where the `MANAGERS` setting is validated and used, and where we need to introduce exception raising for format validation."
