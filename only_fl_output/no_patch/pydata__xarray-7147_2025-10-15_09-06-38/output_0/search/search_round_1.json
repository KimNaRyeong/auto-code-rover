Search for the `decode_cf_datetime` and `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` methods, to see how time decoding is managed and where error handling could be improved.\n3. Since the error mention involves the inability to decode times with a non-standard calendar or times outside the 64-bit integer range, looking at the implementation of these methods could reveal where the variable's name can be included in the error message.\n\nGiven this, our API calls to gather sufficient context will be:\n\n- `search_class(\"CFDatetimeCoder\")`\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf_datetime\")`\n- `search_method(\"_decode_cf_datetime_dtype\")`"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### CFDatetimeCoder Class\nThe `CFDatetimeCoder` class is responsible for encoding and decoding variables with time values according to the Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions. It has methods for both encoding (`encode`) and decoding (`decode`) these variables, with optional parameters such as `use_cftime` which controls the decision-making on whether to use `cftime` objects for decoding.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** This class's `decode` method would be a probable location to introduce enhancements for this issue. Specifically, it could be modified to throw a more informative error message, including the variable's name causing the decoding problem.\n\n#### decode_cf_datetime Function\nThis function converts numeric dates in netCDF format into numpy date time objects or `cftime.datetime` objects, depending on the calendar used and whether it falls within specific date ranges. It tries to use pandas for decoding first, and if it encounters difficulties (unsupported calendar, out-of-bound dates), it falls back to using `cftime`.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** This function is central to the issue. It catches errors from pandas decoding attempts and falls back to cftime decoding but loses the context about which variable caused the issue. Enhancing error handling here to include the variable name could make debugging easier for users encountering issues.\n\n#### _decode_cf_datetime_dtype Function\nThis function seems to be designed for verifying that the first and last date in a dataset can be decoded successfully. It uses `decode_cf_datetime` internally for the actual decoding. If there's an exception during decoding, it throws a generic error message without specifics about which dates or variables caused the issue.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** Given that this function also interacts with `decode_cf_datetime`, and directly throws an error if unable to decode time units, enhancing the error message here to include specifics about the problematic variable would directly address the user's issue.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior to resolve the issue would be to modify the error messages generated within `decode_cf_datetime` and possibly `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` (or its callers) to include the name of the variable that caused the decoding issue. This would directly address the user's request for more informative error messages, making it easier to diagnose problems with datasets.\n\nConsidering the current analysis, the next step towards crafting a solution could involve looking at how variables and their names are passed around these functions and identify where this information can be captured and included in the error messages. Since `CFDatetimeCoder.decode` receives both the variable and its name, this method stands out as a starting point for adjusting how errors report the problematic variable's name."

This requires catching exceptions that might be thrown due to time decoding errors and re-throwing them with additional context, specifically mentioning the variable name that was passed to the `decode` method. Ensure that this enhancement does not disrupt the current functionality of decoding time variables.\n   \n   - **Location 2:** \n     - **File:** `xarray/coding/times.py`\n     - **Function:** `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype`\n     \n     **Intended Behavior:** Modify the exception handling inside `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` to better report errors related to time units decoding with details about the failing variable. Although this function does not directly receive the variable name, enhancing error reporting could involve adjusting the call stack to pass through or otherwise annotate exceptions with relevant identifying information about the variable.\n\nIn essence, the solution should aim to augment error reporting to aid users in identifying problematic variables without altering the core functionality of time decoding within the xarray library."
