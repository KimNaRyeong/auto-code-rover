However, this error message will not indicate the problematic variable's name.  It would be nice if it did, because it would make it easier for users to determine the source of the error.\ncc: @durack1\nxref: Unidata/cftime#295\n### Example\nThis is a minimal example of the issue.

        "content": "To resolve the issue, we need to understand how variables are decoded and how error messages are generated when decoding fails, especially in relation to time variables. The stack trace provided in the issue mentions several key points in the codebase:\n\n- The `CFDatetimeCoder` class is involved in decoding the variable.\n- The `decode_cf_datetime` and `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` functions handle decoding.\n- The `cftime.num2date` function is mentioned, which likely interacts with decoding, but modifying this is outside the scope of this project.\n- Error handling within these functions does not capture or include the problematic variable's name in the error message.\n\nWe would start by understanding how the decoding process is implemented for CF (Climate and Forecast) time variables and how errors are handled during this process. To get the necessary context, the following search API calls should be useful:\n\n1. Search for the `CFDatetimeCoder` class to understand its design and how it's used in decoding.\n2. Search for the `decode_cf_datetime` and `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` methods, to see how time decoding is managed and where error handling could be improved.\n3. Since the error mention involves the inability to decode times with a non-standard calendar or times outside the 64-bit integer range, looking at the implementation of these methods could reveal where the variable's name can be included in the error message.\n\nGiven this, our API calls to gather sufficient context will be:\n\n- `search_class(\"CFDatetimeCoder\")`\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf_datetime\")`\n- `search_method(\"_decode_cf_datetime_dtype\")`"
