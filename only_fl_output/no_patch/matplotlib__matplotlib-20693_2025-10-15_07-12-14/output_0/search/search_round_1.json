I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, it's important to understand how `selector` objects are structured within the MNE library, specifically within the context of Matplotlib from which the deprecation warning originates. Given the mentioned deprecation warning and the desire to find a proper migration path that does not rely on what seems to be a hack workaround, we need to investigate how `selector` objects, including their `rect` attribute and related properties, are being handled in the codebase. Therefore, I will focus on finding relevant classes, methods, and code snippets that could provide insights into proper usage and potential migration paths for deprecated functionality.\n\n1. **Search for the class or method related to `selector` objects:**\nSince the issue mentions that it's within MNE, which uses Matplotlib, and there's a reference to `selector.rect`, it's possible that `selector` is part of a specific class in Matplotlib dealing with interactive selection mechanisms. However, without knowing the exact class name, we can start by looking into methods or classes related to `set_color` and properties update patterns within selector functionalities.\n\n2. **Look for the deprecated functionality to understand its usage and then find its replacement:**\nThe issue describes the use of `selector.rect.set_color(color)` and updates to `rectprops` with `selector.rectprops.update(dict(facecolor=color))`, followed by a deprecation warning from a specific issue (`#20113`). Understanding how these methods were supposed to be migrated according to the deprecation warning would provide clues for a proper fix.\n\nGiven these points, I propose the following search API calls:\n- `search_method(\"set_color\")`: to find how the `set_color` method is used across the project, which might lead us to the class that implements `selector`.\n- `search_code(\"rectprops.update\")`: to find instances where `rectprops` is being updated, which may reveal the correct way to handle property updates post-deprecation.\n- `search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")`: to identify where in the codebase this exact deprecated functionality is being used, potentially revealing immediate usages that might also include comments or TODOs for migration plans.\n\nThese searches aim to uncover both the current usage of the deprecated features and the direction for migration suggested (if any) within the library's codebase."

        "content": "Analyzing the context from the search results:\n\n### `set_color` Method Occurrences\n\nThe search for methods named `set_color` revealed a variety of files where such methods are defined. Given the context of the issue, which involves changing the color of a selector's rectangle, these results suggest that the `set_color` method is a common utility used across different components like patches, lines, and collections in Matplotlib. This widespread use indicates that setting color is a fundamental operation, which is consistent with what the issue description implies\u2014changing the visual appearance of a selector component.\n\n#### Relevance to the Bug\nThe issue refers specifically to the inability to directly use `set_color` on a selector's rectangle without invoking a deprecation warning. Although the exact usage was not found in the codebase via the provided search terms, knowing where `set_color` methods are implemented can guide us towards the right class or component needing modification or replacement. The files mentioned (e.g., `patches.py`, `collections.py`) could hint at where to look for analogous or replacement mechanisms for setting colors on objects similar to `selector.rect`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nIdeally, based on the issue description, there should be a straightforward way to update visual properties (like color) of a selector's component (the rectangle, in this case) without directly manipulating properties slated for deprecation. This would mean either using an updated method or property mechanism that aligns with the latest best practices in Matplotlib's API.\n\n### Absence of Results for `rectprops.update` and `selector.rect.set_color`\n\nThe inability to find references to `rectprops.update` and `selector.rect.set_color` directly in the codebase could mean a few things:\n- The specific implementation details or usage patterns may have been refactored or removed, leading to the deprecation warning.\n- These operations might not be standard or recommended practices documented or exemplified directly in the codebase, pointing towards the need for an alternative approach.\n  \nGiven the absence of direct matches and the context of deprecation, it is likely that we need to explore alternative mechanisms provided by Matplotlib for updating these properties.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, we need to get more context about how selectors and rectangular objects are typically handled within Matplotlib. Searching for documentation or examples within the codebase that specifically mention selectors and their properties might be helpful. Additionally, inspecting the classes mentioned in the `set_color` search results could reveal a new, recommended approach to achieve the desired functionality.\n\n#### Possible API Calls\n1. Investigate classes related to rectangular shapes which could be linked to selectors. This might involve:\n   - `search_class(\"Rectangle\")`: Since the `selector.rect` implies a rectangular shape, understanding how rectangles are generally handled might provide clues.\n2. Explore any documentation or migration guides related to the deprecation:\n   - Given the specific issues mentioned (#20113), checking any documentation or migration guides within these discussions could offer direct guidance on how to adjust the code. Unfortunately, with the provided API calls, accessing external resources like GitHub issues directly isn't possible, suggesting the need to manually review these issues for guidance.\n\nThese steps aim to bridge the gap between the deprecation warning and the current best practices for managing colors and properties of graphical components within Matplotlib."

However, based on the analysis, the intended behavior of the code to resolve the issue involves:\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The code should provide a way to update the color of the selector's `rect` without directly accessing deprecated properties or methods. Given the deprecation warning discussed in the issue, the intended behavior would involve migrating to a newer API or method offered by Matplotlib that supports the updating of graphical properties (like color) in a way that is consistent with current best practices. This could involve:\n  - Identifying a new method or property mechanism in Matplotlib for changing the color of graphical objects.\n  - Implementing or utilizing a wrapper method within the project that abstracts away the direct manipulation of deprecated properties, instead using the current recommended approach from Matplotlib.\n\nWithout specific file names or classes from the search results directly related to the `selector` implementation, providing an exact bug location is speculative. It's clear, however, that the solution should accommodate the avoidance of deprecated API usage in favor of a more current and supported method for achieving similar functionality."
