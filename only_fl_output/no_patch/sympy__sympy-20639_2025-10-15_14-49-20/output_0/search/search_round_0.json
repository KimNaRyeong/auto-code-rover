Given the information from the issue, the following API calls can help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\"printing.pretty\")`: Since the issue mentions a bug in `printing.pretty`, searching for this keyword might locate the relevant module or file handling pretty printing.\n- `search_method(\"latex\")`: Understanding how the `latex` method works might provide insights into how expressions are handled for LaTeX rendering, which seems unaffected by the bug.\n- `search_method(\"str\")`: Exploring the `str` method could also shed some light on the string representation of expressions and why it deviates from the pretty print output.\n- `search_code(\"pi**(1/E)\")`: This will help in finding where and how the expression `pi**(1/E)` is being evaluated or formatted before printing."
