Here's a reevaluated standalone Python script to reproduce the issue. This script specifically targets the inaccurate rendering of `pi**(1/E)` mentioned, making sure to compare the printed output with the expected incorrect rendering `-1___╲╱ π `. 

Please note that due to the nature of textual comparison and differences between environments, you might need to adjust the expected incorrect output to match exactly what is being observed in your environment (e.g., the representation of the output depends on the version of the printing system used by sympy or the specific terminal encoding).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import pi, E, pretty

    # The expression with the issue
    expression = pi**(1/E)

    # Simulate rendering in the pretty print form (which showed the issue)
    rendered_str = pretty(expression)

    # The incorrect output that was observed 
    # NOTE: This might need to be adjusted based on the actual incorrect output being observed
    incorrect_output = "-1___\n╲╱ π "

    try:
        # Check if the pretty printed output matches the incorrect output
        assert rendered_str != incorrect_output, "Inaccurate rendering issue reproduced."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\n", rendered_str)
        raise SystemExit(1)    # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue
    else:
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
        raise SystemExit(0)    # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed or not present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script now specifically checks for the presence of the incorrect output as described and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to generate a clear stack trace if an `AssertionError` is caught, indicating that the issue was reproduced. Adjustments to the `incorrect_output` string should be made based on what is exactly observed when the issue is present.
