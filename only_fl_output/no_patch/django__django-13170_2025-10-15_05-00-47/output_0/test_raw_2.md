Given the specifics of your request and the need for monitoring execution outcomes to properly reflect issue reproduction and detection, here is how you could structure `reproducer.py`. This version includes a condition to assert the presence of the problem (the inability to use nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition) and exits cleanly if the issue is resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django setup for script to run
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    USE_TZ=True,
)
django.setup()

# Models definition
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Pizza(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name='pizzas', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Topping(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name='toppings', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Attempt to reproduce the issue
try:
    Restaurant.objects.annotate(
        pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
            'pizzas__toppings',
            condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
        ),
    )
    # The following line should not execute if the ValueError is correctly raised
    assert False, "Issue is fixed. FilteredRelation's condition supports nested relations."
except ValueError as e:
    if "doesn't support nested relations" in str(e):
        print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
    else:
        print_stacktrace(e)

except AssertionError as e:
    print(str(e))
    sys.exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(1)  # If the code reaches this point, it means the issue was successfully reproduced
```

This script should only exit with code 0 if the specific issue is fixed (meaning an `AssertionError` is raised indicating the lack of an error where one is expected due to the issue being fixed). In all other cases, indicating either the presence of the issue or an unexpected error, it will print an appropriate message or stack trace and exit with a code indicative of failure (non-zero), satisfying the conditions for testing and reflecting outcomes accurately according to the problem statement provided.
