        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **`FilteredRelation` Class Definition and `__init__` Method**:\n    - **What it does**: The `FilteredRelation` class is defined in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. Its `__init__` method takes a `relation_name` and a `condition`, which must be an instance of `Q()`. The method ensures that a valid `relation_name` is provided and that the condition is indeed a `Q` object. It initially sets `self.path` to an empty list, indicating a place where relation paths might be stored or processed.\n    - **Relationship to the bug**: The issue is directly related to this class and, more specifically, to how it handles the `condition` parameter. The fact that `self.path` is initially an empty list but does not seem to be elaborated on within the `__init__` method's context might be an area of interest for supporting nested relations. The validation in the `__init__` method does not currently consider the depth of the relation (i.e., it doesn't account for nested relations explicitly), which is at the core of the submitted issue.\n    - **Intended behavior**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the `FilteredRelation` to support conditions that involve nested relations, not just top-level relations. This indicates that there might need to be enhancements either in how `condition` is processed or in the logic that makes use of the `condition` downstream, particularly in constructing SQL queries (e.g., handling of joins for nested relations).\n\n2. **Search for Usage or Mention of `FilteredRelation`**:\n    - **What was found**: `FilteredRelation` is mentioned across multiple files such as `django/db/models/__init__.py`, `django/db/models/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. \n    - **Relationship to the bug**: These mentions likely correspond to how `FilteredRelation` is integrated into the ORM's querying mechanism, such as in the construction of QuerySets and their translation to SQL queries. The presence in these files suggests where the feature's implementation may need adjustments to accommodate nested relations.\n    - **Intended behavior**: The intended change or enhancement would allow for transparent handling of nested relation conditions within these areas, incorporating them into the ORM's logic in a way that extends the current capability to support deeper relation nesting.\n\n3. **Lack of Direct Mention of Limitation**:\n    - **What was found**: The search for the specific error message about nested relations not being supported yielded no results, suggesting that this limitation might be enforced indirectly, perhaps through the handling (or lack thereof) of nested lookups in related parts of the ORM.\n    - **Relationship to the bug**: This suggests that the limitation might not be explicitly coded as a clear exception or validation check (at least not using the searched string) but rather could be a side-effect of how nested relations are processed\u2014or not processed\u2014within query construction.\n    - **Intended behavior**: Ideally, parts of the code responsible for parsing and applying conditions in `FilteredRelation` objects should be capable of recognizing and correctly handling nested relation paths. The absence of a direct mention implies that the enhancement might involve adding new logic or modifying existing logic to explicitly support nested query conditions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step could involve a deeper dive into how conditions are used within the wider context of query construction and execution, perhaps focusing on `query.py` and `sql/query.py` files to understand the overall flow and where the current implementation may need extension or adjustment.\n\n**Further Context Needed**:\n- Examination of how the `condition` from `FilteredRelation` is utilized in query construction, particularly in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_file(\"build_filter\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")\n    search_code_in_file(\"FilteredRelation\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")\n    search_code_in_file(\"FilteredRelation\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")\n    ```\n\nThis would provide insight into whether the architecture is currently equipped to handle nested conditions and what might need to be adapted to support this feature."

This might involve modifying the `__init__` method or adding new methods to handle the complexity of nested queries. The validation logic should be updated to not only accept `Q` objects but also correctly interpret nested fields within those `Q` objects. The enhancement should ensure that nested conditions are transformed into the appropriate SQL JOIN operations, preserving the existing functionality for non-nested conditions.\n\n\n- **Location 2**: File: django/db/models/sql/query.py (and potentially other files involved in query construction)\n    - **Intended Behavior**: The methods responsible for constructing SQL queries from `FilteredRelation` objects, particularly those dealing with the `condition` attribute, should be adapted to support nested relations. This might involve the `build_filter` method or other related methods that compile `Q` objects into SQL. The code at this location should ensure that when a `FilteredRelation` includes a nested relation condition, the generated SQL correctly reflects the nested JOIN operations needed to implement such a query. This includes appropriately handling aliases for tables to avoid conflicts and ensuring that the conditions specified in the nested `Q` objects are applied correctly to the resulting SQL.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors aim to remove the current limitation while ensuring that existing functionalities for simpler, non-nested conditions remain unaffected."
