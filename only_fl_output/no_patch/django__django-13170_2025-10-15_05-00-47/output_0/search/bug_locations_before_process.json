This might involve modifying the `__init__` method or adding new methods to handle the complexity of nested queries. The validation logic should be updated to not only accept `Q` objects but also correctly interpret nested fields within those `Q` objects. The enhancement should ensure that nested conditions are transformed into the appropriate SQL JOIN operations, preserving the existing functionality for non-nested conditions."

        "intended_behavior": "The methods responsible for constructing SQL queries from `FilteredRelation` objects, particularly those dealing with the `condition` attribute, should be adapted to support nested relations. This might involve the `build_filter` method or other related methods that compile `Q` objects into SQL. The code at this location should ensure that when a `FilteredRelation` includes a nested relation condition, the generated SQL correctly reflects the nested JOIN operations needed to implement such a query. This includes appropriately handling aliases for tables to avoid conflicts and ensuring that the conditions specified in the nested `Q` objects are applied correctly to the resulting SQL."
