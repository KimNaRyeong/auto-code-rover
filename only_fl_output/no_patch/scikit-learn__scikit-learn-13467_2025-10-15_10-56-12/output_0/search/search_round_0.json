This way, we would understand how `mean_squared_error` is implemented and where to integrate the `squared` option, as well as identify the correct location to add the new scorer.\n\nHere are the API calls that I propose:\n\n1. Search for the `mean_squared_error` method across the entire codebase to understand its current implementation and identify the file it's located in.\n\n2. Search for any class that might be responsible for handling scoring, as the new scorer `neg_root_mean_squared_error` would likely be integrated there or follow a similar pattern.\n\n3. Based on the first two searches, further investigate specific files or classes for places where modifications or additions are needed.\n\nAPI calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"mean_squared_error\")`\n- `search_class(\"Scorer\")`"
