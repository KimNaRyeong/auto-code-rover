Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

Moreover, we'll look into how columns are addressed and managed, including the treatment of additional columns and reordering of columns. These searches are designed to provide insight into the current implementation and areas that might need adjustments based on the discussion points raised in the issue.\n\n1. Search for the `ColumnTransformer` class to get an overview of its structure and any related documentation within the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n   \n2. Search for the `transform` method within the `ColumnTransformer` class to understand its current logic, particularly how it handles additional columns and reordering.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n   \n3. To clarify the handling of the `n_features_in_` attribute within `ColumnTransformer`, it's important to see how it's defined and used.\n   - `search_code(\"n_features_in_\")`\n\nThis selection of API calls aims to cover the key areas highlighted in the issue: understanding how `ColumnTransformer` works internally, its approach to input validation and features management, and its flexibility concerning input columns during transformation operations."
