This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand how the `Requests` library processes URLs, particularly how it adds parameters to them and how it handles different URL schemes. The following specific pieces of information are crucial:\n\n1. How the `Requests` library processes URL before deciding which URLs to add parameters to.\n2. How the handling of unrecognized URL schemes was modified in the mentioned version.\n3. How `Session` objects currently handle URLs and whether there's any mechanism in place for URL preparation based on scheme.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls would provide the necessary context:\n\n- Search for the `Session` class to understand how sessions manage URLs.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Session\")\n```\n\n- Since the issue is about adding parameters to URLs and handling different schemes, searching for methods that build or modify URLs within `Session` might be necessary.\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"prepare_request\", \"Session\")\n```\n\n- The issue mentions a change in behavior due to patching. Searching for code snippets that deal with URL schemes could provide insight into how schemes are being handled or ignored.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"unrecognised schemes\")\n```\n\n- To understand how parameters are added to URLs and how schemes are validated, it would be helpful to find the method responsible for generating the final URL for a request.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"add_params_to_url\")\n```\n\n- Given the proposal to allow `Session` objects to have a registry for URL preparation based on scheme, it would be beneficial to search for any existing implementation of registries or scheme handling within the library to identify where the new functionality could be integrated.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"URL scheme registry\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to uncover how the Requests library currently processes and modifies URLs, particularly focusing on parameter addition and scheme handling. This information will form the basis for devising a solution to the issue described."
