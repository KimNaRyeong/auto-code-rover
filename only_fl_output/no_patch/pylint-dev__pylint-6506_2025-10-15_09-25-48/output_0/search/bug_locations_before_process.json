Instead of allowing the exception to propagate and cause a traceback, catch the exception within this method and print a user-friendly error message outlining the unrecognized options along with guidance on how to obtain a list of valid options (e.g., by using a help flag). Preserve the functionality that adds a message about the unrecognized option but enhances the final output provided to the user."

Upon catching this exception, a help message should be printed to the console, similar to the 'mypy' example given in the issue description. This might entail developing a new method or enhancing an existing one to display help information and list options in a user-friendly manner without displaying the traceback."
