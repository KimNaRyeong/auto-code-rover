Search for the class `PylintRun` mentioned in the traceback to understand its construction and initialization process.\n2. Search for the method `_config_initialization` in the file where it's defined, given its central role in option processing and the error generation.\n3. Search for the exception `_UnrecognizedOptionError` to understand how it's defined and potentially how it's being handled or could be handled better.\n4. Look into the file and around the lines where the exception is raised to get a better understanding of the control flow and how options are processed. The exact line isn't provided, but searching for the use of `_UnrecognizedOptionError` could approximate this need.\n\nLet's invoke the APIs as follows:\n\n- `search_class(\"PylintRun\")`\n- `search_method(\"_config_initialization\")`\n- `search_class(\"_UnrecognizedOptionError\")`\n- `search_code(\"raise _UnrecognizedOptionError(options=unrecognized_options)\")`"
