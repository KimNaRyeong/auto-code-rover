To create a Python script that reproduces the stated issue, the script needs to simulate a command line execution of `pylint` with an unrecognized option `-Q`. Considering the nature of the problem, which involves catching a specific exception raised by the `pylint` program when an invalid option is used, the script below attempts to capture this scenario.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_pylint_unrecognized_option():
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['pylint', '-Q'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        output = result.stdout + result.stderr
        if "unrecognized option found: Q" not in output or "Traceback" in output:
            raise AssertionError("Pylint did not handle the unrecognized option as expected.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Analyze stderr for the specific error message and lack of a traceback for a more accurate assertion
        stderr_output = e.stderr
        if "unrecognized option found: Q" not in stderr_output or "Traceback" not in stderr_output:
            print("The issue is present.")
            sys.exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
        else:
            print("Unexpected error.")
            sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_pylint_unrecognized_option()
```

This script executes `pylint` with the `-Q` option, expecting to see an "unrecognized option" error without a traceback. The function `print_stacktrace` is borrowed directly from your request to ensure that any caught exception's traceback is printed clearly and matches your requirements.

- When the issue is present (i.e., the undesirable traceback is shown), the script detects the condition and exits with a non-zero status, indicating failure.
- When the issue is fixed (i.e., pylint behaves as expected by showing a simple error message without a traceback), the script exits with a `0` status, indicating success.

Do note that direct manipulation of the `pylint` internals or mocking its behavior might offer a more precise catch of the specific `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception, but this script aims to reproduce the issue in a more general environment by simulating a real command-line execution scenario.
