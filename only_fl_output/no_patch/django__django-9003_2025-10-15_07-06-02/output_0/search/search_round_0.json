But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's start by gathering context around the relevant parts of the codebase. The bug report mentions a few key elements:\n1. `django.db.models.sql.Query.combine`\n2. The `Invoice` model\n3. Complex query usage in a view, which involves many-to-many self-joins, ORs, and the `combine()` method\n\nGiven this information, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search for the `combine` method within the Django model's SQL query handling to understand its implementation and locate where the assertion error might be happening. Since `combine` is part of the Django framework's internal `Query` mechanism, we aim to find its implementation or any overrides that might exist.\n   - `search_method(\"combine\")`\n\n2. Get more context about the `Invoice` model where the issue is observed. This can help identify if there's anything specific about this model that could contribute to the problem. Although the error is likely not in the model itself, understanding its structure could be helpful for reproducing and diagnosing the issue.\n   - `search_class(\"Invoice\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a complex query in a view using `combine`, understanding how these complex queries are formed and invoked could provide insight into the non-deterministic nature of the error. Unfortunately, without a specific method name or file, we cannot directly search for this view code. However, exploring the `combine` method's interactions might shed light on possible misuse or edge cases related to complex queries formation.\n    \nThe first two API calls will give us critical insight into both the potential source of the bug within Django's query mechanism and the structure of the involved model, which could be interacting with `combine` in a problematic way."
