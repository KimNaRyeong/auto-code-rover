</code><intended_behavior>The `combine` method should safely handle complex query combinations, especially those involving many-to-many self-joins and conditions such as ORs, without resulting in circular references within the `change_map`. The resolution should ensure that even when queries are combined in various orders or under different database states, `change_map` maintains a consistent and correct state. The assertion is designed to catch any inconsistencies early; therefore, the method's logic may need to be enhanced to prevent the creation of such states that lead to asserting failure. This enhancement could involve implementing a more robust mechanism for managing and verifying the integrity of changes made to queries as they are combined, ensuring no circular dependencies are introduced. The existing functionality of allowing queries to be combined to support complex data retrieval needs must be preserved while ensuring the process is error-free and deterministic.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>
