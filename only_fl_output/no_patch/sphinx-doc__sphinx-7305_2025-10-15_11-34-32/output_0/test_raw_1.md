Given the specific requirements, writing a standalone Python script that closely simulates the environment Sphinx operates in can be complex. To successfully reproduce the issue outlined, we'll need a strategy that not only initializes a minimal Sphinx environment but also checks for the error in parsing method signatures with default values involving expressions like `2**4`.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that the failure to reproduce the issue in the earlier attempt was due to a missing `docutils` installation, a dependency of Sphinx. For the script below, ensure that both `sphinx` and `docutils` are correctly installed in your environment. You can install these dependencies via pip:

```sh
pip install sphinx docutils
```

The revised `reproducer.py` script will:

1. Create a temporary Sphinx project programmatically.
2. Attempt to document methods using the specified syntax that triggers the issue.
3. Check for warnings or errors that match the reported issue.

Here is the revised script:

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_environment():
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx
    from sphinx.config import Config

    # Temporary directory setup
    srcdir = '_tmp_sphinx_src_'
    confdir = srcdir
    outdir = '_tmp_sphinx_build_'
    doctreedir = 'doctrees'
    os.makedirs(srcdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(doctreedir, exist_ok=True)

    # Minimal Sphinx configuration
    config = Config(None, {})

    # Create a minimal rst document with the specified method signatures
    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n')
        f.write('.. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n')

    return Sphinx(
        srcdir=srcdir,
        confdir=confdir,
        outdir=outdir,
        doctreedir=doctreedir,
        buildername='html',
        config=config
    )

def run():
    try:
        app = create_sphinx_environment()
        app.build(force_all=True)
        warnings = app._warning.getvalue()

        # This condition may need to be adjusted based on the actual output you are searching for.
        if "Unable to parse BinOp object" in warnings:
            print("Issue reproduced: 'Unable to parse BinOp object' warning detected.")
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate issue presence.
        else:
            print("No issue detected.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit with zero indicating no problems found.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero due to unexpected error.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

Please ensure all needed libraries are installed, and remember that the script exits with `0` if no issue is detected and `1` if it either reproduces the issue or encounters an unexpected error. Adjustments may be needed based on your precise environment or if the nature of the error changes (e.g., specific error messages).
