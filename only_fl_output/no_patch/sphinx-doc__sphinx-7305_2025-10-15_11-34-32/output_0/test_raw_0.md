To create a standalone Python script that reproduces the described issue, we'll simulate the environment in which Sphinx runs and attempts to document Python methods with specific signatures. The issue arises when Sphinx cannot parse argument lists containing expressions like `2**4`. The script needs to mimic Sphinx's behavior of parsing these arguments to detect whether the bug is still present.

We will create a reproducer script that integrates with Sphinx. Note that for this script to work, Sphinx (matching the versions mentioned in the issue) must be installed in the environment where the script is executed. Here's a possible approach for `reproducer.py`:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project():
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx
    import os

    # Setup minimal Sphinx config and directories for the test
    if not os.path.exists('test_project'):
        os.makedirs('test_project/_static')
        os.makedirs('test_project/_templates')
    with open('test_project/conf.py', 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("extensions = []\n")

    with open('test_project/index.rst', 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write(".. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n")
        index_file.write(".. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n")

    return Sphinx(
        srcdir='test_project',
        confdir='test_project',
        outdir='test_project/_build',
        doctreedir='test_project/_build/doctrees',
        buildername='html'
    )

def run_sphinx():
    try:
        app = create_sphinx_project()
        app.build(force_all=True)
        warnings = app._warning.getvalue()
        if "Unable to parse BinOp object" in warnings:
            raise AssertionError("Failed to parse arglist containing expressions.")
        else:
            print("No parsing issue detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sphinx()
```

This script follows these steps:
1. Defines a function to print a detailed stack trace for exceptions.
2. Creates a minimal Sphinx project with a configuration file and an `index.rst` that contains the problematic method signatures.
3. Initializes a Sphinx application configured to use the created project.
4. Runs the Sphinx build process and checks the warnings for the specific parsing error.

When executed, this script will:
- Print a detailed stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` if the error is present, indicating that Sphinx fails to parse the provided argument lists.
- Print "No parsing issue detected." and exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

To run this script successfully, ensure Sphinx is installed and corresponds to the versions mentioned (3.x, master at the time of the issue, where the issue is expected to occur, and ensure it does not exist on 2.x versions).
