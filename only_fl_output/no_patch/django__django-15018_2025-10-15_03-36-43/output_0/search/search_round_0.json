Specifically there are two sides to the failure:\nwhile I can provide an until value (as a string, which is processed by parse_time) there is no mechanism to pass a for value if that's how I want to spell the input\nthe for value is always required and attempts to parse the (string) until value passed, which then errors since the input formats are very different\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the command definition and usage within the project, especially how `call_command` interacts with these arguments. Here are the strategic API calls we can make:\n\n1. **Search for the BaseCommand class**: Since the issue is in a class that extends `BaseCommand`, we need to understand if there are any custom implementations or overrides that could affect how arguments are parsed or handled.\n   \n   ```\n   search_class(\"BaseCommand\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the Command definition**: To understand how `Command` is implemented beyond the snippet provided, particularly looking at initialization, argument handling or any custom logic that might interfere or need to be modified to resolve the issue.\n   \n   ```\n   search_class(\"Command\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for call_command usage**: Investigate how `call_command` is being used within the project, focusing on instances where `Command` or similar command classes are invoked. This can provide insight into how `call_command` is expected to handle arguments and if there are any workarounds or patterns we need to be aware of.\n   \n   ```\n   search_method(\"call_command\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the parser configuration**: Since the issue involves how arguments are added to the parser, we need to gather more context on how the argument parser (and possibly any custom actions like `parse_duration_to_time` and `parse_time`) are defined and used.\n   \n   ```\n   search_code(\"add_arguments\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_method(\"parse_duration_to_time\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_method(\"parse_time\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue and how they interact, laying the groundwork for developing a patch."
