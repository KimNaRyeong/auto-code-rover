        "content": "To address the mentioned issue, we'll need to understand how the constrained layout system calculates space for titles (both the figure's super title and the axes titles) and how wrapping is handled within that system. We would especially need to investigate how space is allocated for wrapped text since the issue specifies that explicit new lines don't exhibit the same problem.\n\nGiven that context, here are the API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the constrained layout to understand its mechanisms: `search_class(\"ConstrainedLayout\")`\n2. Search for the method that calculates or adjusts space for titles within the constrained layout system. This might not be straightforward to name without prior knowledge, so a generic approach to search could be necessary: `search_method(\"layout\")`\n3. Check how wrapping is handled for titles could be part of the `Figure` and `Axes` classes, as these would logically contain methods for setting titles. Therefore, we need to see how the `wrap` parameter is managed when setting titles: `search_method_in_class(\"set_title\", \"Axes\")` and `search_method_in_class(\"suptitle\", \"Figure\")`\n4. We also should look at any direct references to handling wrapped text in the context of space allocation. This would require searching for any specific functions or methods dealing with wrapping: `search_code(\"wrap=True\")`\n\nThese searches will help us gather enough context to understand where the adjustments may need to be made to accommodate long, wrapped titles in a constrained layout."
