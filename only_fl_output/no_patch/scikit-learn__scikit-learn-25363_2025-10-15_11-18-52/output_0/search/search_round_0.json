It makes sure that it will turn into an error if we forget to pass the config to `delayed`. The code will still be working if `joblib` decides to provide a way to provide a `context` and a `config`.\n</issue>"

Search for the `Parallel` function usage within the codebase to understand where and how it is being used in relation to the issue described.\n2. Search for the `delayed` function to understand its current implementation and usage within the project.\n3. Search for any code snippets that show configuration being passed to `Parallel` or `delayed` to understand the current mechanism of configuration passing.\n4. Search for any warnings being raised when the configuration is not explicitly passed, as described in the issue.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"Parallel\")\n- search_method(\"delayed\")\n- search_code(\"configuration\")\n- search_code(\"warning\")"
