        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `delayed` function to allow it to accept an optional `config` parameter explicitly. This configuration should then be passed down to the `_FuncWrapper` or utilized in a manner that ensures the captured function, when executed in parallel, adheres to the configuration specified at the point of the `delayed` call. This may involve extending `_FuncWrapper` or the mechanism by which `delayed` captures function arguments, to include and manage the explicit passing along of configuration settings. The existing functionality of capturing and deferring the execution of functions must be preserved, with the addition that it can now correctly use the provided configuration where necessary."
