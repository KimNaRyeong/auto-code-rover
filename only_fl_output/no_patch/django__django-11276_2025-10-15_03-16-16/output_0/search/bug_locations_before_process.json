        "intended_behavior": "The method `escape` should utilize Python's `html.escape()` to perform HTML entity escaping. This change aims to leverage the performance benefits and community support of the Python standard library's implementation. The method should continue to guarantee that the escaped output is safe for rendering in HTML contexts. The transition to `html.escape()` must consider the minor difference in escaping apostrophes, ensuring that it doesn't negatively affect Django's functionality or security posture. Output from `html.escape()` should still be wrapped with `mark_safe`, ensuring that Django templates recognize the output as safe to render without further escaping."

        "intended_behavior": "While `conditional_escape` is not itself buggy, modifications to the `escape` function necessitate a review of this method to ensure its continued correct operation. `conditional_escape` should seamlessly work with the revised `escape` method, effectively distinguishing and properly handling strings that are already marked safe. The behavior of smartly escaping or bypassing already safe strings must be preserved to maintain Django's security mechanisms against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks."
