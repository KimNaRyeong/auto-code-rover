The lack of a direct hit means we should look closer at files that deal with configuration or command-line interface (CLI) setup.\n\n2. **References to `--fixtures` found in multiple files**:\n   - The snippets found across various files, especially in `src/_pytest/python.py`, `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py`, and `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`, are likely central to how pytest manages and displays fixture information. These files are promising locations to look for the logic that handles the `--fixtures` option and possibly where we could implement the enhancement to display fixture scopes.\n   - **What does this part of the code do?** It appears related to handling, testing, and configuring fixture-related functionalities in pytest, including the processing and displaying of fixture information when `--fixtures` is used as a CLI argument.\n   - **Relationship with the bug?** These parts of the code directly interact with the handling of the `--fixtures` argument, making them prime candidates for where modifications are needed to include fixture scope information in the output.\n   - **Intended behavior?** Given the issue description, the code related to processing the `--fixtures` argument should be enhanced to not only fetch and display the names and docstrings of fixtures but also their scopes (e.g., function, class, module, package, or session level).\n\n3. **No results for `show_fixitures_per_plugin`**:\n   - The absence of a hit here indicates either a typo in the search query or that the method for displaying fixtures is named differently. \n\nTo further investigate and identify specific areas in the pytest code where changes can be made to address the issue, I will perform follow-up searches based on insights from analyzing the results:\n\n- Checking the files `src/_pytest/python.py`, `src/_pytest/helpconfig.py`, and `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` directly can reveal how fixtures are currently displayed and lead to where the scope information can be integrated.\n- Because the method `parse_arguments` was not found, looking into how `--fixtures` is processed in those key files might uncover the argument parsing logic or methods related to the `--fixtures` functionality.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next steps in API calls would be:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--fixtures\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--fixtures\", \"src/_pytest/helpconfig.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--fixtures\", \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at narrowing down the specific implementation details related to the handling of `--fixtures` within each file, pointing us directly to the logic which needs to be enhanced."

The existing functionality of listing fixture names and descriptions should be preserved while enhancing the output to show each fixture's scope (e.g., function, class, module, session) next to its name. This may involve adjusting how fixture information is retrieved and formatting the output to include scope data.\n\n- **Location 2: File: src/_pytest/helpconfig.py**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If this file contains logic for the `--fixtures` argument's help text or processing, ensuring that any enhancements or modifications made in `python.py` regarding fixture scope display are consistent and supported here. The help text might need updating to indicate that fixture scope information will also be displayed.\n\n- **Location 3: File: src/_pytest/fixtures.py**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This file likely defines and manages fixtures.
