Based on the requirements to reliably reproduce the issue as described, a corrected approach is necessary. Given the issue is that Matplotlib's `contour()` function is incorrectly autoscaling contour levels when they are completely outside the data range, the script below is designed to capture this specific behavior and verify it against what's expected â€“ that is, the provided contour levels should remain unchanged regardless of whether they fall within the data range.

The standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` attempts to accurately provide evidence of the issue. When executed, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, accompanied by a stack trace for clarity.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_contour_level_autoscaling():
    # Generating some data that is entirely within a known range
    x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = np.sin(X**2 + Y**2) * 40

    # Defining contour levels that are outside the range of the generated data
    contour_levels = [100]

    try:
        plt.figure()
        cp = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=contour_levels)
        plt.close('all')
        # The assertion fails if the levels are not exactly as specified
        assert list(cp.levels) == contour_levels, f"Expected levels {contour_levels} but got {list(cp.levels)}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_contour_level_autoscaling()
```

This script will:

1. Generate a dataset where the data range is known and controlled.
2. Attempt to generate contour plots using `contour_levels` that are deliberately set outside this range to trigger the issue.
3. Assert whether the resulting contour plot levels match the explicitly set levels. If they do not match due to Matplotlib's autoscaling behavior (adjusting levels based on the data range), the assertion will fail.
4. If an `AssertionError` is raised, it prints a stack trace before exiting with code 1, indicating that the issue is present. If no error is raised, the script exits quietly with code 0, suggesting the issue is resolved.
