        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

Based on the details provided, here is a plan for using the search APIs to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Class Lookup:** Since the method `_process_contour_level_args()` is mentioned, it's relevant to know which class it belongs to for better context. Although it's implied it might be part of a `Contour` class (given the context), it's not explicitly named. We should confirm its existence or find its actual class.\n\n2. **Method Lookup in Class:** After identifying the class, we should look up `_process_contour_level_args` within that class to understand its current implementation.\n\n3. **Code Snippet Search:** The issue describes a specific code block that evaluates contour levels against the data range. It's important to find where this logic is implemented to understand how it integrates with the rest of the function.\n\n4. **Kwarg Implementation Investigation:** Since the solution involves adding a new keyword argument (kwarg) to `contour()`, understanding its current parameters and how they're processed might require examining `contour()` itself.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the API calls I'm going to make:\n- `search_method(\"_process_contour_level_args\")` to identify which class or classes contain this method.\n- `search_method(\"contour\")` to get context on how contours are currently generated and where the new kwarg would fit into this process."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides implications on how to approach the reported issue:\n\n### Analysis of `_process_contour_level_args` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `_process_contour_level_args` method determines the contour levels and stores them within `self.levels`. It takes an optional list of levels specified by the user or determines the levels based on the data type and whether the contour plot is filled or not. Specifically:\n\n- **Lines 1124-1139:** Determine the `levels_arg` based on user input, data type, or default values. \n- **Lines 1141-1147:** Handle non-filled contours. It checks if the specified levels are within the data range (`self.zmin`, `self.zmax`). If no such levels are found, it sets `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]` and issues a warning that no contour levels were found within the data range.\n- **Lines 1149-1153:** Validate conditions for filled contours and increasing levels.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue is directly related to the behavior encapsulated in lines 1141-1147. When all requested contour levels fall outside the data range, the levels are overridden with `[self.zmin]`, which can be problematic as described in the issue.\n\n#### Intended behavior with respect to the issue\nThe intended behavior, as proposed, would be to integrate a flag that allows the user to bypass the automatic setting of levels to `[self.zmin]` when all specified levels fall outside the data range. In short, this flag would influence the behavior in lines 1141-1147, specifically preventing the override of user-specified levels.\n\n### Implications for the Proposed Solution\nGiven the issue description and proposed behavior, the solution involves modifying the `_process_contour_level_args` method within the `ContourSet` in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` to incorporate a new keyword argument that controls the conditional logic around the \"inside\" check and the setting of `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]`. The modification should allow the bypass if a new keyword argument (perhaps something like `override_autoscale_flag`) is set to `True`.\n\nTo proceed effectively, it'd be essential to:\n1. Identify how keyword arguments are passed from the `contour()` method to `_process_contour_level_args()`, which requires looking into the `contour()` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` considering it is likely the method that directly or indirectly calls `_process_contour_level_args()`.\n2. Design how the new keyword argument is added to the `contour()` method interface and ensure it is passed through to `_process_contour_level_args()` properly without disrupting existing functionalities.\n3. Consider the implications on the user interface and documentation, ensuring that the new functionality is clearly explained and does not introduce backward incompatible changes.\n\nTo move forward, it would be prudent to review the implementation of the `contour()` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` to understand how arguments and keyword arguments are processed and passed to `ContourSet` and its methods. This step is critical for designing a solution that integrates smoothly with the existing architecture and APIs of Matplotlib."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Location 1: \n   - File: `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`\n   - Class: `ContourSet`\n   - Method: `_process_contour_level_args`\n   - Intended Behavior: Modify this method to incorporate a new keyword argument that controls whether the method should override the provided contour levels with `[self.zmin]` when all specified levels fall outside the data range. This modification should ensure that when this override control argument is set to `True`, the automatic adjustment to `[self.zmin]` is bypassed, preserving the user-specified levels regardless of whether they fall within the data range. This change maintains the existing functionality by default and only alters the behavior when explicitly requested by the user, ensuring backward compatibility. Importantly, the addition of this argument needs to be carefully managed to integrate with the method's existing parameters and the broader architecture of argument passing in Matplotlib's contour plotting functionality.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to ensure that any documentation related to this method and the overarching `contour()` function is updated to reflect the introduction of the new keyword argument. This will help users understand the new feature and how to use it to control contour level autoscaling behavior."
