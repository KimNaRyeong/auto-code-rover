        "intended_behavior": "Modify this method to incorporate a new keyword argument that controls whether the method should override the provided contour levels with `[self.zmin]` when all specified levels fall outside the data range. This modification should ensure that when this override control argument is set to `True`, the automatic adjustment to `[self.zmin]` is bypassed, preserving the user-specified levels regardless of whether they fall within the data range. This change maintains the existing functionality by default and only alters the behavior when explicitly requested by the user, ensuring backward compatibility. Importantly, the addition of this argument needs to be carefully managed to integrate with the method's existing parameters and the broader architecture of argument passing in Matplotlib's contour plotting functionality. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that any documentation related to this method and the overarching `contour()` function is updated to reflect the introduction of the new keyword argument. This will help users understand the new feature and how to use it to control contour level autoscaling behavior."
