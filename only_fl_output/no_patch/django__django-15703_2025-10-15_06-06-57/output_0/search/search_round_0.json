        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we would first need to understand how `index_together` is currently implemented and used across the project. Since `index_together` is likely defined and used within models (Django or a similar ORM system), searching for its occurrences at both the class definition level (within `Meta` classes) and in any related database migration files or utilities that may reference or manipulate such indexes would be pertinent. Given the description of the provided APIs, here is a list of API calls we can start with:\n\n1. **Search for the `Meta` class usages within models**: Since `index_together` is defined inside the `Meta` class of Django models, we should start by searching for occurrences of `Meta` classes. However, given the API constraints, we will directly search for `index_together` within code to find relevant `Meta` class usages.\n   - `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\n2. **Search for explicit usages of `Index` class**: Since the goal is to transition from using `index_together` to using the `Index` class within `indexes`, finding current usages of `Index` will provide insight into how `indexes` are currently being declared. This will help in formulating a standard approach for converting `index_together` declarations.\n   - `search_code(\"Index\")`\n\n3. **Identify any utility functions or methods that alter or interact with `index_together`**: It's possible the project has utility functions or management commands that specifically deal with `index_together`, for instance, in automated migrations or schema alterations.\n   - `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\nThese searches are designed to gather a broad understanding of how `index_together` and `Index` are used within the project, enabling us to collect the necessary context to deprecate `index_together` in favor of `Index` within `Model.Meta.indexes`. This approach ensures that we have a comprehensive overview of the codebase's current state regarding index definitions, which is pivotal for executing a seamless transition."
