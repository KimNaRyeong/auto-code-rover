Given the situation where the initial test did not reproduce the issue and exited with code 0, let's refine our approach to ensure that it's more closely aligned with the scenario presented (including attempting to print the shear force function which may invoke LaTeX rendering in Jupyter Notebooks, potentially leading to the illustrated error).

Below is an updated `reproducer.py` which attempts to mock the environment or conditions under which the error could manifest, especially focusing on any LaTeX rendering that might be triggered:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy import symbols, init_printing
        from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics import Beam

        # Initialize pretty printing
        init_printing(use_latex='png')

        # Define symbols
        E, L, F, B, H = symbols("E L F B H")
        I = B * H**3 / 12  # Moment of Inertia
        
        # Beam setup
        b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
        b2.apply_load(-F, L / 2, -1)
        b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")
        R0, M0 = symbols("R_0 M_0")
        b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)
        
        # This command tries to show shear force visually, potentially causing the issue due to LaTeX parsing.
        s = b2.shear_force()
        
        # Trying to print or represent the shear force could trigger the exception
        from sympy.printing.latex import latex
        _ = latex(s)  # Explicitly using the latex function to simulate the rendering
        
        # If no exception is raised so far, assume the issue is resolved
        print("Issue fixed, no error occurred.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script tries a slightly different angle by explicitly invoking LaTeX-related functionality (`latex(s)`) to better simulate the condition under which the issue seems to have occurred, per your description. Remember, this script assumes an environment similar to what you have, and execution results might differ based on the exact setup or versions of libraries (`sympy`, `IPython`, dependencies for LaTeX rendering, etc.) installed.
