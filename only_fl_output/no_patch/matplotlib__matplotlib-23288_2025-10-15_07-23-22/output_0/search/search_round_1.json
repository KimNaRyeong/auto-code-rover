QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "From the API search results, we gather insights into several key areas of the Matplotlib codebase related to the issue at hand:\n\n### Analysis of `savefig` method results:\nThe `savefig` method is found in `figure.py`, `pyplot.py`, and notably, `backend_pdf.py` among others. This is critical because it indicates where the mechanism for saving figures as PDFs is located, with `backend_pdf.py` being of particular interest for our issue. This file likely contains the logic for rendering figures to PDF, including any annotations or URLs attached to text.\n\n### Relation to the issue:\nSince the problem lies in the PDF output where the URL-sensitive area is not rotated correctly with the text, focusing on `backend_pdf.py` could provide insights into how links are currently implemented in PDF exports. Understanding this implementation could help identify where to introduce the use of \"QuadPoints\" for rotating the clickable area alongside the text.\n\n### Analysis of `plt.text` and `url` code snippets:\nWhile `plt.text` usages across various examples and tutorials don't directly resolve the bug, they highlight the commonality and potential impact of fixing how URLs are associated with rotated text. The snippets containing `url` span multiple files, but `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py` stands out because it could relate directly to how URLs are managed in PDF exports.\n\n### Relation to the issue:\nThe examples and documentation using `plt.text` with URLs might be affecting user expectations on how clickable areas should work with rotated text. Understanding the implementation in `backend_pdf.py` concerning URLs could provide clues on adjusting or extending the functionality to handle rotation appropriately, ensuring the clickable area matches the visual orientation of the text.\n\n### Lack of direct results for `PDFPages` and `draw_text` in `PDFPages`:\nThe API did not return results for `PDFPages`, which suggests either a misunderstanding of the class's location/name or that the class handling PDF page rendering differs from the expected. The absence of information on `draw_text` in `PDFPages` prompts a need to refocus our search, perhaps towards more general text rendering methods in PDF backends or to explore classes responsible for assembling the PDF document.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering:\nGiven the absence of direct hits for `PDFPages` and specific text rendering in PDF context, the next logical steps include:\n1. **Investigate `backend_pdf.py`**: Specifically, to understand how text, especially with URLs, is treated and rendered into the PDF format. This might involve methods that process text objects or manage annotations.\n   \n2. **Search for text rendering in PDF backend**: Instead of directly looking for `PDFPages`, refine the search towards text rendering capabilities within the PDF backend, e.g., methods related to text anchoring, transformation, or annotation addition.\n   \n3. **Expand understanding of URL handling in PDFs**: Given the importance of correctly implementing \"QuadPoints\" for our issue, identifying where Rects or other bounding box representations are managed in the context of hyperlinks could pinpoint where enhancements are needed.\n\n#### Revised API Calls:\n- Explore `backend_pdf.py` for clues on text and URL management:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"draw_text\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")`\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"url\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")`\n\nThese revised searches are aimed at drilling down into how Matplotlib's PDF backend handles text rendering and URL annotations, directly addressing the reported bug's context."

Without direct access to the specific method names from the provided context, we focus on the generalized area for potential fixes.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The method responsible for rendering text with URLs in PDFs should account for the text's rotation by correctly implementing the \"QuadPoints\" in addition to the \"Rect\" for link annotations. This implementation should allow the clickable area to correctly rotate with the text, matching its visual orientation. This enhancement must maintain backward compatibility by also providing a \"Rect\" that encompasses the rotated text's footprint, ensuring that viewers not supporting \"QuadPoints\" still offer a functional (though potentially less precise) clickable area.\n   \n   The intended behavior involves:\n   - Calculating \"QuadPoints\" based on the text's rotation angle and position to precisely outline the clickable area that matches the rotated text.\n   - Ensuring that the original \"Rect\" represents a bounding box that comfortably encompasses the \"QuadPoints\" defined area, for compatibility with PDF viewers that do not support \"QuadPoints.\"\n   - Extending or adjusting the PDF backend's text rendering logic to include these calculations and metadata when embedding URLs in text objects.\n   \n   Preserving existing functionality means the text without URLs, or with URLs but no rotation, would remain unaffected by these changes. The URLs in non-rotated text should continue to use the straightforward \"Rect\" approach without \"QuadPoints\" for maximum compatibility."
