        "intended_behavior": "The method responsible for rendering text with URLs in PDFs should account for the text's rotation by correctly implementing the 'QuadPoints' in addition to the 'Rect' for link annotations. This implementation should allow the clickable area to correctly rotate with the text, matching its visual orientation. This enhancement must maintain backward compatibility by also providing a 'Rect' that encompasses the rotated text's footprint, ensuring that viewers not supporting 'QuadPoints' still offer a functional (though potentially less precise) clickable area."
