        "intended_behavior": "Parse `--fail-on` Option: Integrate the parsing of a new `--fail-on` command-line option. This involves augmenting the argument parser setup to recognize `--fail-on` followed by a list of issue types or codes. Evaluate Exit Code Based on `--fail-on`: Incorporate a new evaluation step that checks if any detected issues match the criteria specified by the `--fail-on` option and ensure it exits with a non-zero status if so. Preserve Existing Functionality: The new logic must respect and coexist with existing functionalities such as the `--fail-under` score threshold."
