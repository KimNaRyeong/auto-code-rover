Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. The script will attempt to import `benchmarking` from `sympy.utilities`, which is expected to raise an `ImportError` due to the missing module `__.test.item`. The custom `print_stacktrace` function is used to print a clear stack trace of the issue if the specific ImportError occurs. Otherwise, it will indicate whether an unexpected error happened.

This script works under the assumption that the described issue exists in the current environment setup (with `sympy` and `py` versions that manifest the issue). It will exit with code 0 only if the ImportError specifically mentions the missing `__.test.item` module, signifying the presence of the documented issue. If the import unexpectedly succeeds or fails for a different reason, the script will raise an AssertionError and print a non-zero exit code, indicating that the environment does not exhibit the expected failure mode.
