        "content": "To effectively collect code context for resolving the issue about autoreloading with `python -m custom_module runserver`, let's break down the issue description and create a plan to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. The issue involves autoreloading when starting a module using the `-m` option. This means we should look at how the autoreloader is implemented, particularly any logic that parses the module name (`foo.bar.baz`) and decides what to monitor for changes.\n\n2. The mention of `__main__.py` and handling dotted names (`foo.bar.baz`) suggests we're dealing with module and package loading logic, which might be handled specifically by the autoreloader's code.\n\n3. The reference to a specific commit (`\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/commit/ec6d2531c59466924b645f314ac33f54470d7ac3`) points us towards a previous fix that attempted to handle similar cases but apparently didn't cover all scenarios.\n\nGiven this analysis, our focus will be on:\n- The autoreloader's implementation and any specific methods within it that deal with module loading or argument parsing.\n- Any changes or relevant code from the mentioned commit.\n\nTo gather the initial context, we will execute the following API calls:\n\n- **search_code**: To find references to the autoreloading functionality and potentially the handling of `-m` option. This can give us entry points into the relevant code:\n  - `search_code(\"autoreloader\")`\n  - `search_code(\"__main__.py\")`\n\n- **search_code**: Since the issue specifically mentions the handling of dotted module names (`-m foo.bar.baz`), we can search for code snippets that parse module names or manipulate similar strings to find relevant code sections or methods:\n  - `search_code(\"-m\")`\n  - `search_code(\"foo.bar.baz\")` (Even though \"foo.bar.baz\" is likely an example, it might lead us to generic handling of module paths in code.)\n\nThese searches aim to identify files and methods within the Django project related to autoreloading and the module loading mechanism that could be involved in the issue, providing a starting point for further, more targeted queries."
