The autoreloader should correctly recognize and monitor changes in the specific module ('baz.py') for reloading. The handling of the module name parsing needs to be precise to allow for accurate reloading signals to be generated."

This involves accurately tracking the module for changes without assuming it is a package unless it truly is. Enhancing the path resolution and change detection process within this utility will directly impact the ability to autoreload modules started in this manner."
