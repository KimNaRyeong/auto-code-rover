To ensure the script accurately reproduces the issue and conforms to your requirements, letâ€™s construct a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the specific issue where the `Complement` function does not behave as expected when given a mixture of `Symbols` and numbers in its input. It will leverage the custom `print_stacktrace` function for error reporting as requested.

```python
from sympy import FiniteSet, Interval, Complement, Symbol
from sympy.abc import x, y

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_complement_mixed_input():
    a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
    b = Interval(-10, 10)
    result = Complement(a, b)
    # Based on the issue description, the result should be "{x, y} \\ [-10, 10]", 
    # which indicates that the numbers within the interval are properly removed,
    # but the symbolic entities (`x`, `y`) should remain since they are not numerically comparable.
    # This means the result should still contain `x` and `y`, since the subtraction of the interval [-10, 10]
    # would not directly apply to symbols.
    try:
        expected_result = FiniteSet(x, y)
        # The issue exists if the complement operation does not exclude the interval from the set containing both symbols and numbers as described.
        assert result == expected_result, "Complement operation did not produce the expected result."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_complement_mixed_input()
```

Please ensure that you have Sympy installed in your environment for the script to run successfully. The script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the observed behavior matches the problem description. When executed, it will either confirm the presence of the issue by exiting with code 1 and printing a relevant stack trace or acknowledge that the issue has been addressed by exiting with code 0 and printing a confirmation message.
