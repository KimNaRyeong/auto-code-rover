Based on the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding about the expected output for the test script. Let's adjust the reproducer script to accurately reflect the issue as presented. This time, we will ensure that the script checks for the specific issue related to Complement not working as expected with mixed inputs of Symbols and numbers, and the correct exception handling with `print_stacktrace` function.

```python
from sympy import Symbol, FiniteSet, Interval, Complement
from sympy.abc import x, y

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_complement_issue():
    a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
    b = Interval(-10, 10)
    try:
        # Calculating the complement
        result = Complement(a, b)
        # We expect {x, y, 2} \ [-10, 10] to properly subtract the interval from the set,
        # but since `2` is within the interval, and `x`, `y` cannot be evaluated numerically,
        # the expected result should indeed consider these symbols as not part of the numerical interval,
        # thereby retaining them in the result.
        
        # Incorrect behavior would improperly handle the mixture, resulting in an unexpected set.          
        # The expected output is to retain `x` and `y` as they are not numerically comparable to the
        # interval, so this assertion checks if the issue where the numerical comparison fails, exists.
        assert result == FiniteSet(x, y), "The issue with Complement not working with mixture of Symbols and numbers is present."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

try:
    test_complement_issue()
except AssertionError:
    # If an error is caught, it implies the issue exists.
    print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
    exit(1)
else:
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script aims to explicitly check whether the operation `Complement` between a set containing symbols and numbers and an interval behaves as expected, specifically when such a scenario should result in the symbols being retained in the output. The correct behavior is checked, and in the case of a mismatch, the provided `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` function is utilized to display detailed information regarding the error occurrence.
