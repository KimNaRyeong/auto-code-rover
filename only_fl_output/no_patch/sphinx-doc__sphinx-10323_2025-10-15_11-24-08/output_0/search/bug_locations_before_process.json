        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the `:prepend:` option within code directives, likely around functions processing the `literalinclude` and similar directives, should be augmented to preserve leading whitespace of the `prepend` content. This would entail ensuring that any application of `dedent` or similar transformations to the included content does not strip leading whitespace from the `prepend` string. The intended behavior should allow the `prepend` content to maintain its specified formatting, including indentation, when inserted before the included code segment. This preservation would enable users to match the indentation of the included content with the surrounding documentation correctly."

        "intended_behavior": "The logic for `:dedent:` option processing needs to be refined to ensure it does not apply to `prepend` or `append` content. The dedentation should strictly affect the content being included via the `literalinclude` directive and not the manually specified `prepend` or `append` strings. Implementing a conditional application of `dedent` or modifying how dedentation is calculated can achieve this. This ensures that users have control over the indentation of the content they are adding explicitly, separate from the automated adjustment of the included content's indentation level."
