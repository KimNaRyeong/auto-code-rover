        "intended_behavior": "In the `fit` method of the `Ridge` class, the data passed to the `fit` method (both `X` and `y`) should be checked for C-contiguity and possibly converted if necessary before being further processed or passed downstream where `ArrayData` or similar mechanisms expect C-contiguous arrays. This can be achieved by integrating a call to `check_array` with the appropriate arguments to enforce C-contiguity. This ensures that the existing functionality of fitting a Ridge regression model is preserved while preventing the `ValueError` caused by non-C-contiguous arrays being passed to functions or methods that require C-contiguity. The `check_array` function from `sklearn.utils.validation` should be leveraged for this purpose, as it already contains mechanisms for enforcing array checks and transformations based on specified criteria."
