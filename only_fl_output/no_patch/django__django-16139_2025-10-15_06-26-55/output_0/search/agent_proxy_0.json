Here are the API calls that would help gather this context:\n\n1. To find where the `UserChangeForm` class is defined:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"UserChangeForm\")\n```\n\n2. Since the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm` class is mentioned with a specific operation related to adjusting `password.help_text`, it would be useful to find where this method is being defined:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"UserChangeForm\")\n```\n\n3. The code snippet mentioned is related to formatting the link for password help text. To find similar occurrences or to understand how it's currently implemented across the project, the below API call can be used:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"password.help_text = password.help_text.format\")\n```\n\nThese calls should provide a good basis of context and help in understanding where and how to apply the suggested fix correctly."
