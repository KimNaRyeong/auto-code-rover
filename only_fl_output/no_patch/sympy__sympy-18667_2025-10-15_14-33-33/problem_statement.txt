Added new feature Schur_Number
<!-- I have added a new feature in the combinatorics module the Schur_number -->


The Schur number S(k) is the largest integer n for which the interval  [1,n] can be partitioned into k sum-free sets.  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchurNumber.html

I have also made the partition which can be proven by induction and I have added test cases
