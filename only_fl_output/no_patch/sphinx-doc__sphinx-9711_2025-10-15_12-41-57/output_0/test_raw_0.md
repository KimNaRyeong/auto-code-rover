Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py` which aims to replicate the issue described. This script simulates the version checking logic that may exist in the `needs_extensions` functionality and reproduces the string comparison bug for versions. The script raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, indicating the faulty version comparison logic, and exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., versions are compared correctly).

```python
def check_version(current_version: str, minimum_version: str) -> bool:
    """Checks if the current version is not less than the minimum required version."""
    return current_version >= minimum_version

def simulate_extension_version_check():
    minimum_required_version = "0.6"
    installed_version = "0.10"
    
    # This is where the issue is simulated: comparing versions as strings can lead to incorrect results.
    if check_version(installed_version, minimum_required_version):
        return True
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Installed version is incorrectly considered not new enough.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        assert simulate_extension_version_check(), "Version comparison logic is flawed."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    print("Version comparison logic is correct.")
```

This script, when run in the environment described in the issue, should exhibit the failure due to the improper version comparison (treating versions as strings rather than numerically comparing their parts). To fix the problem, a more robust version comparison mechanism must be employed, such as converting string representations of versions to `tuple` of integers and comparing these tuples instead.
