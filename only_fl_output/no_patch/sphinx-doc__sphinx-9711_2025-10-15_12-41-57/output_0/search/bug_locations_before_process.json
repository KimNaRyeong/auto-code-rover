This means parsing the version strings into numerical components and comparing them numerically to ensure that, for instance, version '0.10.0' is correctly recognized as greater than '0.6.0'. This can be achieved by utilizing a version parsing library that understands semantic versioning, or by implementing a custom comparator that accurately reflects the hierarchy of major.minor.patch components. The existing functionality for determining if an extension meets the required minimum version should be preserved, but enhanced to ensure accurate version comparison."

The intended behavior is to parse and compare version numbers correctly, recognizing the proper order of versions beyond simple string-based comparisons. For instance, facilitating or ensuring that any utilities or methods used for version constraints are capable of semantic version analysis."
