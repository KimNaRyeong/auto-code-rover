        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand the context in which the incorrect view name for Class-Based Views (CBVs) is generated on the technical 404 debug page. As the regression is mentioned to have occurred due to changes in a specific commit (0c0b87725bbcffca3bc3a7a2c649995695a5ae3b), we should first identify where and how the view name is determined and displayed in the debug pages. This involves looking into how the framework handles exceptions and generates debug information for 404 errors, particularly for CBVs.\n\nGiven the details, here's how we can structure our search:\n\n1. **Search for the CBV causing the issue**: Since the issue specifically mentions `view_tests.views.Http404View`, we can start by searching for this class to understand its implementation and any related exception handling.\n\n2. **Identify how the view name is captured and displayed**: We need to find where in the code the view name for the debug page is captured and formatted. This could involve looking into exception handling mechanisms or debug utilities that process and display error information in Django.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Http404View\")`: To find the definition of `Http404View` class.\n- `search_code(\"technical 404 debug page\")`: To find relevant code that handles the rendering or logic behind the technical 404 debug page, which might give us insights into where the view name is processed for display.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue's context and for further investigation."
