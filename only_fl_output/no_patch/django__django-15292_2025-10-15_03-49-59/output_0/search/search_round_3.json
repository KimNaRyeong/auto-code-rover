Specifically, the mention of files relating to debugging and exception handling such as `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` indicates these could be key areas where the issue's root cause lies. \n\n### Analyzing the `debug` Search Results:\n\n**What these parts of the code do:**\n- Files under `django/template/...` are likely involved in rendering templates, which might include the rendering of debug information. However, these are less likely to directly affect the issue.\n- `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` are of particular interest. The former is probably directly involved in generating the debug pages (including the technical 404 debug page), while the latter might handle exceptions at a level that includes determining what information gets displayed on such debug pages.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n- The bug involves an incorrect display of class names on a technical 404 debug page. Therefore, any code responsible for capturing, formatting, or displaying information about views on debug pages could be relevant. Specifically, this includes how the fully qualified class names are converted into a more human-readable format without the explicit class syntax (`<class '...'>`).\n- `django/views/debug.py` could contain logic that formats the class representation for display, which might have regressed or been altered in the mentioned commit.\n- `django/core/handlers/exception.py` might be where exceptions are caught and processed for debug output, including determining which view or class name gets displayed.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Ideally, both `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` should handle class names in such a way that they are displayed in a human-readable format without the class syntax on debug pages. This would entail properly handling or parsing the class object's string representation to extract just the class name and possibly its module path without the extraneous symbols.\n- Adjustments or fixes in these areas should respect existing functionality, ensuring that any change made to improve the class name display for CBVs does not negatively impact other debug information displays.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the potential relevance of `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, more detailed examination of these files is warranted. Specifically, looking at where the debug information is formatted and where exception information is processed and displayed could yield insights into where the regression was introduced.\n\nRequired API Calls for Further Context:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"debug\", \"django/views/debug.py\")`: To closely inspect how debug information is formatted and displayed.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"exception\", \"django/core/handlers/exception.py\")`: To understand how exceptions are handled and how view or class names are prepared for display on debug pages.\n\nThese steps aim to narrow down the exact location in the code where the reported issue may be addressed by correcting how class names of CBVs are formatted on the technical 404 debug page."

Since I have not conducted the additional searches mentioned above due to the constraints of our interaction model, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis based on common practices and the details available from the initial issue description and the search results provided:\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors\n\n**Location 1:**\n- **File:** `django/views/debug.py`\n- **Class and Method:** This needs more specific identification through further search, but it is likely to be in a method that formats the view or class names for display. Ideally, a method that takes the class reference and prepares it for presentation in the debug output.\n- **Intended Behavior:** The correction here should ensure that when the debug page displays the name of a class-based view that has caused a 404, it should show the simplified class name (e.g., `view_tests.views.Http404View`) instead of the Python representation of the class object (`<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`). This likely involves parsing the class object's representation to extract or simplify the name in a more readable format. The modification should preserve all other debug information formatting functionalities.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- **File:** `django/core/handlers/exception.py`\n- **Class and Method:** Similar to `django/views/debug.py`, this requires specific identification. Look for methods involved in handling exceptions raised during the request-response cycle, especially those that might catch view-related exceptions for rendering on debug pages.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that during the exception handling process, when the responsible view (especially CBVs) is identified, its class name is properly formatted without the explicit Python class syntax. The code change should ensure that any logging or debug information retains full detail but improves readability regarding the naming of class-based views involved in exceptions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe intention behind the specified behaviors for both locations is to make debug outputs more intuitive and readable by presenting class-based view names in a conventional format, without the clutter of Python's class object syntax. These changes should not alter the fundamental way exceptions are logged or debug information is presented beyond improving the accuracy and readability of class-based view names."

They are part of the process that formats and displays the information, including class names, on the debug page.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- The intended behavior would involve ensuring that class names are correctly formatted without the Python class wrapper syntax (`<class '...'>`). This suggests a potential need to adjust how class names or view names are being retrieved and displayed within these methods, possibly through more sophisticated extraction or formatting before inclusion in the debug information output.\n\n#### django/core/handlers/exception.py\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- This file deals with handling exceptions that occur at various points in the request-response cycle. \n    - `convert_exception_to_response` likely converts caught exceptions into HTTP responses that can be returned to the user.\n    - `response_for_exception` and `get_exception_response` likely determine the appropriate response to send based on the type of exception, including deciding when to show debug pages.\n    - `handle_uncaught_exception` would handle any exceptions that were not caught earlier in the process, potentially logging them or preparing them for display in a debug page.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n- The methods in this file are responsible for determining how exceptions, including 404s, are handled and displayed. If the 404 page is showing class names incorrectly, it could be due to how these exceptions are converted into responses or how the exception information is formatted for the response.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- To address the bug, the intended behavior here would be to ensure that when exceptions lead to a technical 404 debug page, the class names of CBVs involved are correctly and clearly formatted. This might involve adjusting the logic within these exception-handling methods to better process or format class names, particularly when assembling the information to be displayed on a debug page.\n\n### Summary\nThe detailed review of the methods in `django/views/debug.py` and `django/core/handlers/exception.py` provides a directional guide toward where the fix for the incorrect class name display might be implemented. A likely avenue for resolving the issue would include ensuring that both modules treat class names in a way that removes unnecessary syntax before they're rendered on the debug page, while maintaining the overall informational integrity of the debug output.\n"

This could be done by extending the logic used to render class names within these methods, applying a filter or transformation that checks if the name follows the class identifier syntax and, if so, extracts the class name using a regex or similar method before displaying it. This correction should apply only to the debug information formatting process, ensuring that the original error handling and information provided for debugging purposes remain intact.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- **File:** `django/core/handlers/exception.py`\n- **Method:** `convert_exception_to_response`\n- **Intended Behavior:** During the conversion of exceptions to HTTP responses, specifically for uncaught exceptions that result in the display of a debug page, add or refine the logic to format CBV names correctly. This could involve examining the exception or the view involved in the exception (if available) and adjusting the string representation of the view\u2019s name before it is passed along to the debug page rendering process. The goal is to ensure the class names are readable and informative, without altering the underlying exception handling mechanism beyond necessary formatting improvements.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe resolution of the issue hinges on adjusting how class names are represented in the debug information. This involves a careful balance: enhancing readability without compromising the detailed insight that debug information provides. Implementing these changes would directly address the reported issue, improving the developer experience by making debug output clearer and more actionable."
