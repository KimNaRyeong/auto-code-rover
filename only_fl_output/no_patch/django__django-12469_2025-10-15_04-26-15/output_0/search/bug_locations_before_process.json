        "intended_behavior": "Within the `get_queryset` method, adjustments should be made to respect the timezone of the user when filtering based on `date_hierarchy`. When constructing the date range filter, the start and end dates need to be localized to the user's timezone. This ensures the filtered results accurately reflect the dates relevant to the user's localized day, taking into account their timezone offset. Specifically, before applying filters generated from `date_hierarchy`, the code should ensure date boundaries are converted into the user's local timezone. This might involve integration with Django's timezone handling utilities to convert naive datetime objects to timezone-aware ones, specifically targeting the bounds used in `date_hierarchy` filtering."

        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the context for `date_hierarchy` within `changelist_view` may need to be revisited to ensure that the context's date hierarchy links are generated with awareness of the user's timezone. This might not involve changes within the `changelist_view` method itself but ensuring that any data passed to it, particularly variables related to date filters, are correctly timezone-aware. The goal is to maintain the functionality of generating hierarchical date filters (year, month, day) while ensuring the boundaries of these filters reflect the user's timezone. This would likely require collaboration with how the `ChangeList` class processes `date_hierarchy` to ensure consistent timezone application throughout."
