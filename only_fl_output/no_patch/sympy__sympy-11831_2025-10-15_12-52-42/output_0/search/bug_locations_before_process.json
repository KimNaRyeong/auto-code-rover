Specifically, when encountering an infinite set, the method should not attempt to reduce the set in a manner that requires determining its size but should rather work towards expressing the intersection result symbolically or apply logic that is appropriate for handling infinite sets."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_handle_finite_sets` method should be updated or a complementary method should be developed to gracefully handle intersections involving infinite sets such as `Naturals0`. This adjustment should ensure that the operation does not mistakenly proceed under the assumption that all involved sets are finite (and thus have a definable length). This could involve bypassing or specially handling those sets in the intersection logic that are recognized as infinite."
