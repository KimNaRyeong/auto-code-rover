Given the clarified task, the script below attempts to reproduce the specific issue of `drop_sel` on dimensions without coordinates in an xarray dataset. If the function attempts to drop indices without coordinates and fails, the script captures this behavior and prints the corresponding stack trace. If the issue described is indeed present, the script will exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to an unhandled exception. However, if the issue has been addressed in a future update of xarray where `drop_sel` somehow supports this operation directly or indirectly, the script will exit with code 0 indicating success.

Here's a revised version of the standalone Python file, `reproducer.py`, to specifically capture the behavior described:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
        ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})
        # Simulate dropping an index on a dimension without coordinate labels 
        # to reproduce the specific issue described.
        modified_ds = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])

        # If no error is raised and the operation is somehow successful,
        # print an informative message and exit with code 0.
        print("Operation completed successfully, which may indicate a change or fix in xarray's handling of `drop_sel` on dimensions without coordinates.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        # If an error is caught, it suggests the operation failed as expected (given the current understanding of the library's capabilities).
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Preserve the exit code 1 to indicate failure for analysis.
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script makes a direct attempt to execute the problematic operation and handles any exceptions by printing a detailed stack trace for diagnostic purposes. The comments and control flow have been crafted to align precisely with the scenario you've depicted, differentiating between expected failure due to current library limitations and unanticipated successful execution which would suggest a change in the library's behavior or a resolution of the described issue.
