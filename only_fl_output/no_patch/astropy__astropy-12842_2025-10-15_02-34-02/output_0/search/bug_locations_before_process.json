        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cols` method should be updated to handle `datetime64` datatypes more gracefully. This can be done by including `datetime64` within the set of allowed `ECSV_DATATYPES` or by implementing a specific check for `datetime64` that allows it with a warning for backward compatibility instead of raising a `ValueError`. The goal here is to preserve the ability to read older ECSV files that include `datetime64` datatypes, ensuring that Astropy remains backward compatible with its previous versions. The change would specifically mitigate the issue where reading an ECSV file with a `datetime64` column results in an error, thus aligning with the user's expectations based on previous Astropy versions."
