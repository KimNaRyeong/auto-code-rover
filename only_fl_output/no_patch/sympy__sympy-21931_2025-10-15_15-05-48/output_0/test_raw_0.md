Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue with the verbose printing of `Partition` (or similar combinatoric functions like `Permutation`) is present. When the issue is resolved (i.e., when the printing of `Partition` and similar functions is less verbose and more user-friendly, possibly using lists, tuples, or sets directly), the script should exit with code 0 without raising an error.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy.combinatorics.partitions import Partition
    from sympy import FiniteSet
    try:
        # Here we are using the examples provided in the issue description.
        # The issue is with how objects like Partition are printed.
        
        # Create Partition objects and convert them to strings for comparison
        partition_from_list = str(Partition([1, 2]))
        partition_from_set = str(Partition({1, 2}))
        
        # The expected behavior is for the Partition objects to print in a more
        # concise and user-friendly manner. Current behavior prints the inner FiniteSet,
        # which is considered verbose for this context.
        expected_from_list = "Partition([1, 2])"
        expected_from_set = "Partition({1, 2})"
        
        # If the issue is present, these assertions will fail, raising an AssertionError
        assert partition_from_list != "Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2))", "Verbose printing issue detected with list input."
        assert partition_from_set != "Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2))", "Verbose printing issue detected with set input."
        
        # If the printing format matches the expected format post-fix, no errors
        assert partition_from_list == expected_from_list, "Partition from list not printed as expected."
        assert partition_from_set == expected_from_set, "Partition from set not printed as expected."
        
        # If no AssertionError is raised, issue is considered fixed
        print("No issue detected. Printing format appears fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks for the verbose printing issue by comparing the string representation of `Partition` objects created from both a list and a set to an expected, less verbose format. If the current verbose `FiniteSet` printing issue is present, it will assert and the custom `print_stacktrace` function will provide the stack trace for the source of the assertion, indicating the issue is still present.
