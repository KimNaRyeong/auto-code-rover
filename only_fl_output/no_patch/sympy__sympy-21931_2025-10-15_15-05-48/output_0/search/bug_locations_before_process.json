        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new `__repr__` method within the `Partition` class. This new method should output a string representation of partition instances in a more concise and readable format without the verbose `FiniteSet` indication. The method should aim to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase and not interfere with the functionality provided by the `FiniteSet` class from which it inherits. A prospective implementation could check the type of the partition's elements and decide to print them using a list or set notation (e.g., `Partition([1,2])` or `Partition({1,2})`) based on the original input type or based on what is most intuitive for representing a partition."
