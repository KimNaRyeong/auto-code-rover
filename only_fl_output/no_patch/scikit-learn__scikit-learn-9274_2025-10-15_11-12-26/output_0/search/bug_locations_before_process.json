        "intended_behavior": "In the `_fit_lbfgs` method, the `max_iter` parameter should be explicitly passed to the L-BFGS solver as `maxiter`, ensuring the solver's iteration limit directly matches the user-specified `max_iter` setting in the `MLPRegressor` or `MLPClassifier`. This involves adjusting the method to correctly configure the L-BFGS optimizer call within scikit-learn, explicitly setting the `maxiter` option based on the model's `max_iter` attribute. This adjustment allows for greater flexibility and control by the user over the training process, ensuring that the maximum number of iterations reflects the parameter's intended usage. The change must maintain the existing functionality for other settings and solvers, focusing solely on correctly applying the `max_iter` parameter when the `lbfgs` solver is selected. This modification resolves the limitation where the number of iterations cannot exceed a default limit, allowing for extended training sessions as required for more complex models or datasets."
