        "content": "<issue>Training MLP using l-bfgs limited to default l-bfgs maxiter value\n#### Description\nTraining an MLP regressor (or classifier) using l-bfgs currently cannot run for more than (approx) 15000 iterations.\nThis artificial limit is caused by the call site to l-bfgs passing the MLP argument value \"max_iters\" to the argument for \"maxfun\" (maximum number of function calls), but not for \"maxiter\" (maximum number of iterations), so that no matter how large a number you pass as \"max_iters\" to train for MLP, the iterations are capped by the default value for maxiter (15000).\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nFit an MLP for a problem that requires > 15000 iterations\nHere is an example (tested in python 2.7):\nhttps://gist.github.com/daniel-perry/d9e356a03936673e58e0ce47d5fc70ef\n(you will need data.npy from the gist linked to above)\n````\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor\ntrain = np.load(\"data.npy\").tolist()\nmax_iter = 18000\nclf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)\nclf.fit(train[\"train_x\"],train[\"train_y\"])\nprint(\"score: \", clf.score(train[\"train_x\"],train[\"train_y\"]))\nprint(\"iters: \", clf.n_iter_, \" / \", max_iter)\n````\n#### Expected Results\nThe training should run for 18000 iterations.\n#### Actual Results\nThe training runs for 15000 iterations.\n#### Versions\nHere are my local version details, though the problem appears to exist on the current head, and so should exist for any python/sklearn versions.\n'Python', '2.7.12 (default, Jul  1 2016, 15:12:24) \\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]'\n'NumPy', '1.13.0'\n'SciPy', '0.19.1'\n'Scikit-Learn', '0.18'\n[WIP] FIX: use maxiter rather than maxfun in MultiLayerPerceptron with solver='lbfgs'\nIn my limited experience with LBFGS, the number of function calls is greater than the number of iterations.\nThe impact of this bug is that with solver='lbfgs' is probably not doing as many iterations as it should in master although I am not sure it matters that much in practice.\nTo get an idea how much funtion calls differ from iterations, I tweaked `examples/neural_networks/plot_mnist_filters.py` to be able to run for a few hundred iterations:\n```py\nmlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), max_iter=1000, alpha=1e-4,\nsolver='lbfgs', verbose=10, tol=1e-16, random_state=1,\nlearning_rate_init=.1)\n```\nThe result: 393 iterations and 414 function calls.\nNot sure whether we nest to test this, and how to test it, suggestions more than welcome!\n- [ ] add a whats_new entry once there is agreement\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the implementation of MLPRegressor and MLPClassifier, as well as how they fit data and how the `solver='lbfgs'` parameter is utilized within scikit-learn's neural network models. Let's address each piece of context with respect to the three questions posed:\n\n### 1. Implementation of MLPRegressor and MLPClassifier\nBoth classes, `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier`, inherit from `BaseMultilayerPerceptron` and are specified for regression and classification tasks, respectively. Their initialization parameters include `solver` amongst other hyperparameters, where `'lbfgs'` can be chosen as an optimizer.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe code defines the constructor `__init__` for both classes, allowing the user to specify various hyperparameters, including the solver to be used (`'adam'` by default), `max_iter`, `activation`, etc.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe issue seems to arise from how `max_iter` is being utilized within the training process when `solver='lbfgs'` is selected. Although `max_iter` is a parameter in both classes, the bug description implies that it does not directly control the iterations for the L-BFGS solver as expected.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior would be for the `max_iter` parameter to correctly control the maximum number of iterations when training with L-BFGS, allowing the training process to run for the specified number of iterations without being capped at a default maximum.\n\n### 2. The `fit` method in MLPClassifier\nWhile we could not retrieve the `fit` method for `MLPRegressor` through the API call, the `fit` method in `MLPClassifier` gives an idea of how fitting is generally structured in these classes.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `fit` method prepares and fits the model to the provided data and labels. It checks if the fitting is incremental and handles the parameters accordingly to train the model.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThis method delegates to an internal `_fit` method that likely manages the optimization process, including the setting and use of `max_iter` and potentially `maxfun`. The bug could be related to how `max_iter` is handled or passed through to the solver-specific optimization routines.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nIdeally, the `fit` method should ensure that when the L-BFGS solver is in use, the `max_iter` parameter effectively limits the iterations as per the user's specification, not a hardcoded or default value related to `maxfun`.\n\n### 3. Usage of `solver='lbfgs'`\nThe search for `solver='lbfgs'` led us to several examples and the logistic regression file. Although not directly related to MLP, it suggests where and how the `lbfgs` solver is employed within scikit-learn.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThese references demonstrate practical uses of the `lbfgs` solver in various contexts, including as a solver option in logistic regression and possibly in examples for neural networks.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nWhile not directly showing the bug, these references suggest that `lbfgs` is a commonly used solver option across different models in scikit-learn. The handling of `max_iter` in the context of `lbfgs` might follow a pattern or implementation detail that could be similar across these models.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe references should illustrate correct implementation practices for using `lbfgs`, including accurately handling `max_iter` and possibly `maxfun`. Understanding these implementations could help identify the discrepancy in the MLP's handling of the `lbfgs` solver settings, especially regarding `max_iter`.\n\n---\nGiven these analyses, further investigation is necessary to identify the exact implementation of the L-BFGS optimization in the MLP training process. Since the `fit` method in `MLPRegressor` was not retrieved, and the internals of how `max_iter` and potentially `maxfun` for `lbfgs` are managed are still not clear, additional API calls targeting the internal workings of the `_fit` method or how `lbfgs` solver settings are applied within the MLP context might be warranted. Specifically, looking into the `BaseMultilayerPerceptron` class, which both `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier` inherit from, could provide more insights."

The distinction between `maxiter` (maximum number of iterations) and `maxfun` (maximum number of function evaluations) must be clearly maintained and exposed to the L-BFGS solver according to user specifications.\n  \n  - This adjustment ensures that when a user specifies a `max_iter` value for MLP training with the L-BFGS solver, this value directly controls the iteration limit of the algorithm. Such a change would resolve the issue where training cannot exceed the default `maxiter` limit, irrespective of the `max_iter` value provided by the user.\n\n  - The existing functionality, including handling of other solvers (`adam`, `sgd`), should remain unaffected by this change. Only the mechanics of passing `max_iter` to the L-BFGS solver as `maxiter` need to be corrected or introduced.\n\n  - Additionally, this solution should preserve backward compatibility as much as possible, ensuring that any changes do not disrupt the expected behavior of existing code bases relying on the current `sklearn` neural network API."
