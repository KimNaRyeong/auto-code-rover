Below is the `reproducer.py` script crafted to reproduce the described issue. This script follows the steps you outlined, and it is compatible with Python 3, considering that Python 2 is now widely considered obsolete. Additionally, it uses a synthetic dataset generated inline instead of relying on an external `.npy` file to ensure it can be run independently without external data dependencies.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

    # Generate a simple random dataset
    np.random.seed(42)
    train_x = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    train_y = np.random.rand(100)

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)

    try:
        clf.fit(train_x, train_y)
        print("score: ", clf.score(train_x, train_y))
        print("iters: ", clf.n_iter_, " / ", max_iter)

        # Check if n_iter_ is less than max_iter, if so, raise AssertionError.
        assert clf.n_iter_ == max_iter, f"Expected {max_iter} iterations, got {clf.n_iter_}"
        print("Issue not detected, the expected number of iterations were completed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- The script generates a synthetic dataset using `NumPy` to be used with `MLPRegressor`.
- It sets `max_iter` to 18000 to reproduce the condition where L-BFGS should exceed the default iteration limit of 15000.
- After fitting the `MLPRegressor`, it asserts whether the number of iterations (`n_iter_`) matches `max_iter`. If not, it raises an `AssertionError`.
- If an exception occurs, it prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- If the training completes with the expected number of iterations, it indicates that the issue is resolved, and the script exits with code 0.
