Based on the provided instructions, here is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script that includes the corrected `print_stacktrace` function formatting, ensuring compatibility with Python 3 and aiming to reproduce the stated issue with the MLP regressor in a standalone file:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

    # Create a synthetic dataset
    np.random.seed(0)  # Ensure reproducibility
    X = np.random.rand(100, 20)  # 100 samples, 20 features
    y = np.dot(X, np.random.rand(20,))  # Generating target values

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(solver='lbfgs', max_iter=max_iter, verbose=True)
    
    try:
        clf.fit(X, y)
        print("Training completed.")
        print("Final iteration count: ", clf.n_iter_)
        assert clf.n_iter_ < max_iter, "Training exceeded the specified max_iter."
        print("Issue reproduced: Training is limited by the default max_iter value.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue fixed or not present: Training iterated as specified.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Usage and Output
- Place the `reproducer.py` file in the root directory of the project.
- Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script attempts to train an MLPRegressor with the L-BFGS solver for more iterations than the default limit. If the training stops before reaching the specified `max_iter`, it indicates that the issue is indeed present, and the script should print "Issue reproduced". If it successfully reaches or exceeds the specified `max_iter` without assertion errors, it will print "Issue fixed or not present", suggesting that the supposed limitation is not affecting the training process.

If any other exceptions occur during the setup, data generation, or the training process, the stack trace will be printed, providing insights into the failure point.
