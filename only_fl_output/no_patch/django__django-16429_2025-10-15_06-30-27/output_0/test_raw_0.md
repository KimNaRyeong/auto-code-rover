To reproduce the described issue, you can create the `reproducer.py` file with the following content:

```python
import datetime
from django.utils import timezone
from django.utils.timesince import timesince
from django.conf import settings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def set_up_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        USE_TZ=True,
        TIME_ZONE='UTC'
    )

def reproduce_issue():
    set_up_django_environment()
    now = timezone.now()
    past_date = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)
    try:
        result = timesince(past_date)
        assert "month" in result, "The result should mention 'month' if more than 30 days have passed."
        print(f"Test passed: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

Ensure you have Django installed in your Python environment (`pip install Django`), as this script relies on Django's utilities. It's also important to note that Django requires certain environment setups to run as expected, though for this simple script, configuring `USE_TZ` and `TIME_ZONE` within the script should be sufficient to reproduce the described behavior. Since this script aims to show an error when a datetime object with a one-month (or more) interval is passed to `timesince()` with `USE_TZ=True`, it will print a stack trace if the issue is present.

When executed in an environment where the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the evaluation condition fails or prints the stack trace of the TypeError. On a system where the issue is fixed, it should exit with code 0, indicating no error.
