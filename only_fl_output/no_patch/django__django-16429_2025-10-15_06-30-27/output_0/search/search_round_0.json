Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather more context about the implementation and usage of the `timesince` function, the `TestCase` class mentioned in the test example, and the handling of time zones within the project. Based on the information provided in the issue, several API calls are necessary to gather the appropriate context:\n\n1. **Search for the `timesince` function in the codebase**: Since `timesince` is directly mentioned with a potential fix, understanding its current implementation will help us. We want to find where `timesince` is defined and look at its implementation to understand how it handles datetime objects with and without time zones.\n\n2. **Get code around the mentioned line**: The issue pinpointed the problem to a specific segment of code in `django/utils/timesince.py` around lines 93 to 100. Viewing the code around this will provide context on how datetime objects are instantiated there and confirm the issue's description.\n\n3. **Search for the `TestCase` class in the codebase**: The test provided in the issue description uses a `TestCase` class with a specific test method. Understanding how `TestCase` is structured, especially the decorators `@requires_tz_support` and `@override_settings(USE_TZ=True)`, could provide insights into how time zones are tested.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following API calls are planned:\n\n- `search_method(\"timesince\")`: To find where the `timesince` function is defined and its implementation details.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/utils/timesince.py\", 96, 7)`: This will capture the context of the code around lines 93 to 100, providing details on how the problematic datetime object is created or manipulated.\n- `search_class(\"TestCase\")`: To get more context on the testing framework used in the issue's test case example, especially handling timezone settings in tests.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls."
