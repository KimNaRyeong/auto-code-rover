        "intended_behavior": "When creating the pivot `datetime` object in lines 93 to 100, the method should ensure that if the original datetime object `d` is timezone-aware, the pivot retains this timezone information. This involves adjusting the `datetime.datetime()` call to include `d`'s timezone (tzinfo) when creating the pivot. The modification ensures that when the `timesince` method calculates the difference between `now` (which may also be timezone-aware) and the pivot, both are either timezone-naive or timezone-aware, thus avoiding the `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. The change should preserve the method's ability to calculate the human-readable difference between two times, regardless of their timezone awareness, without altering the output for existing use cases where `d` is timezone-naive."
