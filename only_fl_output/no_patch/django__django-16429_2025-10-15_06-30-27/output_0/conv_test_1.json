Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n"

It's also important to note that Django requires certain environment setups to run as expected, though for this simple script, configuring `USE_TZ` and `TIME_ZONE` within the script should be sufficient to reproduce the described behavior. Since this script aims to show an error when a datetime object with a one-month (or more) interval is passed to `timesince()` with `USE_TZ=True`, it will print a stack trace if the issue is present.\n\nWhen executed in an environment where the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the evaluation condition fails or prints the stack trace of the TypeError. On a system where the issue is fixed, it should exit with code 0, indicating no error."
