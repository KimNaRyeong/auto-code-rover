Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n"

        "content": "Based on the request and considering the confusion in the execution output, I will correct the approach to ensure clarity. The reproducer will focus strictly on triggering the error when Django's `timesince` is used in an environment where `USE_TZ=True` and with datetime objects spanning more than 1 month in the past. Since the previously shared script seems to have reproduced the issue correctly, the emphasis here is to ensure that any misunderstanding is cleared up. This corrected version might closely resemble the initial one, with adjustments for clarity and a more direct approach to capturing the error.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport datetime\nfrom django.utils import timezone, timesince\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef set_up_django_environment():\n    settings.configure(\n        USE_TZ=True,\n        TIME_ZONE='UTC'\n    )\n\ndef reproduce_issue():\n    set_up_django_environment()\n    now = timezone.now()\n    # Generating a date 31 days in the past to ensure >1 month difference\n    past_date = now - datetime.timedelta(days=31)\n    try:\n        # Attempting to use `timesince` which should trigger TypeError if the issue exists\n        result = timesince.timesince(past_date)\n        # If no error occurred, check result is as expected or assert fail otherwise\n        assert \"month\" in result, \"The result should mention 'month' if more than 30 days have passed.\"\n        print(f\"Test passed: Expected output received -> {result}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        # If an exception is caught, print its stacktrace and re-raise it\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise e\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        reproduce_issue()\n    except AssertionError as ae:\n        print(f\"AssertionError: {ae}\")\n        # Indicates the check failed but the script ran correctly; exit normally\n        exit(0)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Indicates the actual presence of the issue\n        print(f\"Unexpected error indicating issue presence: {e}\")\n        # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure due to issue presence\n        exit(1)\n    # If no exception is raised, exit with 0 to indicate the issue is fixed\n    exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script sets up a minimal Django environment with `USE_TZ=True` and attempts to use `timesince.timesince(past_date)` where `past_date` is more than a month in the past. It specifically looks to reproduce the scenario where subtracting an offset-aware datetime (`now`) from `pivot` (implicitly offset-naive) raises a `TypeError`. \n\n- The script expects to catch and print this type error.\n- If the error is present, it prints the stack trace as described and exits with code 1.\n- If the assertion fails but no `TypeError` occurs, it means the functionality did not operate as expected, but no error related to timezone calculations was encountered; it prints the assertion error message and exits with code 0.\n- If the script runs successfully without errors or assertion failures, it indicates the issue might have been resolved; it exits with code 0."
