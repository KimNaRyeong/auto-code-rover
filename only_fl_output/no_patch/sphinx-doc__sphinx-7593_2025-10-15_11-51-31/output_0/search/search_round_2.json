Since the issue is about the `:kbd:` role conversion in Sphinx documentation, we need to find out how Sphinx currently handles this role. We specifically need to look at the class or method that handles role conversion or parsing in the Sphinx codebase. The issue doesn't specify a class or method name, so we have to start broadly.\n\n2. The conversion happens when Sphinx parses reStructuredText (reST) directives and converts them into HTML. So, we're likely looking for a method that deals with parsing reST or converting it to HTML.\n\n3. We also know that this involves the `<kbd>` element specifically in the context of handling reStructuredText roles to HTML elements conversion.\n\nGiven these points, we should initially search for methods and code that could be directly involved in parsing and converting reStructuredText (reST) roles to HTML, particularly focusing on `:kbd:` if such direct references exist in the code.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n- search_method(\"parse_restructuredtext\")\n- search_method(\"convert_to_html\")\n- search_code(\":kbd:\")"

Sphinx\u2019s mechanism for handling reStructuredText roles in a more generic way, which may not be specifically named after the output (HTML) or the input (reStructuredText) formats.\n2. Exploring the classes and methods responsible for role processing or directive handling, which might be where the logic for transforming `:kbd:` into `<kbd>` elements resides.\n3. Considering the Sphinx documentation system structure and how it usually represents these roles internally. Sphinx employs a modular architecture for processing documentation, which might involve specific modules or extensions for roles and directives.\n\nBased on these considerations, our next steps in API calls should involve:\n- Narrowing our search to Sphinx's roles and directives processing mechanism.\n- Since Sphinx is extended through extensions and utilizes a variety of modules for different tasks, we should look into any roles or directives handling modules or classes.\n\nTherefore, we should adjust our search criteria as follows:\n- search_class(\"Role\")\n- search_class(\"Directive\")\n- search_code(\"roles\")\n- search_code(\"directives\") \n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the Sphinx codebase that define or process roles and directives, which could lead us to the specific implementation that handles the `:kbd:` role."

These components are crucial in understanding how Sphinx processes reStructuredText, especially custom roles like `:kbd:`, and converts them into HTML elements.\n\n### Analysis of Results:\n\n1. **Roles and Directives Handling:**\n   - Files such as `sphinx/roles.py`, `sphinx/domains/__init__.py`, and `sphinx/directives/__init__.py` suggest there are centralized places where Sphinx defines or handles roles and directives. These would be prime locations to understand how custom roles are interpreted and transformed into HTML code.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue:**\n   - The issue pertains specifically to the handling of the `:kbd:` role and its conversion into HTML. Given the modular and extensible nature of Sphinx, the implementation that governs how roles are processed and rendered into HTML might reside in one of these identified files or modules.\n   - The role processing mechanism in Sphinx (potentially found within `sphinx/roles.py` or similar files) would directly relate to how `:kbd:` is currently being transformed into a single `<kbd>` HTML element, and would be the place to introduce the logic for splitting the role content into individual or nested `<kbd>` elements as suggested by the issue.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The code responsible for handling the `:kbd:` role should be modified or extended to parse the `:kbd:` content (e.g., \"Control-x Control-f\") and convert it into either individually wrapped `<kbd>` tags for each key sequence (preferred for accessibility and styling) or nested `<kbd>` elements to accurately represent combinations or sequences of keystrokes.\n   - This intended behavior would enhance the semantic meaning of the documentation and align with best practices in representing keyboard interactions in HTML, as stated in the issue description.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nTo resolve the issue, we would need to closely examine and modify the logic in files related to role processing, especially:\n- **sphinx/roles.py**: For custom role processing logic.\n- **sphinx/domains/__init__.py**: For domain-specific roles which might include keyboard shortcuts or similar constructs.\n- **sphinx/directives/__init__.py**: Although directives are slightly different from roles, understanding how Sphinx processes these might provide insight into how roles are handled as well.\n\nThe modifications would likely involve parsing the value provided to `:kbd:` to identify individual keys or key combinations and then wrapping those keys in separate `<kbd>` tags within the generated HTML. This enhancement would need to be done carefully to preserve backward compatibility and ensure that existing documentation using the `:kbd:` role is not adversely affected."

This parsing should account for different separators (like spaces or plus signs) and properly nest or sequentially place `<kbd>` elements as needed. The existing functionality for roles should be preserved, meaning this enhancement should only affect how `:kbd:` values are interpreted and converted into HTML.\n\n- **File:** sphinx/domains/__init__.py\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If any specific handling or customization for `:kbd:` or similar roles exists within domain-specific logic, ensure that these are compatible with or extended to support the new, more granular approach to generating `<kbd>` elements. Any domain-specific overrides or extensions that handle these roles should be reviewed to ensure they remain functional or are enhanced to support the intended nested or sequential `<kbd>` behavior.\n\nThese locations are identified as primary candidates for implementing the solution to the described issue, focusing on enhancing the semantic markup of keyboard shortcuts and key combinations in Sphinx-generated documentation."
