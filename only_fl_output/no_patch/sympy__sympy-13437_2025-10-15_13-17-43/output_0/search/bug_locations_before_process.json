        "intended_behavior": "This class should include a method to handle the limit operation specifically for Bell numbers. Considering the nature of Bell numbers and how their values grow, when taking the limit of Bell numbers as n approaches infinity, the result should be infinity (oo) instead of returning the unevaluated form bell(oo). This can be achieved by either implementing a specific ._eval_limit() method within the bell class that checks if the limit is towards infinity and directly returns oo, or modifying the eval method to handle an oo input more appropriately if deemed semantically correct within the broader architectural decisions of SymPy. This change would directly address the issue by ensuring bell(n).limit(n, oo) evaluates to oo, aligning with the natural growth behavior of Bell numbers and making the behavior consistent with other similar functions or numbers within SymPy."
