        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue where Sphinx is choosing `a.rst` over `a.md`, despite `a.md` being explicitly mentioned in the `index.rst`'s toctree, we need to analyze how Sphinx handles file selection and how the MyST (Markedly Structured Text) Parser plugin interacts with Sphinx. We should focus on how Sphinx determines which file to include when multiple files have the same name but different extensions, and how it can be influenced by the order of preference for file extensions or warning mechanisms.\n\nBased on the issue description, necessary context involves understanding the toctree processing, file selection priority, and possibly configuration options for file handling. Given the information, we can make the following API calls:\n\n1. To understand how Sphinx processes the toctree directive and selects files to include, we should look at the relevant code handling the toctree entries. Sphinx uses reStructuredText (reST) for its source files, and thus, parsing of `.. toctree::` is central to this issue:\n   - `search_code(\".. toctree::\")`\n\n2. The Sphinx extension mentioned, `myst-parser`, allows Sphinx to parse Markdown files (`.md`). It's necessary to see how this extension is integrated with Sphinx and how it affects file handling:\n   - `search_class(\"MySTParser\")`\n\n3. The bug suggests that Sphinx should have a mechanism to specify the order of preference for file extensions or, at the very least, issue a warning when there's potential ambiguity. To find related implementation, we need to search for configuration-related code that might deal with file extension preferences:\n   - `search_code(\"config\")`\n   - `search_code(\"file extension preference\")`\n\n4. Given the unexpected behavior occurs during the build process when Sphinx decides which file to include in the documentation, understanding how Sphinx or the `myst-parser` extension makes this decision could be crucial. We need to see if there's a method that directly deals with file selection or handling during the build process:\n   - `search_method(\"build_process\")`\n   - `search_method(\"select_file\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide the relevant code context and insights into how Sphinx and MyST Parser handle the situation described in the issue."
