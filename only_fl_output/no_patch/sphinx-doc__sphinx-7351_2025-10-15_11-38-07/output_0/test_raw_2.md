To address the issue where the `sphinx-build` command was not found due to environmental path issues (as seen from the error), we'll modify the reproducer script to build the Sphinx documentation using Sphinx's Python API directly. This approach eliminates the need for a subprocess call to `sphinx-build` and should work regardless of Sphinx installation specifics.

Please ensure that Sphinx and `myst-parser` are installed in your Python environment before running this script.

```python
import sys
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from io import StringIO

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_files():
    if not os.path.exists('test_project'):
        os.makedirs('test_project')
    with open("test_project/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(""".. toctree::
   a.md
""")
    with open("test_project/a.md", "w") as f:
        f.write("# Markdown file")
    with open("test_project/a.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(".. _a_rst:\n\nRST file")
    with open("test_project/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""extensions = ['myst_parser']""")

def run_sphinx():
    srcdir = os.path.abspath('test_project')
    confdir = srcdir
    outdir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'html')
    doctreedir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'doctrees')

    app = Sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, 'html')
    app.build(force_all=True)

    return app.statuscode

def check_issue():
    html_output_path = os.path.join('test_project', '_build', 'html', 'a.html')
    if not os.path.exists(html_output_path):
        raise AssertionError("Expected HTML file for 'a' was not generated")

    with open(html_output_path, "r", encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if "Markdown file" in content:
            # Issue fixed
            return True
        elif "RST file" in content:
            # Issue present
            raise AssertionError("Sphinx included the RST file over the MD file unexpectedly")

def main():
    setup_files()
    try:
        statuscode = run_sphinx()
        if statuscode != 0:
            print(f"Sphinx build failed with status code: {statuscode}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)
        check_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project directory with the necessary RST and Markdown files (`index.rst`, `a.md`, `a.rst`) and a basic `conf.py`.
2. Instantiates a Sphinx application in Python and builds the documentation using the Sphinx API directly.
3. Checks the output HTML file for the presence of "Markdown file" text to verify if `a.md` was correctly processed or if `a.rst` was processed instead, as described in the issue.
4. Uses the previously provided `print_stacktrace` function to print any exceptions encountered.

By using Sphinx's Python API, this approach avoids potential environmental issues related to the sphinx-build executable's location.
