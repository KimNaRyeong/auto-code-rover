Search for the method `digits` in the entire codebase to confirm its usage and see if there are other implementations or relevant functionalities that could be affected by this change:\n   - `search_method(\"digits\")`\n\n2. Get the code around the modification site to understand the current implementation and how the proposed arguments are integrated:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/ntheory/digits.py\", 37, 10)`\n\n3. Since the issue suggests modifying a file specifically (`sympy/ntheory/digits.py`), it would be helpful to know if there are related methods or classes within the same file that could intersect with the `digits` function modifications:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"class \", \"sympy/ntheory/digits.py\")`\n   - This search is aimed at discovering class definitions in the file, as they might be relevant for the context or integration of the modified `digits` function.\n\n4. Lastly, it's critical to ensure that the testing is thorough. Therefore, searching for existing tests related to the `digits` function could provide insight into how new tests might be structured or inspired:\n   - `search_code(\"test_digits\")`\n\nThese API calls are intended to supply a comprehensive understanding of where and how the `digits` function is utilized within the project, any dependent functionalities or integrations, and how testing is approached for this function."
