        "intended_behavior": "The `digits` function should be modified to accept an optional `bits` argument. This argument specifies the minimum number of digits the output list should contain. If the number of digits derived from `n` in base `b` is less than `bits`, the list should be padded with zeros after the base but before the first significant digit to ensure the total length matches the `bits` specification. This behavior preserves the original functionality when the `bits` argument is not provided, maintaining backward compatibility. When `bits` is provided, it enforces the output list to adhere to the specified length, thus extending the utility of the `digits` function for scenarios where a fixed-length numeric representation is needed. It's crucial to implement this functionality in a way that does not alter the interpretation of the numerals in their base representation. Padding should only occur between the base identifier and the sequence of digits representing the number in the specified base."
