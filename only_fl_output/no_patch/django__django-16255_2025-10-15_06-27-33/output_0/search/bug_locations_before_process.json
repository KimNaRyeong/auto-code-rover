        "intended_behavior": "The `get_latest_lastmod` method should handle the scenario where `self.items()` returns an empty sequence without raising a `ValueError`. This can be achieved by catching the `ValueError` in the same way `TypeError` is caught. If the `lastmod` attribute is callable and `self.items()` is empty (leading to an empty sequence passed to `max()`), the method should catch both `TypeError` and `ValueError`, returning `None` in such a case. This change ensures the method behaves gracefully, preserving its existing functionality while also handling the case of a sitemap without any items, thus resolving the issue described."
