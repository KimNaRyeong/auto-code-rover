Given the constraints presented in the scenario, the previous misunderstanding, and focusing on the requirement to raise an `AssertionError` upon encountering the described issue, the following Python script `reproducer.py` is created. This script assumes that the required packages (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) are already installed in the environment where it's executed. If the execution encounters a module not found error, it indicates that the required libraries are not installed, as seen in the previous attempt.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.objects as so

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
    subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
    tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

    p = (
        so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
        .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
    )

    p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

    ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
    ax.scatter([1], [1])

    fig.suptitle("Test title")

    # Check if the title is missing and raise an error if it is
    if not fig._suptitle:
        try:
            assert fig._suptitle is not None, "Figure title is missing."
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate an error/failure due to AssertionError
    else:
        print("Test passed: Figure title is visible.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to specifically address the issue described: checking if the figure title is present after plotting with seaborn's objects API on subfigures. According to the given specifications, it should raise an `AssertionError` (and print a stack trace) if the issue occurs, indicating the test failed because the expected figure title is missing. Conversely, if the figure title is correctly displayed (meaning the issue is resolved or does not manifest), it will print a success message without raising exceptions, reflecting a pass condition for the issue in question. 

Please ensure that `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are properly installed in your Python environment before running this script.
