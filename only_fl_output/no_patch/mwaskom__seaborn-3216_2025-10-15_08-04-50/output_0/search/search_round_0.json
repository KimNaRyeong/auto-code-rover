        "content": "<issue>Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls we'll proceed with:\n\n1. Identify where the `Subfigure` class is defined within the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"Subfigure\")`\n\n2. The issue mentions an incorrect line in the `_core/subplots.py` file, implying the file where the bug is present. Therefore, it's important to examine the code around the specified line to understand its context and interactions.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"_core/subplots.py\", 186, 10)`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive look at the current implementation surrounding `Subfigure` usage and the specific line modification suggestion, allowing us to understand why the figure title might be affected negatively by plotting on subfigures."
