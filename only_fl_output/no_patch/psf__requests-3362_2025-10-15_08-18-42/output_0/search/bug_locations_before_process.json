        "intended_behavior": "The `iter_content` method should correctly decode the content into Unicode (string in Python 3) when the `decode_unicode=True` parameter is used. This means ensuring that the chunks returned from `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` are consistently decoded strings, similar to how `r.text` provides the decoded content. This might require revisiting the implementation logic within the `iter_content` method, specifically how it handles `decode_unicode` and interacts with `stream_decode_response_unicode` (or similar mechanisms) to ensure the decoding process accurately reflects the parameter's intention. The existing functionality for handling binary content or not decoding must be preserved when `decode_unicode=False`."
