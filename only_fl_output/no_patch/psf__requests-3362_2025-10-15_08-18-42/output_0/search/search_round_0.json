My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to explore how the `requests` library handles the difference between `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` and accessing the response content directly via `r.text`. Since the issue revolves around the behavior of `iter_content` and potentially `r.text` and how they handle decoding, let\u2019s focus on gathering context around these methods and any related code that would affect their behavior. Given the inputs, here are the specific API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"iter_content\")` - This will help us understand how `iter_content` is implemented and how it handles the `decode_unicode` parameter.\n\n2. `search_code(\"decode_unicode=True\")` - With this, we look for specific instances where `decode_unicode=True` is being used, which might give insights into standard practices or specific handling within the codebase.\n\n3. `search_code(\"r.text\")` - This should give us context on how `r.text` is implemented or used within the project, especially how it handles encoding and decoding, to compare with `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)`.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point to understand the current behavior and potential discrepancies in handling unicode and bytes between `iter_content` and `r.text`. After analyzing the results, we can better deduce if the observed behavior is as intended or if it reflects a misunderstanding or a bug."
