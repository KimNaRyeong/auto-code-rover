        "intended_behavior": "The `__eq__` method in the `ApproxScalar` class should be updated to explicitly handle cases where the `actual` value is `None`. Before proceeding with any numerical comparisons or checks for non-numeric types, it should check if `actual` is `None` and return `False`. This ensures that the method aligns with the principle of generating clear, understandable error messages or results when a comparison involves `None` and a numeric type. This adjustment will prevent the method from attempting subtractive operations or other numeric comparisons that result in a `TypeError` when one of the operands is `None`. This change must be made while ensuring that the existing functionality for numerical and non-numeric comparisons remains unaffected."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Although the `ApproxBase` class might not directly contribute to the observed bug, a review and potential update could ensure that its subclasses uniformly handle `None` as an `actual` value in comparisons. Specifically, initializing or utility methods in `ApproxBase` that affect how comparisons are made could include guidelines or checks that prevent subclasses from conducting operations leading to `TypeError`. This would largely be a preventive measure to maintain consistency and reliability in how `approx` functions deal with non-numeric and special values like `None` across different contexts."
