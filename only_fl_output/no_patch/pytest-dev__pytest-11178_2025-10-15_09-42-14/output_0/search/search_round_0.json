        "content": "To address the issue with `pytest.approx` failing with `TypeError` when one of the assertion objects contains `None`, we'll need to gather more context about how pytest handles comparisons within approximations, especially when `None` is involved. Given the specifics of the issue, I will perform the following API searches:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the `approx` function to understand how it's structured and how it handles comparisons. This will help us identify where the `TypeError` originates from.\n   \n2. Since the error message points towards a subtraction operation involving a `float` and `NoneType`, it's useful to search for the code that performs this operation, potentially in the method that calculates the difference between the expected and actual values.\n\n3. Given the context of the issue, it seems the problem lies within the comparison logic of `approx`. Searching for the `__eq__` method or any relevant comparison method within the `approx` implementation might yield insights into the failure.\n\nBased on the above considerations, here are the API calls I will make:\n\n- `search_method(\"approx\")`: This will help us locate the `approx` function/method within the pytest codebase.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"approx\")`: Since the issue deals with an assertion comparison, searching for the equality comparison method within the context of `approx` might provide insights."
