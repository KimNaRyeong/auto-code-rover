It should be noted that `pytest` typically runs test functions discovered within modules, not usually via the direct execution of a script as a main program. Nevertheless, the script calls `pytest.main` directly with itself as an argument to trigger the test execution, allowing for the behavior described where it attempts to verify the proper functioning (or detection of a fault) of the `pytest.approx` method when dealing with `None` type comparisons.\n\nWhen executed, if the issue is present (i.e., the `TypeError` is thrown due to trying to compare a `float` against `None`), the script will catch the exception and print a detailed traceback thanks to the custom `print_stacktrace` function. If an `AssertionError` is raised instead, it means the test has failed as expected (which would indicate the issue is theoretically \"fixed\" since the failure mode has changed from a `TypeError` to an assertion failure), leading to a clean exit with code 0.\n\nIt's crucial to update this script as needed to adapt to any changes in dependencies or environment, and users should be mindful of the specific versions of Python and `pytest` being used, as behavior might change across versions."
