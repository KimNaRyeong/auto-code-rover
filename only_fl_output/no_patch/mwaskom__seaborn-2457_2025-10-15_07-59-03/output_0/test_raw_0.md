This Python script, named `reproducer.py`, is designed to reproduce the specified issue with seaborn's lineplot function ignoring `ci=None`. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, indicating that seaborn did not handle the arguments as expected. The provided `print_stacktrace` function will print a detailed stack trace when an exception is caught, ensuring that the error's context and origin are clear.
