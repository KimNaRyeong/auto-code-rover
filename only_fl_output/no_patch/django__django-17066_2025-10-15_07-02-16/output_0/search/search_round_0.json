However, migrations serializer doesn't have any special facilities for ensuring stable output for sets and this is what causes annoying diffs for us all the time.\nI suggest to add a trivial serializer specifically for unordered sequences which ensures stable output no matter the iteration order. Stability can be achieved by sorting elements in the set by their string representation. This only affects the writer output, and doesn't interfere with the rest of Django in any way, so this change only improves developer experience, but has no effect on the performance and/or reliability.\nI hope that even though it's apparently not a major problem for most users you would still accept the fix to ensure stable migration writer output for the rest of us.\n</issue>"

We'll focus on finding the serializer for the `unique_together` constraint and any relevant methods in the migration system dealing with model states or constraints normalization.\n\nGiven this, I propose the following API calls:\n1. search_method(\"serialize\")\n2. search_class(\"MigrationSerializer\")\n3. search_class(\"ModelState\")"
