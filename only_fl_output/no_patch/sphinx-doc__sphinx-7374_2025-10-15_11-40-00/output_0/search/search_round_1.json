        "content": "To resolve the issue related to the breaking change to Python domain IDs, we will need to focus on the implementation that introduced this change, likely related to the handling of Python function anchors in documentation generated by Sphinx. Since the issue mentions a specific change (`#7236`) that switched from underscores to dashes in fragment identifiers for Python functions, we should look into the parts of the code that might be responsible for generating these identifiers. This involves areas of the codebase dealing with documentation generation, specifically those that format or manipulate domain object references such as Python functions.\n\nFirst, we need to identify where the logic that formats these identifiers resides. Given the general nature of Sphinx and how it generates documentation for Python projects, the change is likely in a module or method that handles Python domain objects or the generation of anchor identifiers for Sphinx documentation.\n\nLet's start by searching for the code or method responsible for generating these fragment identifiers or handling Python function names within the Sphinx project:\n\n1. search_method(\"generate_anchor_name\")\n2. search_method(\"format_function_identifier\")\n3. search_code(\"fragment identifier\")\n4. search_code(\"anchor for Python functions\")\n\nThese searches are designed to find the relevant method or code snippet responsible for the change in behavior described in the issue. By looking for methods that might be involved in generating anchor names or formatting function identifiers, as well as generic searches for terms related to the issue, we aim to gather enough context about the code that needs to be patched."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context about the issue with Python domain IDs changing from underscores to dashes in Sphinx documentation, we have two significant snippets from `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py` that mention \"fragment identifiers.\"\n\n### Analyzing Results\n\n#### Search Result 1\n- **File Path:** `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py`\n- **Code Context:**\n  ```python\n  82 # Regular expression to match colons only in local fragment identifiers.\n  83 # If the URI contains a colon before the #,\n  84 # it is an external link that should not change.\n  85 REFURI_RE = re.compile(\"([^#:]*#)(.*)\")\n  ```\n- **Analysis:**\n  - **What does this part of the code do?**  \n    This snippet shows a regular expression that appears to differentiate between external links and local fragment identifiers within a URI. It's designed to capture URIs that might contain a fragment identifier (stuff after the `\"#\"` symbol) without affecting external links (which might also contain colons before the `\"#\"`).\n  \n  - **Relationship to the bug?**  \n    While this snippet deals with fragment identifiers, it's more focused on parsing or handling URIs rather than changing how fragment identifiers are generated or formatted. Thus, while related, it doesn't directly address the issue described.\n\n  - **Intended Behavior:**  \n    Its intention is clear in handling various kinds of URIs for documentation, particularly for ePub output, but it doesn't directly inform us about the generation or transformation of fragment identifiers from underscores to dashes.\n\n#### Search Result 2\n- **File Path/Class/Method:** `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py > EpubBuilder > write_doc`\n- **Code Context:**\n  ```python\n  356     def write_doc(self, docname: str, doctree: nodes.document) -> None:\n      ...\n  359         This method is overwritten in order to fix fragment identifiers\n  360         and to add visible external links.\n  361         ```\n- **Analysis:**\n  - **What does this part of the code do?**  \n    It mentions an overridden method that aims to \"fix fragment identifiers\" and add visible external links, presumably in the context of ePub documentation generation. This indicates that it involves some processing of document trees (`doctree`) to ensure that fragment identifiers conform to certain standards or fixes.\n  \n  - **Relationship to the bug?**  \n    Though this method is concerned with the handling or \"fixing\" of fragment identifiers, it's in the context of ePub formatting rather than the broader Sphinx documentation project. However, knowing that there's intent to fix or process fragment identifiers here suggests similar mechanisms might exist elsewhere in the project that are more directly related to the issue.\n  \n  - **Intended Behavior:**  \n    The correction or processing of fragment identifiers in the `write_doc` method is intended to ensure valid and consistent documentation output. For the bug in question, we're interested in how Sphinx has changed its handling of identifiers across different documentation outputs beyond just ePub.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven that the issue is specifically about Python domain objects and their identifiers in Sphinx-generated documentation, and the results we've obtained so far are only tangentially related, we need to narrow our search towards Python domain-specific handling or the Sphinx mechanisms for generating documentation URLs/anchors that include function names.\n\nTo get closer to the specific bug context, consider the following API calls that could provide more relevant insights:\n1. **Search within Python domain handling in Sphinx:**\n    - Search for Python-specific documentation handling classes or methods, potentially related to \"domains\" or \"objects\" within Sphinx.\n    - `search_class(\"PythonDomain\")` or similar terms that could lead us to where Python object identifiers are processed.\n2. **Direct handling of fragment identifiers in the broader Sphinx code:**\n    - Given the initial results are from `_epub_base.py`, it might help to search outside of this context or within a more generalized domain handling context, such as `search_method(\"fix_ids\")` or `search_code(\"fix fragment identifiers\")` in areas beyond ePub handling, looking for Python-specific handling."
