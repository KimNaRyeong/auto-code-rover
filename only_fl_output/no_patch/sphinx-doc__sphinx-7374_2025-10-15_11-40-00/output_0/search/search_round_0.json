        "content": "To resolve the issue related to the breaking change to Python domain IDs, we will need to focus on the implementation that introduced this change, likely related to the handling of Python function anchors in documentation generated by Sphinx. Since the issue mentions a specific change (`#7236`) that switched from underscores to dashes in fragment identifiers for Python functions, we should look into the parts of the code that might be responsible for generating these identifiers. This involves areas of the codebase dealing with documentation generation, specifically those that format or manipulate domain object references such as Python functions.\n\nFirst, we need to identify where the logic that formats these identifiers resides. Given the general nature of Sphinx and how it generates documentation for Python projects, the change is likely in a module or method that handles Python domain objects or the generation of anchor identifiers for Sphinx documentation.\n\nLet's start by searching for the code or method responsible for generating these fragment identifiers or handling Python function names within the Sphinx project:\n\n1. search_method(\"generate_anchor_name\")\n2. search_method(\"format_function_identifier\")\n3. search_code(\"fragment identifier\")\n4. search_code(\"anchor for Python functions\")\n\nThese searches are designed to find the relevant method or code snippet responsible for the change in behavior described in the issue. By looking for methods that might be involved in generating anchor names or formatting function identifiers, as well as generic searches for terms related to the issue, we aim to gather enough context about the code that needs to be patched."
