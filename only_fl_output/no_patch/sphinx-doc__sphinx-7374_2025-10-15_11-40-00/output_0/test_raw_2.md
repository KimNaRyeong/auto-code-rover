Understanding the requirements precisely, here's a refined approach to `reproducer.py` that accommodates your scenario more accurately. Given the complexity of the issue – which involves generating documentation through Sphinx and checking for the presence of adjusted fragment identifiers – the script will focus on creating a minimal Sphinx project, triggering a documentation build, and then verifying if the fragment identifier has indeed changed from underscores to dashes. This is a direct attempt to capture the issue as stated, without external dependencies like `nbsphinx`.

Please note, for this script to work, `sphinx` must be correctly installed in your environment. The error you received indicates `sphinx-build` was not found, suggesting Sphinx might not be installed in the current environment, or there's a PATH issue. Ensure Sphinx is installed via `pip install sphinx` or adjust the environment accordingly.

This script attempts to encapsulate the entire process: setting up a minimal Sphinx project, building the documentation, and checking for the shift from underscores to dashes in Python domain IDs within the generated HTML. Ensure that Sphinx is installed and accessible in your environment before running this script. If the script exits with a message about successfully reproducing the issue, it means the described behavior (the use of dashes instead of underscores) is present. If the script fails, it will attempt to provide meaningful output to debug the situation.
