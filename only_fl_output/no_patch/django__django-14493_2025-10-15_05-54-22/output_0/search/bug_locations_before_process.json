        "intended_behavior": "Within the `post_process` method of the `HashedFilesMixin`, the code must ensure that the handling of the `substitutions` variable (or any other variables that could lead to an `UnboundLocalError` if referenced before assignment) is robust against scenarios where `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0. This scenario was not originally accounted for, leading to the described issue.\n- Specifically, the method should initialize variables at the beginning of the method to cater to conditions where loops or conditional blocks might not be entered due to the `max_post_process_passes` being 0. This ensures that even if no post-processing passes are done, the method exits gracefully without throwing an error.\n- The initialization of `substitutions` (and potentially other critical variables) should happen in such a way as to preserve existing functionalities. This means ensuring that any logic that relies on these variables still functions as intended when `max_post_process_passes` > 0, while also handling the case when it's 0.\n- This approach maintains the intended functionality across all use cases, fixing the bug without adversely affecting users who do not set `max_post_process_passes` to 0."
