        "content": "To address the issue efficiently, we'll need to investigate how `pytest` triggers the deprecation warnings for hook implementations that are not using the new style, and also how it could be enhanced to include location information. Given the description, it's important to locate the mechanism that emits this warning, likely related to the handling of `pytest_configure` hooks or the mechanism checking hook implementation styles.\n\nFirstly, identifying where `pytest_configure` hooks are processed or registered, and how deprecation warnings are issued for old-style configurations, will be crucial. Additionally, understanding the system used for emitting warnings could help in figuring out how location information can be added.\n\nI will proceed with the following API calls to gather relevant information:\n\n1. To locate where `pytest_configure` hooks are processed:\n   - `search_method(\"pytest_configure\")`\n   \n2. To find the mechanism that issues deprecation warnings for hook implementations:\n   - `search_code(\"PytestDeprecationWarning: The hookimpl\")`\n\n3. As the issue also involves understanding how hooks are recognized and decorated, retrieving the part of the codebase where hook implementations are inspected can provide insights:\n   - `search_code(\"hookimpl\")`\n\nThese searches should help in identifying where modifications are needed to include location information in deprecation warnings."
