        "content": "Analyzing the collected context helps us understand the potential root and impact of the reported issue. Let's delve into each piece of information:\n\n### 1. `raises` Method from `src/_pytest/python_api.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis section of code defines the `raises` method, which is a central part of `pytest` used to assert that a block of code raises a specified exception. It allows for specifying the expected exception, and optionally, a `match` parameter to assert that the exception message matches a text or regex pattern.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe reported issue involves using `pytest.raises` with a Unicode match argument under Python 2, resulting in a `UnicodeEncodeError`. The `raises` method is where `pytest` implements the logic related to catching exceptions and matching exception messages against patterns. Specifically, the handling of the `match` parameter would be critical in understanding why a `UnicodeEncodeError` occurs since the error points to an encoding issue when dealing with Unicode text in assertions.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, the `raises` method should gracefully handle Unicode match patterns without throwing a `UnicodeEncodeError`, allowing assertions on Unicode exception messages to proceed without issue. This is important for supporting tests that involve Unicode strings, which is a common scenario.\n\n### 2. Absence of `assert False, u` in the Codebase\n\n#### Implications\nThe search for `assert False, u` didn't yield any results, indicating that direct assertions with Unicode messages using this specific pattern might not be prevalent or captured in the tests scanned. This could mean that the issue might not be a common occurrence in the tested scenarios or that Unicode handling needs to be tested more thoroughly.\n\n### 3. Instances of `UnicodeEncodeError` in the Codebase\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nOccurrences of `UnicodeEncodeError` throughout the codebase indicate points where Unicode encoding issues are explicitly recognized or handled. These might be areas where the project anticipates or addresses encoding problems, potentially including workarounds or fixes for Unicode-related issues.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nGiven the bug involves a `UnicodeEncodeError`, these snippets could provide insight into how the project handles similar issues. Understanding these could lead to clues about missing or inadequate handling of Unicode in the context of the `raises` method or related functionality.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIn contexts where `UnicodeEncodeError` is addressed, the aim would usually be to ensure that Unicode data is correctly encoded or decoded, preventing errors. For the issue at hand, the intended behavior would similarly be to handle Unicode match patterns without encoding issues.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo better understand how `pytest` handles Unicode strings for the `match` parameter and why it leads to a `UnicodeEncodeError`, we could:\n\n- Examine closer the implementation details around the `match` parameter processing within `raises` to see how Unicode strings are handled.\n- Look into the specific snippets where `UnicodeEncodeError` is mentioned to understand existing mechanisms for handling Unicode and encoding issues. This could provide hints or existing patterns that might be applied or extended to fix the reported bug.\n\nThese analyses should help form a basis for a patch or workaround to handle Unicode match patterns in `pytest.raises` assertions under Python 2."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This involves ensuring that both the exception message and the match pattern are properly handled as Unicode strings before attempting pattern matching. \n\nOne approach could be to explicitly convert or ensure that the exception message and the `match` parameter are Unicode (if not already) before performing the regex search. This might involve using the `unicode` function or the `u` string prefix for literals and handling the `match` parameter in a way that avoids implicit decoding or encoding that could trigger `UnicodeEncodeError`.\n\nThe existing functionality of matching exception messages to patterns for assertions should be preserved, ensuring that this change does not affect the behavior of the `raises` method under other conditions (i.e., when not dealing with Unicode or when running under Python 3).\n\nThis solution ensures that tests involving Unicode in exception messages can be written and executed without issue under Python 2, thus extending `pytest`'s Unicode handling capabilities to match its overall robustness and utility as a testing framework."
