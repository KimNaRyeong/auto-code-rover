Immediately invoke a testing-like scenario where an `AssertionError` is expected with a specific Unicode message.\n2. Capture and evaluate the `AssertionError` to determine if it matches the expected outcome directly.\n3. If an unexpected error or specifically a `UnicodeEncodeError` is caught during the process, it prints out the stack trace to directly visualize the error handling path, simulating the behavior described in the original issue without the direct reliance on `pytest`.\n\nBy executing this script within Python 3 (`python3 reproducer.py`), it should exit with code `0`, demonstrating that under Python 3, handling Unicode in exceptions (such as an `AssertionError`) should generally not encounter the `UnicodeEncodeError` that would occur under Python 2 when trying to match or print Unicode characters outside the ASCII range. This makes the script a direct methodology to validate the resolution or presence of the issue as described, under the specified or assumed conditions."
