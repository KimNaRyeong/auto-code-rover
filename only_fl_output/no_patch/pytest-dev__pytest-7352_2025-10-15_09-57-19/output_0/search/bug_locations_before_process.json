        "intended_behavior": "This method should not only manage the creation and cleanup of numbered directories robustly but also ensure that concurrent pytest processes do not interfere with each other\u2019s lock files or directories. To address the bug: - The method might need to implement a more reliable mechanism for generating unique directories that reduces or eliminates the chance of conflict between parallel test runs. - The process of creating, checking, and deleting lock files should be made atomic where possible, to prevent a situation where a process tries to access a lock file that has been deleted by another process. - Incorporate additional safeguards to gracefully handle the case where a lock file or directory expected to be present has been removed, potentially by another concurrent process. The existing functionality of managing temporary directories for pytest should remain intact, ensuring that old directories are cleaned up while not breaking when run in parallel or under heavy concurrency."
