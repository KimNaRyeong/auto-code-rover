Given that `sinc(x)` can be expressed as `sin(x)/x` for `x != 0`, and `1` for `x = 0`, the method should incorporate logic similar to handling `Piecewise` expressions, as evidenced in the current implementation for other mathematical expressions. The addition should preserve all existing functionalities of the `ccode` method, only extending it to recognize and properly convert `sinc(x)` expressions. Potential approaches include either directly implementing the conversion within the method based on detected `sinc(x)` patterns or leveraging the `user_functions` argument more effectively to allow users to specify custom conversions for unsupported functions like `sinc(x)`."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly buggy, this file might need a review or update to ensure that the definition and handling of `sinc(x)` within SymPy are conducive to conversion to C code via `ccode`. Specifically, the documentation or meta-information of `sinc(x)` could include hints or properties that `ccode` can utilize to recognize and convert `sinc(x)` expressions more effectively. Enhancing how `sinc(x)` is represented in the context of SymPy's elementary trigonometric functions could aid in its conversion to C code, ensuring a seamless process when such expressions are encountered by `ccode`. If `sinc(x)` is treated specially in terms of symbolic manipulation or simplification, such properties should be documented or coded in a way that `ccode` (or any code-printing routine) can easily translate it into the target language's idioms or library function calls, if available, or into a manually specified piecewise expression otherwise. This may imply refining the symbolic properties of `sinc(x)` to ensure they align with the expectations and capabilities of the code conversion routines."
