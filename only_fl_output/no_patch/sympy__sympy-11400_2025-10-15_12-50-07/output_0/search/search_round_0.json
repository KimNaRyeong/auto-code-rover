        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `ccode(sinc(x))` not working as expected, it would be helpful to first understand how the `ccode` function is implemented and how it deals with functions that are not directly supported in `math.h` like `sinc`. Here are the search API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"ccode\")`: Understanding the implementation of the `ccode` method will provide insights into how expressions are converted to C code.\n2. `search_code(\"sinc(x)\")`: To find where and how `sinc(x)` is specifically handled or mentioned within the project. This can reveal if there is already an attempted handling or translation for `sinc(x)` to C code.\n3. `search_code(\"Piecewise\")`: Since the issue references a workaround using `Piecewise((sin(theta)/theta, Ne(theta, 0)), (1, True))`, searching for `Piecewise` will help understand how piecewise functions are processed and converted to C code, which could be relevant for implementing support for `sinc(x)`."
