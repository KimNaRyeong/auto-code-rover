This Python script will attempt to reproduce the issue with generating C code for the `sinc` function using SymPy. It uses assertions to check if the `sinc(x)` conversion via `ccode` function is handled correctly, comparing it against handling via a manual `Piecewise` definition for the `sinc` function that yields valid C code.

If the issue described is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace pointing to where the issue occurred in the script. If the handling of `sinc(x)` is fixed in a future version of SymPy or if the problem is otherwise resolved, the script will exit with code 0 and print confirmation that the issue with `ccode(sinc(x))` has been fixed.
