        "intended_behavior": "This method iterates over watched files and yields their modified times. To resolve the issue, it should include a validation step for file paths to gracefully handle or skip paths that contain null bytes, thus preventing the 'ValueError: embedded null byte' exception. This validation could involve checking for and logging such paths without attempting to access their metadata or further process them. The existing functionality of monitoring file modifications for autoreload should be preserved. Error handling should be enhanced to ensure that encountering a problematic path does not halt the autoreload process, thus maintaining the development server's stability and responsiveness to legitimate changes."
