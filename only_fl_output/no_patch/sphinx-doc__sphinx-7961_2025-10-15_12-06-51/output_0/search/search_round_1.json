It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

Given the nature of the issue, we are particularly interested in the Sphinx extension or configuration file(s) that handle MathJax integration. Based on the description, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the MathJax extension class**: Since the issue mentions an extension, MathJax is likely integrated through a specific class or module in Sphinx. We should look for a class related to MathJax configuration or usage.\n   - `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n\n2. **Search for configuration or initialization method**: Upgrading MathJax might involve changes in initialization or configuration. Finding methods related to setting up or configuring MathJax will be helpful.\n   - `search_method(\"configure_mathjax\")`\n   - `search_method(\"init_mathjax\")`\n\n3. **Search for specific code snippets related to the current MathJax integration**: Identifying the current version setup or how MathJax script is included in the project could give us clues about where changes are needed.\n   - `search_code('MathJax.js')`\n   - `search_code(\"mathjaxConfig\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with the necessary context to understand how MathJax is currently integrated and configured within the Sphinx project, allowing us to plan the upgrade to version 3.0 accordingly."

This means we need to adjust our approach to find the relevant parts of the codebase. Here are some alternative steps we can take to gain the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx specific extension or configuration method names**: Since MathJax would be used in a Sphinx project, it's likely integrated within a Sphinx-specific setup or configuration file. Sphinx extensions often have specific naming conventions.\n   - `search_method(\"setup\")` \n   - `search_code(\"add_js_file\")`\n\nThese methods and code snippets are more aligned with the way Sphinx extensions typically integrate external tools like MathJax. \n\n2. **Broaden the search to include keywords related to JavaScript file inclusion**: Since MathJax operates as a JavaScript library, its integration in Sphinx would likely involve adding a JS file to the documentation build process.\n   - `search_code(\"add_javascript\")` \n\n3. **Look for template customization or HTML file manipulation**: Sometimes, direct integration of tools like MathJax could be managed through project templates or HTML customization. \n   - `search_code(\"html_static_path\")`\n   - `search_code(\".html\")` \n\nThese adjusted search parameters are designed to cast a wider net, potentially catching the relevant integration or configuration points for MathJax within the Sphinx project. They should help us to identify how MathJax is currently incorporated and provide clues on how to proceed with upgrading to version 3.0."

Since the initial API calls did not yield any direct references to MathJax or its configuration within the Sphinx project, the exact locations requiring changes or upgrades in the codebase cannot be pinpointed without additional context. However, since there are no results to analyze from the searches, it's challenging to accurately list bug locations or intended behavior without making some educated guesses based on common practices with Sphinx and MathJax integration:\n\n- **Buggy Files, Classes, and Methods**: Not specifically identified due to lack of direct search results.\n  \n- **Intended Behavior**: \n  - For upgrading to MathJax 3.0 within a Sphinx project, the intended behavior involves adjusting the way MathJax is included and configured in the Sphinx documentation build process. This typically would include:\n    - Updating the MathJax script reference to point to the version 3.0 script instead of a previous version.\n    - Modifying any JavaScript configuration specifically tailored for MathJax 2.x to be compatible with MathJax 3.0, according to the upgrading guide provided by MathJax.\n    - Ensuring that any custom configurations or extensions that interact with MathJax are tested and compatible with version 3.0.\n    - Adjusting Sphinx project settings, if necessary, to accommodate changes in MathJax loading or initialization. This might involve changes in Sphinx conf.py settings, theme customizations, or extensions.\n\nGiven the lack of specific code references, the bug locations and intended behavior described here are speculative based on common integration points of MathJax in documentation projects. For a more accurate assessment, a manual review of the project's documentation, Sphinx configuration files (e.g., `conf.py`), and any custom Sphinx extensions or theme files that might include MathJax integration would be necessary."
