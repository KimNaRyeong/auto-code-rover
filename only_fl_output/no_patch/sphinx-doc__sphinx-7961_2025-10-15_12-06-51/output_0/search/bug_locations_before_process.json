Since MathJax's configuration or inclusion didn't explicitly appear in the provided context, the action items might involve:\n- **Adding a Sphinx extension for MathJax 3.0**, if such an extension exists that directly supports or is updated for MathJax 3.0, it should be added to the `extensions` list.\n- **Customization through `setup` function**: Use the `setup` function to configure MathJax 3.0 specifics. This might involve adding to or modifying the JavaScript path for MathJax 3.0 if it is done manually. Utilize functions like `app.add_js_file()` to include the MathJax 3.0 script into the generated documentation.\n- **Ensure existing functionality**: Any changes made for upgrading to MathJax 3.0 should preserve the existing documentation's appearance and functionality, particularly in displaying mathematical content. This means thoroughly testing the integration to ensure compatibility with the new version of MathJax without losing functionality or styling.\n- **Documentation Update**: Update the project documentation to state the upgrade to MathJax 3.0 for transparency and to assist users in understanding any new MathJax features or syntax changes they can leverage within the Sphinx documentation."
