It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to upgrading MathJax to version 3.0 in the Sphinx MathJax extension, we need to focus on finding the relevant parts of the project where MathJax is configured and used. Given the nature of the issue, we are particularly interested in the Sphinx extension or configuration file(s) that handle MathJax integration. Based on the description, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. **Search for the MathJax extension class**: Since the issue mentions an extension, MathJax is likely integrated through a specific class or module in Sphinx. We should look for a class related to MathJax configuration or usage.\n   - `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n\n2. **Search for configuration or initialization method**: Upgrading MathJax might involve changes in initialization or configuration. Finding methods related to setting up or configuring MathJax will be helpful.\n   - `search_method(\"configure_mathjax\")`\n   - `search_method(\"init_mathjax\")`\n\n3. **Search for specific code snippets related to the current MathJax integration**: Identifying the current version setup or how MathJax script is included in the project could give us clues about where changes are needed.\n   - `search_code('MathJax.js')`\n   - `search_code(\"mathjaxConfig\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with the necessary context to understand how MathJax is currently integrated and configured within the Sphinx project, allowing us to plan the upgrade to version 3.0 accordingly."
