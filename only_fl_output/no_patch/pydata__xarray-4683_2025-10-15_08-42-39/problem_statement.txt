astype method lost its order parameter

**What happened**:
I upgraded from xarray 0.15.1 to 0.16.2 and the `astype` method seems to have lost the `order` parameter.

```python
In [1]: import xarray as xr

In [2]: xr.__version__
Out[2]: '0.16.2'

In [3]: xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).astype(dtype='d', order='F').values.strides
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-208ab49008ef> in <module>
----> 1 xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).astype(dtype='d', order='F').values.strides

TypeError: astype() got an unexpected keyword argument 'order'
```

**What you expected to happen**:
I was expecting to get the same result as with xarray 0.15.1:

```python
In [1]: import xarray as xr

In [2]: xr.__version__
Out[2]: '0.15.1'

In [3]: xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).astype(dtype='d', order='F').values.strides
Out[3]: (8, 16)
```

**Anything else we need to know?**:
Looking at the documentation it seems it disappeared between 0.16.0 and 0.16.1. The documentation at http://xarray.pydata.org/en/v0.16.0/generated/xarray.DataArray.astype.html
still has this snippet

> order ({'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional) – Controls the memory layout order of the result. ‘C’ means C order, ‘F’ means Fortran order, ‘A’ means ‘F’ order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous, ‘C’ order otherwise, and ‘K’ means as close to the order the array elements appear in memory as possible. Default is ‘K’.

(which was identical to the documentation from numpy.ndarray.astype at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html)

while http://xarray.pydata.org/en/v0.16.1/generated/xarray.DataArray.astype.html seems to lack that part.
