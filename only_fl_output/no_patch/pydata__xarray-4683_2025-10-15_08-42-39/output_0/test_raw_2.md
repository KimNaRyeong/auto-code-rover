Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script designed to check for the issue where the `astype` method in xarray loses its `order` parameter. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, showcasing details via the stack trace. It assumes that the issue is present in xarray version 0.16.2 but not in version 0.15.1. Please ensure the targeted version of xarray is installed in the environment before running this script.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        # Report the xarray version
        print(f"Testing with xarray version: {xr.__version__}")

        # Attempt to use the 'order' parameter with astype, expected to fail in version 0.16.2
        da = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        da.astype(dtype='d', order='F')
        print("Test passed: 'order' parameter is accepted by astype method.")
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'order'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("\nTest failed: 'order' parameter is not supported by astype method.")
            exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("\nTest failed due to an unexpected TypeError.")
            exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nTest failed due to an unexpected exception.")
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
- It tries to use the `astype` method with the `order` parameter on a `DataArray` object.
- If the `TypeError` is caught and matches the expected message, indicating that the `order` parameter is not recognized, it prints a stack trace of the error. This scenario indicates that the issue is present, aligning with the behavior reported for version 0.16.2.
- If the operation passes without raising an error, the script prints a message indicating success, suggesting that the issue has been resolved or is not present in the tested version.
- For any other types of errors (including unexpected `TypeError` messages), it prints a detailed stack trace.
- The script exits with status code 1 upon failure and 0 upon success.

Ensure this script is executed in an environment where the targeted xarray version is installed. Adjust the environment appropriately if you wish to test different versions of xarray.
