First, let's find the location and implementation details of the `astype` method within the `DataArray` class in the xarray codebase. We also want to verify if the implementation of `astype` has changed in a way that no longer includes the `order` parameter.\n\nTo do this, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")`: To get an overview of where the `DataArray` class is defined in the xarray project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"astype\", \"DataArray\")`: To find the implementation details of the `astype` method within the `DataArray` class.\n3. `search_code(\"dtype='d', order='F'\")`: To find any additional instances where the `astype` method is called with the `order` parameter, providing context on its usage."
