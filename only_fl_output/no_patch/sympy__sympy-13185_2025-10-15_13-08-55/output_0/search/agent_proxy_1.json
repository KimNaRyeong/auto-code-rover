The intended behavior includes enhancing the method to accurately recognize equivalent matrix indexing operations as common subexpressions. This could involve adjusting the preprocessing step to better account for expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` objects so that these expressions are not overlooked or improperly optimized. The existing functionality of handling scalar expressions and non-matrix symbolic objects should be preserved, ensuring the change specifically improves the handling of `MatrixSymbol` objects without impacting other functionalities.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py\n  - **Class:** MatrixSymbol\n  - **Method:** _eval_subs\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `_eval_subs` method within `MatrixSymbol` should ensure that substitutions involving matrix elements are carried out in a way that retains their symbolic relationships and ensures they are recognizable to the `cse` optimization process. If changes here are necessary, they should aim at making the expression substitutions involving `MatrixSymbol` indexing more consistent and recognizable for `cse`. Improvements can focus on how these objects are presented to `cse`, possibly by standardizing the form of substituted expressions or enriching the metadata around these substitutions to facilitate optimization. This change should make sure that the overall functionality of substitution in symbolic expressions, especially those involving matrices, is enhanced without affecting other operations and methods reliant on `_eval_subs`."
