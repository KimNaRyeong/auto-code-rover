Based on the direction provided, to correctly highlight the issue in question and ensure that `sys` is correctly imported, let's adjust the previous script accordingly. Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py` to accurately reflect the test scenario, including the explicit import of `sys` used for exiting the script with a status code:

```python
import sympy as sp
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sub_in_matrixsymbols(exp, matrices):
    for matrix in matrices:
        for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
            for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
                name = f"{matrix.name}_{i}_{j}"
                sym = sp.symbols(name)
                exp = exp.subs(sym, matrix[i, j])
    return exp

def t44(name):
    return sp.Matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: sp.symbols(f'{name}_{i}_{j}'))

def check_issue(matrix_a, matrix_b):
    """
    This function should reproduce the issue and raise an AssertionError
    if the behaviour is not as expected indicating the issue is present.
    """
    # Construct matrices of symbols
    a = t44(matrix_a)
    b = t44(matrix_b)

    # Set up expression.
    e = a * b

    # Put in matrixsymbols.
    e2 = sub_in_matrixsymbols(e, [sp.MatrixSymbol(matrix_a, 4, 4), sp.MatrixSymbol(matrix_b, 4, 4)])
    cse_subs, cse_reduced = sp.cse(e2)

    # Attempt to catch the issue here
    try:
        # If here: check the content of cse_subs and cse_reduced for the reported issue
        expected_subs_length = 34  # Including 'a' and 'b' as separate variables
        if not len(cse_subs) == expected_subs_length:
            raise AssertionError(f"Incorrect number of substitutions: expected {expected_subs_length}, got {len(cse_subs)}")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # If the issue is not present
    print("Issue is fixed. The test passed successfully!")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_issue("a", "b")
```

In this script:
- We have imported `sys` at the top to ensure `sys.exit` is available.
- The script attempts to reproduce a specific issue related to the `sympy.cse` function and its handling of matrices.
- It uses a nested function design to set up and check if the issue can be reproduced based on the previous description.
- If the expected conditions (e.g., the number of substitutions) are not met, it triggers an `AssertionError` and calls `print_stacktrace` to give detailed error output.
- On success (meaning the issue does not occur), it prints a success message and exits with code 0.
