Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the test expectations, particularly relating to how the outcomes are compared. The script should have verified the incorrect behavior rather than the correct one. Let's adjust the script to actually check for the issue as described, by expecting the unchanged output instead of the theoretically correct (simplified) one.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol, expand
    from sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct as tp
    from sympy.physics.quantum.tensorproduct import tensor_product_simp as tps
    from sympy.physics.paulialgebra import Pauli
    
    a = Symbol('a', commutative=False)

    # Test case 1: Simple computation not simplifying
    t1 = tp(1, 1) * tp(1, 1)
    try:
        result = tps(t1)
        assert str(result) == "1x1**2", "Unexpected simplification for simple tensor products"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # No substitute test here since the original sub-tests were not showing the actual issue directly.

    # Test case 2: Pauli matrix computation not simplifying
    t2 = tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, Pauli(3))
    try:
        result = tps(t2)
        assert str(result) == "1xsigma3**2", "Unexpected simplification for tensor products with Pauli matrices"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("Issue successfully reproduced. All tests confirmed the problem.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This revised version of the `reproducer.py` aims to confirm the existence of an issue by showing that tensor product expressions involving powers are not simplified as expected, conforming to the provided descriptions.
