It should ensure that expressions like `(tp(A,B) * tp(C,D))**n` expand correctly into `(A*C)**n x (B*D)**n`, preserving non-commutativity and other properties relevant to the tensor product operation. The fix should enhance the handling of powers within tensor products without altering the current functionality for other types of expressions."

The improvement should specifically ensure that it can effectively combine and simplify powers of tensor products, as demonstrated in the given examples. For example, when simplifying tensor products involving powers, it should accurately reduce expressions to their simplest form, respecting the mathematical properties of tensor products and the involved matrices or symbols."

Given the issue with tensor products involving `Pauli(3)` not simplifying as expected, adjustments here should ensure that powers of `Pauli` matrices are correctly interpreted and simplified when part of a tensor product. Consideration for the special properties of Pauli matrices (e.g., `sigma3**2 = 1`) should be accounted for to allow accurate simplifications."
