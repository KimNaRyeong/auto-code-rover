Based on the error received and your requirements, I'll adjust the approach to ensure the script is more suited for environments with xarray versions close to the context outlined in your issue. This time, let's ensure the environment is appropriately prepared to avoid runtime errors related to numpy or xarray incompatibilities. The previous script's failure due to an `AttributeError` suggests there's a version mismatch that affects the numpy usage within xarray. The adjusted script below will assume an environment compatible with the versions of xarray and other dependencies detailed in the issue report.

Please check the versions of xarray and numpy in your environment align with those expected for this reproduction script. The issue might require a specific environment setup with numpy versions before the breaking changes introduced in version 2.0, as highlighted by the `np.unicode_` error.

Here is the revised version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
        out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
        assert 'units' in out.attrs and out.attrs['units'] == 'K', "Attributes were expected but not preserved"
        print("Test passed: Attributes are preserved.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
```

**Notes for Execution:**

1. Ensure the python environment has the correct xarray version (`0.12.3` or similar) and numpy version compatible with the one you're testing against.
2. This script checks for attribute preservation directly and will exit with code `0` if the test passes, meaning the `keep_attrs` issue is not present. If the test fails, it exits with code `1` and prints a detailed stack trace.

**Additional Steps:**

- If you're unsure about the environment setup, consider creating a virtual environment matching the versions specified in the original issue.
- Be aware of potential deprecated numpy references like `np.unicode_`, ensuring compatibility between numpy and xarray versions used for the test.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to execute the script in a manner consistent with your requirements, even with potential version mismatches considered.
