Certainly! Here's how you can set up the `reproducer.py` to match your requirements. This script will specifically target the issue where `DataArray.quantile` does not honor `keep_attrs` in xarray, and it will use your provided function to print the stack trace when an assertion fails.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
    out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
    
    try:
        assert out.attrs, "Attributes not preserved"
        assert out.attrs.get('units') == 'K', "Expected attribute units='K' not found"
        print("Test passed: Attributes are preserved.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_quantile_keeps_attrs()
```

**Instructions for Use:**

1. Save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Run the script using Python 3, with the command: `python3 reproducer.py`.
3. The script will attempt to verify if the `DataArray.quantile` method properly preserves attributes when `keep_attrs=True` is specified.
    - If the issue is present, the script will print a stack trace of the failed assertion and exit with code `1`.
    - If the issue is not present (i.e., `keep_attrs` works as expected), the script will print a success message and exit with code `0`.

**Remarks:**

- This script assumes you have xarray installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip (`pip install xarray`) or conda (`conda install xarray`), depending on your Python environment setup.
- The script uses Python's standard `sys` and `traceback` modules to catch and print the assertion error, along with a stack trace for better debugging.
