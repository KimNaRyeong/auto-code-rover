        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location is to modify the queryset construction to use `_base_manager` instead of `_default_manager`. This change will ensure that the validation logic includes all instances of the related model, disregarding any exclusions imposed by custom managers. Preserving the existing functionality means the `validate` method should continue to accurately validate foreign key references, but it should do so in a manner that considers the entirety of the database, including soft-deleted or otherwise filtered-out instances by the default manager. This modification is crucial for situations where forms or other mechanisms rely on the inclusion of instances that are normally excluded by the default queryset of a model's manager."
