For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\n pass\nclass County(models.Model):\n name = CharField(max_length=50)\n state = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\n Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\n name=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\n status=Case(\n\tWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\n\tdefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\n status=Case(\n\tWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\n\tdefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n"
