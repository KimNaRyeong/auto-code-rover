This enhancement should enable developers to write more intuitive conditional expressions. The change must ensure that existing functionality, such as handling `Q` objects, boolean expressions, or lookups, remains unaffected.

Compatibility with other types of expressions and conditions used in `When` must be preserved, ensuring that any new logic specifically addresses the integration of `Exists` without disrupting the general utility of the `When` class for creating complex conditional queries in Django."
