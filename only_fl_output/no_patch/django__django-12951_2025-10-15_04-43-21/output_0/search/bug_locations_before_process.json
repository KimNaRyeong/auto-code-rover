        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of `When` should be modified to allow the direct use of an `Exists` expression along with keyword arguments, without the need to wrap them in a `Q` object. This enhancement should enable developers to write more intuitive conditional expressions. The change must ensure that existing functionality, such as handling `Q` objects, boolean expressions, or lookups, remains unaffected. Specifically, the method could be adapted to check for an `Exists` expression and seamlessly integrate it with other keyword arguments, akin to how the `filter` method processes its conditions.\nThe modification should seek to maintain backward compatibility and not introduce breaking changes for existing codebases relying on the current behavior of `When`. Compatibility with other types of expressions and conditions used in `When` must be preserved, ensuring that any new logic specifically addresses the integration of `Exists` without disrupting the general utility of the `When` class for creating complex conditional queries in Django."
