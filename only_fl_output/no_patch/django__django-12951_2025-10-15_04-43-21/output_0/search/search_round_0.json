        "content": "<issue>Cannot mix Exists expression with keyword arguments to When\nDescription\n(last modified by Ryan Heard)\nI don't seem to be able to provide an Exists expression to When alongside keyword arguments like you can with filter. For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the reported issue, we need information about the `When` class, the `Exists` expression, and possibly how they interact with the `Case` and `annotate` methods in the Django ORM. Specifically, we need to understand the implementation details of these components to propose a patch that allows an `Exists` expression to be mixed with keyword arguments in a `When` clause without requiring a `Q` object wrapper.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls:\n\n1. To investigate the `When` class and its initialization method, which seems to be at the heart of the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"When\")`\n   \n2. To look at the implementation of the `Exists` expression to see how it's structured and whether there's something specific about it that doesn't play well with `When`:\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n   \n3. Since the issue describes a problem with using `When` within the `annotate` method, we should also look into how `annotate` is implemented, particularly how it handles conditions within `When`:\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n4. The `Case` statement is also mentioned as part of the code where the issue arises, so understanding its implementation could be important:\n   - `search_class(\"Case\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a broad context of how these components are implemented within Django and help us identify where modifications can be made to support the described functionality."
