If the child class has the `__init__` method (using typed parameters) and I try to reassign the attribute from `Generic` class I got the following error:\n```text\nWARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:dry-python/returns.git\n$ cd returns\n$ poetry install\n$ cd docs\n$ poetry run make html\n```\nCode example:\n* Python script\n```python\nfrom typing import (\nClassVar,\nType,\nTypeVar,\nGeneric,\n)\n_ValueType = TypeVar('_ValueType')\nclass MyGeneric(Generic[_ValueType]):\n#: Doc comment example.\nsome_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\nclass MyGenericChild(MyGeneric[_ValueType]):\ndef __init__(self, inner_value: _ValueType) -> None:\npass\nMyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\n```\n* rst\n```rst\n.. test:\nTest\n====\n.. automodule:: lib.test\n:members:\n```\nIf you try to modify something in the script maybe the error will not appear, it's a very specific corner case!\n**Expected behavior**\nThe warning should not appear!\n**Your project**\n[returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux 5.7.9-1-MANJARO\n- Python version: 3.8.3\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:\n```text\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\nsphinx.ext.doctest\nsphinx.ext.todo\nsphinx.ext.coverage\nsphinx.ext.viewcode\nsphinx.ext.autosummary\nsphinx.ext.napoleon\nm2r\nsphinx_autodoc_typehints\nsphinxcontrib.mermaid\nhoverxref.extension\n```\n---\nrelated issue https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/568\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to doc comments, Generic classes, and Sphinx documentation warnings, we'll need to locate the main classes and methods mentioned in the bug report and understand how they are interacting within the `returns` project. Given the specific bug involves a `Generic` class, its subclass, and custom doc comments, searching for the class definitions and the Sphinx configuration might be a good starting point.\n\nOur API calls should be focused on:\n\n1. Finding the `MyGeneric` class to understand how generics are being used and how doc comments are initially set up.\n2. Finding the `MyGenericChild` class to see how it's extending the `MyGeneric` class and its `__init__` method's implementation.\n3. Understanding how Sphinx is configured in the project, which might require finding Sphinx-related setup or configurations, potentially within a `conf.py` file or similar, to investigate how autodoc and related extensions are set up.\n\nLet's start with the first two points:\n\n- `search_class(\"MyGeneric\")`: This will help us find where the `MyGeneric` class is defined within the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"MyGenericChild\")`: This will help locate the `MyGenericChild` class definition.\n\nGiven we are also dealing with documentation generation and facing a Sphinx specific warning, locating configuration files or scripts related to Sphinx could be useful, but such detailed search capability isn't directly provided in the available API calls. Instead, examining the code around where the classes and their relationships are defined might give us insight into annotations or configurations that could affect Sphinx doc processing.\n\nFor the third point, often Sphinx configuration is located in the `docs` directory, often in a file named `conf.py`:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"sphinx\", \"docs/conf.py\")`: This assumes there exists a `conf.py` in the `docs` directory where Sphinx is likely configured. This search is speculative based on common practices but is necessary for understanding possible sources of the warning.\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid starting point for diagnosing the issue by giving us insight into how generics are implemented and documented in the code, as well as how Sphinx is configured to generate project documentation."
