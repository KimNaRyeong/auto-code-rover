        "intended_behavior": "Before performing any comparisons to decide on simplification tactics (`if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` and subsequent comparisons), the method `_TR56` should first check if the exponent `rv.exp` is a complex number. If `rv.exp` is complex, the transformation that requires comparison with integer values should be bypassed, or an alternative method of simplification should be considered that is suitable for complex numbers. This way, the existing functionality for handling real number exponents is preserved, while also avoiding errors when faced with complex exponents."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `__lt__` method correctly identifies and raises a `TypeError` when attempting to compare complex numbers, a better approach might involve improving upstream logic (like in `_TR56`) to prevent such comparisons from being attempted in the first place. However, enhancements in `__lt__` could involve providing a more informative error message or documentation suggesting that the comparison of complex numbers should be handled differently. This method's intended behavior doesn't necessarily need to change; improvements are more about better error handling and guiding developers on correct usage."
