This script correctly imports and uses `I` from SymPy to reproduce the mentioned issue. It intentionally tries to execute a piece of code known to trigger the specific TypeError due to an invalid comparison of complex numbers within the simplification process of a trigonometric expression raised to the power of `I`. The script checks if the exception related to the issue is raised, prints a relevant stack trace if so, and exits appropriately.
