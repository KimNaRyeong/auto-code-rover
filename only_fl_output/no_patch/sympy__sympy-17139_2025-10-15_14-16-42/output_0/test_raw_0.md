This script attempts to reproduce the mentioned issue by executing code that should trigger an invalid comparison of complex `I` within the SymPy library. It includes a mechanism for confirming the presence of the specific exception related to this issue and printing a detailed stack trace of it. If the issue is present and triggers the expected exception, the script prints the stack trace and exits with code 0, indicating the reproduction was successful.
