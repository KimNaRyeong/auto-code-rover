Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to test the reported issue with the `biweight_location` function. This script checks if `biweight_location` returns `nan` for an array of constant values and raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present. If the issue is fixed, the script will successfully run without any errors and exit with code 0. The script utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clearer error output.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_constant_array():
    # Define a constant array
    constant_array = np.ones(4)
    try:
        # Attempt to calculate the biweight location
        result = biweight_location(constant_array)
        # Check if the result is not NaN
        assert not np.isnan(result), "biweight_location returned NaN for a constant array"
        assert result == 1.0, f"Expected biweight_location to return 1.0, got {result}"
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_biweight_location_constant_array()
```

To execute this script:
1. Save the script to a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Run the script using Python 3 by executing the command `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

This script will output a stack trace and exit with a non-zero status code if the issue is detected, facilitating the identification and verification of the bug.
