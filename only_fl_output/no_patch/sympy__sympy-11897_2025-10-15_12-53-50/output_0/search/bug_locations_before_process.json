While LaTeX offers more sophisticated formatting capabilities, the method should aim to represent mathematical expressions in a way that aligns with the conceptual representation done by the pretty printer. Adjustments might include handling of fractions, exponentials, logarithms, and symbol assumptions to closely match the structure presented by the pretty printer, without losing the mathematical fidelity or the expressive advantages of the LaTeX format."

        "intended_behavior": "The methods within the `PrettyPrinter` class responsible for printing fractions, exponentials, logarithms, and other expressions highlighted in the issue should be evaluated to ensure they are structurally and conceptually consistent with LaTeX output where feasible. While maintaining the readability and simplicity of the pretty print format, slight adjustments may be necessary to align both outputs more closely. This might involve modifying how the pretty printer simplifies expressions or represents certain mathematical constructs to minimize discrepancies with LaTeX representations, provided these changes do not compromise the clarity or the utility of the pretty printed output."
