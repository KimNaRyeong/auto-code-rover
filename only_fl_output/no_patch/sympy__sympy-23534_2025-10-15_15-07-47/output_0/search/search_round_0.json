The issue also relates to classes `Symbol` and `Function`, which the `symbols` method is expected to manipulate or deal with. Understanding these classes might provide insight into why the method behaves unexpectedly when additional parentheses are involved. Thus, I will search for these classes as well:\n   - `search_class(\"Symbol\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Function\")`"
