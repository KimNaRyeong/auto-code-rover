        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `symbols` method, when handling input intended to create function symbols (specifically with the use of the `cls=smp.Function` argument and involving an extra layer of parentheses for multi-symbol creation), should accurately differentiate between cases where symbols or function-like objects are being requested. It should respect the extra layer of parentheses as a hint towards creating tuples of symbol-like objects with the specified class (in this case, instances of `Function` or subtypes thereof), rather than defaulting to instances of `Symbol`. This differentiation logic needs to accurately parse the input arguments and adhere to the documented behavior, ensuring that when developers expect function objects, the method responds accordingly without mistakenly creating symbol objects due to the presence of additional parentheses. This adaptation should be done in a way that does not interfere with the current functionality for users not using the extra layer of parentheses, preserving backward compatibility and the broad utility of the `symbols` method for various use cases within Sympy."
