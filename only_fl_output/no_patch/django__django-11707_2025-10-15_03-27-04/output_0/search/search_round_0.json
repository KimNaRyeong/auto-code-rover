So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

Search for the `Subquery` class to get an overview and see how it's currently implemented. This will help us understand the structure and existing methods of the class.\n2. Search for the `__getstate__` method within the `Subquery` class if it exists, or alternatively, in the codebase to see how it's implemented elsewhere. This could provide insights into how it should be overridden.\n3. Search for the `BaseExpression` class to understand how the `_constructor_args` attribute is used, since the issue mentions that it's added by the `@deconstructible` decorator on this class. This could help in understanding the serialization behavior that needs to be fixed.\n4. Given that the issue talks about a commit that changed how `Subquery` handles the underlying query object, it might be helpful to search for any uses or mentions of `Subquery` and `BaseExpression` in the context of serialization (`pickle`), to see if there have been relevant changes or discussions around this topic.\n\nLet's proceed with the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Subquery\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getstate__\", \"Subquery\")`\n- `search_class(\"BaseExpression\")`\n- `search_code(\"pickle.dumps\")`\n- `search_code(\"@deconstructible\")`"
