So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context helps in understanding how to approach the issue regarding the pickling of `QuerySet` evaluations in `Subquery` annotations. Let's break down the results and address the questions posed:\n\n### Analysis of `Subquery` Class\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `Subquery` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` allows embedding a SQL statement within another SQL statement. It's used to perform subqueries in Django's ORM.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  The issue arises because the `Subquery` class, which should ideally not trigger the evaluation of its `QuerySet` when pickled, inadvertently does so. This is contrary to the expected behavior because the `Subquery` is supposed to only store the underlying query, not the `QuerySet`.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  When pickling a `Subquery`, the contained `QuerySet` should not be evaluated. This requires ensuring that serialization of a `Subquery` instance does not involve querying the database or evaluating the `QuerySet`.\n\n### `__getstate__` Method Search in `Subquery`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `__getstate__` method is used by Python to determine what state should be pickled. This method wasn't found in the `Subquery` class, which means it inherits its serialization behavior from its parents without any custom handling for Django's ORM specifics.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  The absence of a customized `__getstate__` method in `Subquery` implies that the default serialization behavior might inadvertently evaluate the `QuerySet` due to the way Django ORM constructs are serialized.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The method should be implemented to exclude the problematic attributes that lead to `QuerySet` evaluation, specifically `_constructor_args`, from the serialized state.\n\n### `BaseExpression` Class Context\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `BaseExpression` class serves as the foundation for building expressions like `Subquery`. It includes mechanisms for converting expressions to SQL, among other functionalities.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  The `BaseExpression` contains the serialization logic (`__getstate__` method) that the `Subquery` class inherits. As mentioned in the issue, the `@deconstructible` decorator adds `_constructor_args` which are getting inadvertently serialized.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The `BaseExpression` serialization process should either selectively prevent `_constructor_args` from causing a `QuerySet` evaluation or be overridden in `Subquery` to customize the serialization process.\n\n### `pickle.dumps` Search Context\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  `pickle.dumps` is used across different parts of Django to serialize objects into a byte stream. The references found indicate its usage throughout Django's components like sessions, cache backends, which might use similar patterns as the one causing the issue.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  These references provide examples of where and how Django uses pickling. Although they are not directly related to the `Subquery` issue, understanding common practices in Django might offer insights into handling serialization properly.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The usage of `pickle.dumps` should seamlessly serialize Django objects without triggering unintended side effects like `QuerySet` evaluation.\n\n### `@deconstructible` Decorator Context\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `@deconstructible` decorator is used to make classes ready for serialization by Django\u2019s migrations framework. Its presence on a class allows instances of that class to be serializable.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  This decorator is responsible for the addition of `_constructor_args`, as mentioned in the issue. This attribute's serialization plays a crucial role in the observed bug.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  Any class marked with `@deconstructible` should ensure its serialization doesn't inadvertently activate any ORM evaluation or database hits, aligning with Django's design principles.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, the next technical steps can include:\n- Implementing a custom `__getstate__` method within the `Subquery` class to explicitly exclude `_constructor_args` from the pickled state. This could directly address the issue without affecting global serialization mechanisms.\n- Additionally, reviewing other classes marked with `@deconstructible` might reveal similar patterns or issues, guiding a best practice for custom serialization in Django models and expressions.\n\nThis breakdown navigates towards a resolution by understanding the ORM's behavior better and identifying where the serialization mechanism needs adjustment to prevent unintended `QuerySet` evaluations."

This method should return the object's state minus the `_constructor_args` attribute to ensure that the `QuerySet` contained within a `Subquery` does not get evaluated upon pickling. This change would prevent the unintended evaluation of `QuerySet` when a `Subquery` instance is serialized, thus preserving the existing functionality while preventing the error described in the issue.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `django/db/models/expressions.py`, Class: `BaseExpression`.\n  - **Intended behavior:** While the `BaseExpression` class may not directly require modifications to fix this specific issue, understanding its `__getstate__` method and usage of `_constructor_args` is crucial for implementing the fix in the `Subquery` class. However, the analysis identifies that the immediate fix is localized to `Subquery`. Any modification here should ensure that custom serialization behaviors introduced do not negatively impact other expressions or components inheriting from `BaseExpression`.\n  \nThese locations identify where modifications are necessary to resolve the serialization issue while ensuring that the Django ORM continues to function as expected."
