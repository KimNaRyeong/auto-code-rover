        "intended_behavior": "Implement a custom `__getstate__` method to exclude `_constructor_args` from the serialization process. This method should return the object's state minus the `_constructor_args` attribute to ensure that the `QuerySet` contained within a `Subquery` does not get evaluated upon pickling. This change would prevent the unintended evaluation of `QuerySet` when a `Subquery` instance is serialized, thus preserving the existing functionality while preventing the error described in the issue."

However, the analysis identifies that the immediate fix is localized to `Subquery`. Any modification here should ensure that custom serialization behaviors introduced do not negatively impact other expressions or components inheriting from `BaseExpression`."
