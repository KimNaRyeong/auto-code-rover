Search for the `DataArray` class to find where it is defined, which will give us an entry point to explore methods like `to_dataframe` and `to_series`.\n   \n2. Search for the `to_dataframe` method in the entire codebase because the issue directly mentions this method failing under certain conditions. This will help us understand how multi-index dimensions are handled.\n\n3. Search for the `to_series` method in the entire codebase because this method is also mentioned as failing in the provided issue. Understanding its implementation will be crucial.\n\n4. Since the error involves `MultiIndex`, searching the project for how it interacts with `isna` could illuminate potential areas of incompatibility or reveal a workaround.\n\nGiven these considerations, the API calls are:\n\n- search_class(\"DataArray\")\n- search_method(\"to_dataframe\")\n- search_method(\"to_series\")\n- search_code(\"MultiIndex\")"
