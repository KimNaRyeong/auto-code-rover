Given the error you've encountered, it seems there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication. The error message indicates an installation or environment setup issue with scikit-learn rather than a reproduction of the reported issue itself. The ImportError suggests that the scikit-learn library is either not installed correctly or that the environment in which the test script is being run does not have access to a correct installation of scikit-learn.

Assuming that the Python environment and scikit-learn are correctly set up, the provided Python file should attempt to reproduce the original issue described, concerning `label_ranking_average_precision_score` and sample weighting. I will provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` file with these considerations in mind. If the original environment error persists, it suggests that there is a need to correctly install or configure scikit-learn within your project or environment.

Let's rewrite `reproducer.py` to properly test for the described issue with an environment that has scikit-learn correctly installed. This script is engineered to only test the logic issue regarding sample weighting in `label_ranking_average_precision_score`.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_label_ranking_issue():
    # Per sample APs are expected to be 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    try:
        # With the given weights, the third sample should not affect the outcome.
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0])
        expected_result = 0.625
        assert np.isclose(result, expected_result), (
            f"Expected result {expected_result}, but got {result}"
        )
        print("Test passed, the issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Test failed, the issue is not fixed.")
        raise

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_label_ranking_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script now focuses on the logic error, where it asserts whether the average precision score calculation respects the sample weighting as described, particularly in the case of samples with all zero labels. Before running the script, ensure that scikit-learn is correctly installed in the environment to avoid the previous installation-related errors.
