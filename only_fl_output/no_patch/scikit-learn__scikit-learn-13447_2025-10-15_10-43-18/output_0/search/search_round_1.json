        "content": "<issue>label_ranking_average_precision_score: sample_weighting isn't applied to items with zero true labels\n#### Description\nlabel_ranking_average_precision_score offers a sample_weighting argument to allow nonuniform contribution of individual samples to the reported metric.  Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function computes the ranking-based average precision for multilabel ranking problems. Within this function, we see logic to handle samples with either all labels relevant or unrelevant (lines 728-732), which are supposed to receive a default score of 1 because their ranking has no meaningful interpretation in this context.\n\nThe score calculation (lines 734-740) involves determining ranks of true labels and computing the mean of their normalized ranks. When `sample_weight` is provided, it adjusts this mean (auxiliary score) by multiplying the mean by the sample's weight.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe issue describes a scenario where the `sample_weight` argument does not correctly apply to samples that have all labels as either true or unrelevant (zero labels). According to the provided code snippets, when a sample has all labels relevant or unrelevant, the function increments the output score (`out`) by 1 directly (line 731), completely bypassing any sample weighting logic which is only applied later (line 739) for other cases.\n\nThis behavior leads to a situation where samples that should potentially contribute less to the overall metric (due to lower sample weights) might contribute a full score instead, skewing the final result. This is incorrectly treating the sample weight for these special cases.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be to incorporate `sample_weight` into the calculation for all samples, regardless of their label composition (all true, all false, or a mix). That means samples with all labels as true or false should still have their contribution to the final score adjusted by their respective weights, rather than adding a uniform score of 1 for each.\n\nThis would ensure that the `sample_weight` parameter uniformly affects the contribution of each sample to the final metric, in line with the general intention of sample weighting, which is to allow certain observations to contribute more or less to the overall metric, based on domain-specific considerations or sample importance.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nTo resolve the issue, the code needs modification to apply `sample_weight` uniformly across all samples, even those with all labels set to true or to false. This involves adjusting the logic around lines 731 to either incorporate `sample_weight` into the calculation or to reconsider how special cases are handled in relation to weighted samples. \n\nGiven this analysis, the next step would be to craft a patch that ensures sample weights are respected across all edge cases, which will align the function's behavior with expected scenarios, such as those illustrated in the issue description."

Bug Location 1:\n   - File: `sklearn/metrics/ranking.py`\n   - Method: `label_ranking_average_precision_score`\n   \n   Intended Behavior:\n   \n   To resolve the issue, the handling of samples with all labels true or all false needs to be adjusted to correctly apply `sample_weight`. Currently, these samples receive a fixed contribution of 1 to the `out` variable, without considering their `sample_weight`. The intended behavior is to multiply this contribution by the sample's weight before adding it to `out`. This ensures that each sample's contribution to the final score is proportional to its assigned weight, even if all labels for that sample are true or all are false. This adjustment should be made while ensuring that the existing functionality for other samples (where labels are a mix of true and false) remains unchanged.\n   \n   The specific code modification involves incorporating the `sample_weight` into the calculation at lines around 731 where it currently increments `out` by 1 for samples with all labels relevant or unrelevant. We should conditionally apply the sample weight similar to how it's done later in the function (at line 739 for the general case of samples). If `sample_weight` is not `None`, each special case sample's default score of 1 should be multiplied by the corresponding sample weight before adding to the total score (`out`)."
