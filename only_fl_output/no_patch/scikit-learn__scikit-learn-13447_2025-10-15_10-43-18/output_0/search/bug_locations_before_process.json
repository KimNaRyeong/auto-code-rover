        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the handling of samples with all labels true or all false needs to be adjusted to correctly apply `sample_weight`. Currently, these samples receive a fixed contribution of 1 to the `out` variable, without considering their `sample_weight`. The intended behavior is to multiply this contribution by the sample's weight before adding it to `out`. This ensures that each sample's contribution to the final score is proportional to its assigned weight, even if all labels for that sample are true or all are false. This adjustment should be made while ensuring that the existing functionality for other samples (where labels are a mix of true and false) remains unchanged.\n\nThe specific code modification involves incorporating the `sample_weight` into the calculation at lines around 731 where it currently increments `out` by 1 for samples with all labels relevant or unrelevant. We should conditionally apply the sample weight similar to how it's done later in the function (at line 739 for the general case of samples). If `sample_weight` is not `None`, each special case sample's default score of 1 should be multiplied by the corresponding sample weight before adding to the total score (`out`)."
