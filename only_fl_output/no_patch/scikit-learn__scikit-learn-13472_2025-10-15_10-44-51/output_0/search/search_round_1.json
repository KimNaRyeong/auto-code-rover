        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how the issue might be resolved or approached further.\n\n### Analysis of `GradientBoostingRegressor` Class\nThe `GradientBoostingRegressor` class inherits from `BaseGradientBoosting` and `RegressorMixin`, suggesting it implements gradient boosting for regression problems. The class initializer (`__init__`) lists several parameters, including `init=None`, which can be used to specify an initial estimator. This aligns with the issue described, where an attempt to use a `Pipeline` as the `init` estimator results in an error. The issue arises from how this `init` parameter is used within the fitting process, specifically with how the `fit` method of the initial estimator is called.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\nThe bug involves the calling convention used when invoking the `fit` method on the initial estimator defined within the `GradientBoostingRegressor`. The issue description suggests that `self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight)` does not match the `Pipeline` class's `fit` method signature, which accepts `X`, `y`, and `**fit_params`. This mismatch leads to the `TypeError`.\n\n### Analysis of the `Pipeline.fit` Method\nThe `Pipeline.fit` method is designed to fit all the transformers in the pipeline sequentially and finally use the transformed data to fit the final estimator. It accepts `X`, `y`, and `**fit_params`, with `fit_params` allowing additional parameters to be passed to the `fit` methods of the transformers and the final estimator within the pipeline. This method's flexible signature is designed to accommodate various needs but clashes with the direct call with a `sample_weight` positional argument.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior should allow a `Pipeline` to be used as the initial estimator within `GradientBoostingRegressor`. To accommodate this, the call to the initial estimator's `fit` method should adhere to a compatible interface that respects both the potential for passing `sample_weight` and the flexibility of `**fit_params`.\n\n### Missing Context and Next Steps\nThe failed attempt to get the code around line 1421 in `gradient_boosting.py` leaves a gap in understanding how exactly `self.init_.fit()` is called within `GradientBoostingRegressor`. Knowing the exact implementation details would clarify whether the suggested patch in the issue (using `sample_weight=sample_weight`) is viable or if alternative adjustments are needed.\n\nTo fill in this context, considering the error in retrieving the file content, an alternative approach might be to search more broadly in the `gradient_boosting.py` file for references to `init_` or the 'fit' method's invocation that might hint at the handling of the initial estimator. This can be achieved by broader search terms or a direct examination of the source code if accessible.\n\nGiven the failed specific file search, alternative strategies include:\n- Searching for the method `fit` within the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class to find how the initial estimator is utilized.\n- Looking into the implementation details of `BaseGradientBoosting` since `GradientBoostingRegressor` extends it, and the issue might stem from how `BaseGradientBoosting` handles its `fit` procedure, especially with respect to initial estimators.\n\n**Next API Calls:**\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n- `search_class(\"BaseGradientBoosting\")`"

To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to ensure compatibility with the signature of `Pipeline.fit`. This means adjusting the calling convention to pass `sample_weight` as a named argument within `**fit_params` if `self.init_` is indeed a pipeline (or supports `**fit_params`). This change would allow users to use a `Pipeline` as the initial estimator without encountering a `TypeError`.\n\n   The modified implementation should check if `self.init_` can accept `sample_weight` directly or as part of `**fit_params` and then adapt the call accordingly. This ensures that the functionality is preserved when using custom estimators as the initial model while adding support for `Pipeline` objects. The check could involve inspecting the `fit` method signature of `self.init_` or safely attempting to pass `sample_weight` and adjusting based on the outcome.\n\n   This solution seeks to maintain existing functionalities for all current users of `GradientBoostingRegressor` while extending its flexibility to allow `Pipeline` objects as initial estimators, thus solving the reported issue without breaking compatibility with other parts of the scikit-learn framework."
