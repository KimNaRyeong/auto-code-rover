This means adjusting the calling convention to pass sample_weight as a named argument within **fit_params if self.init_ is indeed a pipeline (or supports **fit_params). This change would allow users to use a Pipeline as the initial estimator without encountering a TypeError. The modified implementation should check if self.init_ can accept sample_weight directly or as part of **fit_params and then adapt the call accordingly. This ensures that the functionality is preserved when using custom estimators as the initial model while adding support for Pipeline objects. The check could involve inspecting the fit method signature of self.init_ or safely attempting to pass sample_weight and adjusting based on the outcome. This solution seeks to maintain existing functionalities for all current users of GradientBoostingRegressor while extending its flexibility to allow Pipeline objects as initial estimators, thus solving the reported issue without breaking compatibility with other parts of the scikit-learn framework."

2220 class GradientBoostingRegressor(BaseGradientBoosting, RegressorMixin):
2221     """Gradient Boosting for regression.
2222 
2223     GB builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion;
2224     it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions.
2225     In each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the
2226     given loss function.
2227 
2228     Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.
2229 
2230     Parameters
2231     ----------
2232     loss : {'ls', 'lad', 'huber', 'quantile'}, optional (default='ls')
2233         loss function to be optimized. 'ls' refers to least squares
2234         regression. 'lad' (least absolute deviation) is a highly robust
2235         loss function solely based on order information of the input
2236         variables. 'huber' is a combination of the two. 'quantile'
2237         allows quantile regression (use `alpha` to specify the quantile).
2238 
2239     learning_rate : float, optional (default=0.1)
2240         learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.
2241         There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.
2242 
2243     n_estimators : int (default=100)
2244         The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting
2245         is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually
2246         results in better performance.
2247 
2248     subsample : float, optional (default=1.0)
2249         The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base
2250         learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient
2251         Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.
2252         Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance
2253         and an increase in bias.
2254 
2255     criterion : string, optional (default="friedman_mse")
2256         The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
2257         are "friedman_mse" for the mean squared error with improvement
2258         score by Friedman, "mse" for mean squared error, and "mae" for
2259         the mean absolute error. The default value of "friedman_mse" is
2260         generally the best as it can provide a better approximation in
2261         some cases.
2262 
2263         .. versionadded:: 0.18
2264 
2265     min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
2266         The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
2267 
2268         - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
2269         - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
2270           `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
2271           number of samples for each split.
2272 
2273         .. versionchanged:: 0.18
2274            Added float values for fractions.
2275 
2276     min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
2277         The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
2278         A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
2279         least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
2280         right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
2281         especially in regression.
2282 
2283         - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
2284         - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
2285           `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
2286           number of samples for each node.
2287 
2288         .. versionchanged:: 0.18
2289            Added float values for fractions.
2290 
2291     min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
2292         The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
2293         the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
2294         equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
2295 
2296     max_depth : integer, optional (default=3)
2297         maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum
2298         depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter
2299         for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction
2300         of the input variables.
2301 
2302     min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
2303         A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
2304         greater than or equal to this value.
2305 
2306         The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
2307 
2308             N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
2309                                 - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
2310 
2311         where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
2312         samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
2313         left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
2314 
2315         ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
2316         if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
2317 
2318         .. versionadded:: 0.19
2319 
2320     min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
2321         Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
2322         if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.
2323 
2324         .. deprecated:: 0.19
2325            ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
2326            ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
2327            ``min_impurity_split`` will change from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
2328            will be removed in 0.25. Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.
2329 
2330     init : estimator or 'zero', optional (default=None)
2331         An estimator object that is used to compute the initial predictions.
2332         ``init`` has to provide `fit` and `predict`. If 'zero', the initial
2333         raw predictions are set to zero. By default a ``DummyEstimator`` is
2334         used, predicting either the average target value (for loss='ls'), or
2335         a quantile for the other losses.
2336 
2337     random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
2338         If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
2339         If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
2340         If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
2341         by `np.random`.
2342 
2343     max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
2344         The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
2345 
2346         - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
2347         - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
2348           `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
2349           split.
2350         - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
2351         - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
2352         - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
2353         - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
2354 
2355         Choosing `max_features < n_features` leads to a reduction of variance
2356         and an increase in bias.
2357 
2358         Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
2359         valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
2360         effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
2361 
2362     alpha : float (default=0.9)
2363         The alpha-quantile of the huber loss function and the quantile
2364         loss function. Only if ``loss='huber'`` or ``loss='quantile'``.
2365 
2366     verbose : int, default: 0
2367         Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints progress and performance
2368         once in a while (the more trees the lower the frequency). If greater
2369         than 1 then it prints progress and performance for every tree.
2370 
2371     max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
2372         Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
2373         Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
2374         If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
2375 
2376     warm_start : bool, default: False
2377         When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
2378         and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just erase the
2379         previous solution. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
2380 
2381     presort : bool or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
2382         Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
2383         fitting. Auto mode by default will use presorting on dense data and
2384         default to normal sorting on sparse data. Setting presort to true on
2385         sparse data will raise an error.
2386 
2387         .. versionadded:: 0.17
2388            optional parameter *presort*.
2389 
2390     validation_fraction : float, optional, default 0.1
2391         The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
2392         early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
2393         Only used if ``n_iter_no_change`` is set to an integer.
2394 
2395         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2396 
2397     n_iter_no_change : int, default None
2398         ``n_iter_no_change`` is used to decide if early stopping will be used
2399         to terminate training when validation score is not improving. By
2400         default it is set to None to disable early stopping. If set to a
2401         number, it will set aside ``validation_fraction`` size of the training
2402         data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not
2403         improving in all of the previous ``n_iter_no_change`` numbers of
2404         iterations.
2405 
2406         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2407 
2408     tol : float, optional, default 1e-4
2409         Tolerance for the early stopping. When the loss is not improving
2410         by at least tol for ``n_iter_no_change`` iterations (if set to a
2411         number), the training stops.
2412 
2413         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2414 
2415 
2416     Attributes
2417     ----------
2418     feature_importances_ : array, shape (n_features,)
2419         The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).
2420 
2421     oob_improvement_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
2422         The improvement in loss (= deviance) on the out-of-bag samples
2423         relative to the previous iteration.
2424         ``oob_improvement_[0]`` is the improvement in
2425         loss of the first stage over the ``init`` estimator.
2426 
2427     train_score_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
2428         The i-th score ``train_score_[i]`` is the deviance (= loss) of the
2429         model at iteration ``i`` on the in-bag sample.
2430         If ``subsample == 1`` this is the deviance on the training data.
2431

2433         The concrete ``LossFunction`` object.
2434 
2435     init_ : estimator
2436         The estimator that provides the initial predictions.
2437         Set via the ``init`` argument or ``loss.init_estimator``.

2440         The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
2441 
2442     Notes
2443     -----
2444     The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
2445     the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and
2446     ``max_features=n_features``, if the improvement of the criterion is
2447     identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best
2448     split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting,
2449     ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

</code><intended_behavior>The code within this location, specifically where it calls self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight), is intended to correctly initialize the regressor using the provided initial estimator. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to ensure compatibility with the signature of Pipeline.fit. This means adjusting the calling convention to pass sample_weight as a named argument within **fit_params if self.init_ is indeed a pipeline (or supports **fit_params). This change would allow users to use a Pipeline as the initial estimator without encountering a TypeError. The modified implementation should check if self.init_ can accept sample_weight directly or as part of **fit_params and then adapt the call accordingly. This ensures that the functionality is preserved when using custom estimators as the initial model while adding support for Pipeline objects. The check could involve inspecting the fit method signature of self.init_ or safely attempting to pass sample_weight and adjusting based on the outcome. This solution seeks to maintain existing functionalities for all current users of GradientBoostingRegressor while extending its flexibility to allow Pipeline objects as initial estimators, thus solving the reported issue without breaking compatibility with other parts of the scikit-learn framework.</intended_behavior>]

2221     """Gradient Boosting for regression.
2222 
2223     GB builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion;
2224     it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions.
2225     In each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the
2226     given loss function.
2227 
2228     Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.
2229 
2230     Parameters
2231     ----------
2232     loss : {'ls', 'lad', 'huber', 'quantile'}, optional (default='ls')
2233         loss function to be optimized. 'ls' refers to least squares
2234         regression. 'lad' (least absolute deviation) is a highly robust
2235         loss function solely based on order information of the input
2236         variables. 'huber' is a combination of the two. 'quantile'
2237         allows quantile regression (use `alpha` to specify the quantile).
2238 
2239     learning_rate : float, optional (default=0.1)
2240         learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.
2241         There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.
2242 
2243     n_estimators : int (default=100)
2244         The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting
2245         is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually
2246         results in better performance.
2247 
2248     subsample : float, optional (default=1.0)
2249         The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base
2250         learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient
2251         Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.
2252         Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance
2253         and an increase in bias.
2254 
2255     criterion : string, optional (default="friedman_mse")
2256         The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
2257         are "friedman_mse" for the mean squared error with improvement
2258         score by Friedman, "mse" for mean squared error, and "mae" for
2259         the mean absolute error. The default value of "friedman_mse" is
2260         generally the best as it can provide a better approximation in
2261         some cases.
2262 
2263         .. versionadded:: 0.18
2264 
2265     min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
2266         The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
2267 
2268         - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
2269         - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
2270           `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
2271           number of samples for each split.
2272 
2273         .. versionchanged:: 0.18
2274            Added float values for fractions.
2275 
2276     min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
2277         The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
2278         A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
2279         least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
2280         right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
2281         especially in regression.
2282 
2283         - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
2284         - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
2285           `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
2286           number of samples for each node.
2287 
2288         .. versionchanged:: 0.18
2289            Added float values for fractions.
2290 
2291     min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
2292         The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
2293         the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
2294         equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
2295 
2296     max_depth : integer, optional (default=3)
2297         maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum
2298         depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter
2299         for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction
2300         of the input variables.
2301 
2302     min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
2303         A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
2304         greater than or equal to this value.
2305 
2306         The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
2307 
2308             N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
2309                                 - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
2310 
2311         where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
2312         samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
2313         left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
2314 
2315         ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
2316         if ``sample_weight`` is passed.
2317 
2318         .. versionadded:: 0.19
2319 
2320     min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
2321         Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
2322         if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.
2323 
2324         .. deprecated:: 0.19
2325            ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
2326            ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
2327            ``min_impurity_split`` will change from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
2328            will be removed in 0.25. Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.
2329 
2330     init : estimator or 'zero', optional (default=None)
2331         An estimator object that is used to compute the initial predictions.
2332         ``init`` has to provide `fit` and `predict`. If 'zero', the initial
2333         raw predictions are set to zero. By default a ``DummyEstimator`` is
2334         used, predicting either the average target value (for loss='ls'), or
2335         a quantile for the other losses.
2336 
2337     random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
2338         If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
2339         If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
2340         If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
2341         by `np.random`.
2342 
2343     max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
2344         The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
2345 
2346         - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
2347         - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
2348           `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
2349           split.
2350         - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
2351         - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
2352         - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
2353         - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
2354 
2355         Choosing `max_features < n_features` leads to a reduction of variance
2356         and an increase in bias.
2357 
2358         Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
2359         valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
2360         effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
2361 
2362     alpha : float (default=0.9)
2363         The alpha-quantile of the huber loss function and the quantile
2364         loss function. Only if ``loss='huber'`` or ``loss='quantile'``.
2365 
2366     verbose : int, default: 0
2367         Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints progress and performance
2368         once in a while (the more trees the lower the frequency). If greater
2369         than 1 then it prints progress and performance for every tree.
2370 
2371     max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
2372         Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
2373         Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
2374         If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
2375 
2376     warm_start : bool, default: False
2377         When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
2378         and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just erase the
2379         previous solution. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.
2380 
2381     presort : bool or 'auto', optional (default='auto')
2382         Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
2383         fitting. Auto mode by default will use presorting on dense data and
2384         default to normal sorting on sparse data. Setting presort to true on
2385         sparse data will raise an error.
2386 
2387         .. versionadded:: 0.17
2388            optional parameter *presort*.
2389 
2390     validation_fraction : float, optional, default 0.1
2391         The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
2392         early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
2393         Only used if ``n_iter_no_change`` is set to an integer.
2394 
2395         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2396 
2397     n_iter_no_change : int, default None
2398         ``n_iter_no_change`` is used to decide if early stopping will be used
2399         to terminate training when validation score is not improving. By
2400         default it is set to None to disable early stopping. If set to a
2401         number, it will set aside ``validation_fraction`` size of the training
2402         data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not
2403         improving in all of the previous ``n_iter_no_change`` numbers of
2404         iterations.
2405 
2406         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2407 
2408     tol : float, optional, default 1e-4
2409         Tolerance for the early stopping. When the loss is not improving
2410         by at least tol for ``n_iter_no_change`` iterations (if set to a
2411         number), the training stops.
2412 
2413         .. versionadded:: 0.20
2414 
2415 
2416     Attributes
2417     ----------
2418     feature_importances_ : array, shape (n_features,)
2419         The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).
2420 
2421     oob_improvement_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
2422         The improvement in loss (= deviance) on the out-of-bag samples
2423         relative to the previous iteration.
2424         ``oob_improvement_[0]`` is the improvement in
2425         loss of the first stage over the ``init`` estimator.
2426 
2427     train_score_ : array, shape (n_estimators,)
2428         The i-th score ``train_score_[i]`` is the deviance (= loss) of the
2429         model at iteration ``i`` on the in-bag sample.
2430         If ``subsample == 1`` this is the deviance on the training data.
2431 
2432     loss_ : LossFunction
2433         The concrete ``LossFunction`` object.
2434 
2435     init_ : estimator
2436         The estimator that provides the initial predictions.
2437         Set via the ``init`` argument or ``loss.init_estimator``.

2439     estimators_ : array of DecisionTreeRegressor, shape (n_estimators, 1)
2440         The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
2441 
2442     Notes
2443     -----
2444     The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
2445     the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and
2446     ``max_features=n_features``, if the improvement of the criterion is
2447     identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best
2448     split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting,
2449     ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

</code><intended_behavior>The code within this location, specifically where it calls self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight), is intended to correctly initialize the regressor using the provided initial estimator. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to ensure compatibility with the signature of Pipeline.fit. This means adjusting the calling convention to pass sample_weight as a named argument within **fit_params if self.init_ is indeed a pipeline (or supports **fit_params). This change would allow users to use a Pipeline as the initial estimator without encountering a TypeError. The modified implementation should check if self.init_ can accept sample_weight directly or as part of **fit_params and then adapt the call accordingly. This ensures that the functionality is preserved when using custom estimators as the initial model while adding support for Pipeline objects. The check could involve inspecting the fit method signature of self.init_ or safely attempting to pass sample_weight and adjusting based on the outcome. This solution seeks to maintain existing functionalities for all current users of GradientBoostingRegressor while extending its flexibility to allow Pipeline objects as initial estimators, thus solving the reported issue without breaking compatibility with other parts of the scikit-learn framework.</intended_behavior>]
