        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for creating a patch to address the issue of SQLite version incompatibility with window functions and how Django handles it, I need to explore several parts of Django's codebase. Here are the API calls I would make to obtain this context:\n\n1. Identify where Django checks the SQLite version to see if there's a pre-existing mechanism that can be extended or if a new check needs to be implemented. Since the issue pertains to SQLite database usage, it's likely within Django's database backend for SQLite. I will search for code responsible for establishing database connections or executing SQL commands as a starting point.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"sqlite3.connect\")\nsearch_code(\"execute\")\n```\n\n2. Django raises exceptions for database errors through a layer that wraps around the database calls. I need to see how Django currently handles `OperationalError` for SQLite, as this is the exception type mentioned in the issue. This might involve searching for where `OperationalError` is caught and re-raised as `django.db.utils.OperationalError`.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"OperationalError\")\n```\n\n3. Investigate Django's handling of database features based on version compatibility. This includes looking for any mechanism that Django uses to conditionally enable or disable features based on the database version. This might be part of the database backend initialization or a utility function/module.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"database features\")\nsearch_code(\"version compatibility\")\n```\n\n4. Finally, to properly address the issue and contribute a fix, I should look at how window functions are integrated into Django's ORM, specifically how the `Window` expression and `RowNumber` function are processed. This will provide clues on where to inject the version check or how to gracefully degrade when window functions are not supported by the SQLite version in use.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Window\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"RowNumber\", \"Window\")\n```\n\nThese searches will give me a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of Django's codebase that I need to understand and modify to resolve the issue described."
