If the SQLite version is detected to be less than 3.25.0, the method should raise a `NotSupportedError` (or a similar custom exception) that clearly indicates window functions are not supported on the connected SQLite version. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality by allowing window function usage on supported database versions while providing clear error handling for unsupported versions."
