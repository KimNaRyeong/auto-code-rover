This script checks if the SQLite library included with Python supports window functions by executing a SQL query that uses such a function (`row_number()` in this case). If the SQLite version does not support window functions, as expected in versions pre 3.25.0, it should raise an `sqlite3.OperationalError` due to syntax error. The script captures and prints the exception stack trace for debugging purposes. If the issue is fixed, meaning SQLite supports window functions, an AssertionError is triggered indicating that the expected operational error did not occur, assuming the issue is resolved.
