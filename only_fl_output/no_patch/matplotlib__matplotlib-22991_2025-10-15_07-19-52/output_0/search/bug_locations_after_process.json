        "intended_behavior": "The `sca(ax)` method should not only set the current Axes but also correctly handle when `ax` is part of a `SubFigure`. The method attempts to set the current figure to the parent of `ax` but fails with a `SubFigure` because it does not properly interpret it as a valid figure object. The method should include a check or an adaptation layer that correctly identifies and sets a `SubFigure` as the current figure context in a way that maintains backwards compatibility and current functionality for standard `Figure` objects. This might involve adjusting how the `figure()` function, invoked within `sca`, validates and processes its argument when a `SubFigure` is passed."
