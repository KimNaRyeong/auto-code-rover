        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we need to understand how `plt.sca()` works with axes and how subfigures are handled within the Matplotlib library. This includes identifying the internal workings and interactions of the `sca` method, the `SubFigure` class (if it exists), and potentially how axes are registered or recognized as current by Matplotlib. Given this, I will execute a series of API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. Understand `plt.sca()` method's implementation, especially how it interacts with axes or SubFigure objects.\n2. Look into the `SubFigure` class, assuming it's a distinct class, to understand its properties and how it might be integrated within the context of `plt.sca()`.\n3. Since the error message mentions an issue converting `SubFigure` to an `int`, it indicates that the problem might involve how figures or subfigures are recognized or processed. Therefore, we need to investigate how figures are typically managed in the context of setting the current axis or figure.\n\nThe specific API calls to perform are:\n- search_method(\"sca\")\n- search_class(\"SubFigure\")\n- search_code(\"int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'SubFigure'\")"
