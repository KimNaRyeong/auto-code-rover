Given the feedback indicating the need for a correct approach, let's adhere strictly to the requirements for demonstrating the originally reported issue. Here's the revised version of `reproducer.py`, which is intentionally crafted to capture and report on the specific problem described. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        fig = plt.figure()
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(2, 1)

        axarr = subfigs[0].subplots(2, 2)

        plt.sca(axarr[0, 0])
        # This part of the code should not be reached if the issue is present.
        return False

    except TypeError as e:
        if "argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'SubFigure'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            return True  # Indicates the issue was reproduced.
        else:
            raise

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issue_reproduced = test_issue()
    if issue_reproduced:
        raise AssertionError("Issue with plt.sca() on axes created using subfigures detected.")
    else:
        print("No issues detected, which may indicate the problem has been fixed.")
```

This Python script (`reproducer.py`) is structured to intentionally raise an `AssertionError` if the specific issue with `plt.sca()` is successfully reproduced. The `print_stacktrace` function is included to output detailed tracebacks, making diagnosis clearer. The `test_issue` function strictly expects to trigger a `TypeError` under specific conditions described in the messagebox. If those conditions are met, it confirms the presence of the bug; otherwise, it either reports a possibly resolved issue or raises unexpected errors for further investigation.
