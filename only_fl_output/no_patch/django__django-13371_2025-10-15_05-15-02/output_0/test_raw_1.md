Based on the feedback and given requirements, I'll provide a generic version of the `reproducer.py` which avoids specific project configuration dependencies. This version will not depend on an external Django project setup but will instead attempt to create a minimal Django environment within the script itself. Keep in mind that this approach might require adjustments to fit into an actual project or to fully mimic a real Django environment context.

```python
import sys
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
import pickle


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django settings to bootstrap the environment
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        'testapp',
    ),
    TIME_ZONE='UTC',
    USE_TZ=True,
)

# Dynamically create a new app and model
app_name = "testapp"

try:
    os.mkdir(app_name)
except FileExistsError:
    pass

with open(os.path.join(app_name, "__init__.py"), "w") as f:
    pass

with open(os.path.join(app_name, "models.py"), "w") as f:
    f.write("""
from django.db import models

class ModelA(models.Model):
    value = models.CharField(max_length=12)
    """)

django.setup()

# Now running the migrate command to create the database schema
execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

# Importing the model after setup
from testapp.models import ModelA
from django.db import models


def main():
    try:
        # Make sure there is a ModelA instance
        ModelA.objects.create(value='Test value')

        # Attempt to reproduce the reported issue
        row = ModelA.objects.values_list('id', 'value', named=True).first()
        pickle.dumps(row)  # This line is expected to raise an exception if the issue exists
        print("No issue detected. Object pickled successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to dynamically create a minimal Django project with a single app (`testapp`) and a model (`ModelA`). It then tries to reproduce the issue described: attempting to pickle the named tuple obtained from `ModelA.objects.values_list('id', 'value', named=True).first()`.

Please note:

- The database setup uses SQLite for simplicity; no external database configuration is required.
- The app creation and migration steps are rudimentary and might not reflect best practices for Django app management. This script is meant solely for the purpose of reproducing the specified issue in a self-contained environment.
- Make sure to have Django installed in your environment to run this script. You can install Django via pip with the command `pip install django`.
