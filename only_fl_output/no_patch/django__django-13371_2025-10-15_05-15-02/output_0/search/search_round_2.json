        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `values_list` Method in the `QuerySet` Class\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `values_list` method in `django/db/models/query.py` allows for the retrieval of a subset of fields from the database, optionally flattening the results into a list of values or, when `named=True`, returning named tuples (instances of a dynamically created class) instead. When `flat` and `named` are both specified, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  This method is directly related to the bug as it generates the named tuples (`Row` objects) that are reported as not being pickleable. The specification of `named=True` leads to the creation of these `Row` objects.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  For objects returned by `values_list(named=True)` to be pickleable, allowing for serialization and caching functionalities to work seamlessly with these objects. The issue arises when trying to serialize these named tuple instances (`Row`) using `pickle.dumps`, which fails due to the named tuples not being recognized as pickleable objects.\n\n#### 2. The `Row` Class\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The search did not find a class named `Row` within the codebase, which suggests that the `Row` class is not a concrete class defined in a static manner but rather dynamically generated, likely as instances of named tuples or a similar construct that mimics named tuples' behavior.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  Since the `Row` class could not be found, it implies the pickling issue might be related to the dynamic nature of how these `Row` instances are created or how they're defined within Django's ecosystem.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  Ideally, instances of `Row` should be both dynamically generated and serializable (pickleable), enabling their use in caching mechanisms or any scenario requiring serialization.\n\n### Potential Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the analysis and the missing information about the `Row` class definition, we need to dive deeper into how Django generates these `Row` instances and why they're not directly recognized as pickleable by the Python `pickle` module. Since the `Row` class wasn't found directly, and it's likely dynamically generated (possibly in the `NamedValuesListIterable` as hinted in the `values_list` method), the next steps could involve:\n\n1. Investigating `NamedValuesListIterable` to understand how `Row` instances are created and structured.\n    - Perhaps `search_class(\"NamedValuesListIterable\")` or `search_code_in_file(\"NamedValuesListIterable\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` could provide more insight.\n\n2. Exploring how Django ensures other dynamically generated classes are pickleable to apply a similar approach to `Row`.\n    - This might involve looking into Django's serialization mechanisms or utilities that handle dynamic classes.\n\n3. Examining how named tuples could be made pickleable if Django's `Row` is indeed based on them.\n    - This may not require an API call but rather an analysis of Python's documentation on named tuples and pickling.\n\n4. Reviewing Django's cache and serialization modules given the references to `pickle.dumps` to see if there are custom serialization hooks or methods that could be adapted for `Row`.\n    - Examining the context in which `pickle.dumps` is used within Django could highlight whether there's a pattern or utility that can be extended to support `Row` instances."

What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `NamedValuesListIterable` class in `django/db/models/query.py` is responsible for the iteration behavior when a `QuerySet`'s `values_list` method is called with `named=True`. This class likely transforms the rows fetched from the database into named tuples, giving each field in the result set a name. The presence of a method named `create_namedtuple_class` suggests it dynamically generates classes based on the names of the fields requested, which are then instantiated and yielded during iteration.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe `NamedValuesListIterable` class is directly related to the bug as it handles the creation of `Row` objects that cannot be pickled. The issue arises during the instantiation and return of these `Row` instances, which, due to their dynamic nature, are not recognized by Python's `pickle` module as being serializable.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be for `NamedValuesListIterable` to generate `Row` instances that are pickleable. This could involve ensuring the dynamically created namedtuple classes are defined in a context where the `pickle` module can find and serialize them. For example, ensuring that these classes are part of a module's namespace might make them pickleable. Alternatively, if making them directly pickleable is not feasible due to the dynamic nature of their creation, implementing custom `__reduce__` methods might be necessary to provide the `pickle` module with the information needed to serialize and deserialize these objects correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor `NamedValuesListIterable` to resolve the issue, the way it dynamically creates named tuple classes needs to be adjusted to ensure these objects are serializable by default. This could mean either modifying how these classes are instantiated and stored to make them pickleable or adding custom serialization support."
