        "intended_behavior": "This class needs to be adapted so that its method of creating named tuples (`Row` instances) results in objects that are inherently pickleable. This could involve revising the `create_namedtuple_class` static method to ensure that the named tuple classes it generates are created in a module-level scope (or equivalently accessible scope for pickling), hence making them recognizable and serializable by the `pickle` module.\nThe existing functionality, which dynamically generates named tuples based on the fields specified in `values_list(named=True)` calls, must be preserved. However, the method of registering or instantiating these named tuple classes may need to be altered to ensure they are pickleable. This could potentially be achieved by defining these classes within a module's namespace, instead of purely dynamically in memory, or by implementing custom serialization methods (`__reduce__` or similar) for these dynamically generated classes.\n\nEnsuring that instances of `Row` can be pickled would enhance Django's compatibility with various caching mechanisms, including those that rely on pickling for serialization, without fundamentally altering how developers use the `values_list` method in their projects."
