        "content": "For resolving the issue about `django.db.models.query.Row` not being pickleable, I'll need to gather context about the classes and methods involved in creating and handling instances of `Row`, especially how `Row` objects are generated by `QuerySet.values_list()` with the `named=True` flag, and any attempt to pickle them. Let's proceed with the following API calls to get this context:\n\n1. To understand how `Row` objects are created, we should look into the `values_list` method within the `QuerySet` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"values_list\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n2. Since the error involves pickling of `Row` class instances, it's crucial to find out more about the `Row` class itself:\n   - `search_class(\"Row\")`\n\n3. Also, understanding how `QuerySet` is defined and how it interacts with models can provide insight into possible modifications for making `Row` instances pickleable:\n   - `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n\n4. Lastly, given that the issue mentions a problem with the pickling process, it would be useful to see if there are explicit references to the pickle module or pickling mechanisms within the context of `Row` objects or more broadly within Django's model query functionalities:\n   - `search_code(\"pickle.dumps\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Row\")` \n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `Row` objects are handled, generated, and how they can potentially be modified to support pickling, addressing the reported issue."
