The existing functionality for returning named tuples from `values_list` should be preserved, with the only difference being the added capability for these objects to be pickled. This is crucial for enabling Django models fetched with `values_list(named=True)` to be compatible with caching mechanisms that rely on object serialization, such as the `cacheops` package mentioned in the issue."
