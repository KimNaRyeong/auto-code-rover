This script, when executed, runs a test that attempts to use the `header_rows` argument with the `ascii.rst` format in `astropy`'s table write method, which is not supported and thus would raise a `TypeError`, as described in the issue. 

It captures the standard output (`stdout`) to prevent it from actually printing to the console during the test. The test function `test_restructuredtext_output_with_header_rows()` attempts to use the `header_rows` argument, captures and prints the exception stack trace if an error occurs, and raises an `AssertionError` if no error is caused by `header_rows` being usedâ€”indicating that the issue might be fixed if there's no error.

The script exits with code 0 only if the function finds the issue is fixed, which, as per the described behavior, means not raising a `TypeError` upon using `header_rows` with `ascii.rst` format. Otherwise, it prints the stack trace of the error encountered.
