To adhere to your specifications and create a script that reproduces the described issue regarding the `header_rows` argument in the RestructuredText output format for `astropy` tables, below is the detailed standalone script. This script, named `reproducer.py`, is designed to demonstrate the problem explicitly and check for its resolution, following the guidelines you provided for error reporting and exit codes.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import io
    try:
        tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

        # Redirecting output to avoid printing on screen
        output = io.StringIO()
        
        # First attempt without header_rows to check default behaviour
        tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst")
        
        # Trying with header_rows, which is expected to fail according to the issue
        tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
        
        print("The issue was not reproduced. Header rows are supported in ascii.rst format.")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 indicating the issue is fixed or not present
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising an assertion error to indicate the issue is still present
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present. ascii.rst format does not support header_rows.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 indicating the script confirmed the issue's presence
```

This script attempts to use the `header_rows` option with the `ascii.rst` format in `astropy`. It captures the `TypeError` thrown due to the unsupported `header_rows` option in this format. When the issue is not fixed, and the error is raised, the script prints a detailed stack traceback to assist in identifying the code location where the exception originated. 

Please ensure `astropy` and its dependencies are correctly installed and up to date in your environment to avoid external errors like the `ModuleNotFoundError`. If there are environment-related issues or package dependencies missing (like the `packaging` module in the previous error logs), you should resolve these by installing the required packages (e.g., using pip install `packaging` if `packaging.version` is missing).
