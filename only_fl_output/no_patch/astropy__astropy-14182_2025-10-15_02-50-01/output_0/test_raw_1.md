Given your requirements, let's write an updated version of `reproducer.py` tailored to capture the specific issue with `header_rows` in `ascii.rst` format, ensuring it complies with the problem statement and actively demonstrates if the issue persists or is resolved. This approach revisits the inclusion of all required components and error handling mechanisms in the script.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback 
    import sys 
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    try:
        tbl = QTable({'wave': [350,950]*u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2]*u.count})
        tbl.write('/dev/null', format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
        # If the execution reaches this point, it means the functionality is supported which should not happen as per the issue.
        print("The functionality seems to be supported now.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present. `header_rows` argument is not supported for `ascii.rst` format.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate the test failed (issue is still present)
```

This revised version strictly adheres to your guidelines for troubleshooting: it attempts to use the `header_rows` parameter with `ascii.rst` format and anticipates raising a `TypeError`. The script properly handles this exception by printing a detailed stack trace and exits with code 0 if the operation succeeds unexpectedly, indicating a resolution to the reported problem. On catching the expected `TypeError`, it reaffirms the issue's persistence and exits with code 1 following the printing of the captured stack trace, thereby fulfilling both the reproduction of the issue and facilitating debugging efforts based on the stack trace provided.
