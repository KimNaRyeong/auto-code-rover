Since the issue is about the `write` method specifically related to writing tables in the rst format, relevant findings would likely be within `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` or where the `write` method of `RST` is invoked.\n    - **Relationship with the bug**: While the search results provide a broad overview of where `write` methods appear, the crucial links are where these methods interact with the `RST` writer or are specifically related to the use case described in the issue.\n    - **Intended behavior**: The `write` method implementations related to `RST` output need to correctly handle `header_rows` to produce the desired formatted output.\n\n3. **Snippet from `astropy/io/ascii/core.py`**:\n    - This code snippet is from the `_get_writer` function. It shows how writer instances are created with `writer_kwargs`, which are filtered keyword arguments not including some `extra_writer_pars`.\n    - **Relationship with the bug**: This function is likely a central place where writers (including the `RST` writer) are instantiated. The TypeError in the issue trace (`RST.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows'`) occurs because `writer_kwargs` may include `header_rows`, which `RST.__init__` cannot handle.\n    - **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior would imply modifying either the `RST` class to accept `header_rows` or adjusting how `writer_kwargs` are prepared before instantiating the `RST` writer so that it does not pass unsupported arguments.\n\nBased on this analysis, the next step in addressing the issue should involve either:\n- Extending the `RST` class to accept and utilize the `header_rows` argument appropriately, ensuring that it can generate header rows in the output.\n- Modifying how `writer_kwargs` are managed in `_get_writer` to ensure that unsupported arguments are not passed to writers not designed to handle them, although based on the user requirement, the former seems more in line with fixing the actual issue.\n\nGiven these insights, further actions should include a deeper investigation into how the `RST` class's `write` method operates and considering code changes that might allow `header_rows` to be processed correctly."

This will allow users to pass custom headers that can be used in the output, aligning with the functionality provided for other formats like `ascii.fixed_width`. The `write` method inside the `RST` class might also need modifications to correctly render these header rows in the rst output format. The objective is to preserve its existing functionality (rendering tables in rst format) while extending it to support custom header rows.\n\n**Intended Behavior for the RST class**:\n- Modify the `__init__` method of the `RST` class to accept a `header_rows` argument. This argument should be optional and handled in such a way that existing functionality is not impacted if it's not provided.\n- Enhance the `write` method (or relevant method within the class that generates the output) to check for the presence of `header_rows`. If present, these should be properly formatted and included in the output before the data rows. This implies that the output generation logic needs to be adaptive based on the presence of header rows, inserting them as additional rows at the beginning of the output table, formatted according to the rst standard.\n- Ensure that this modification does not affect other writer classes or the overall functionality of the `write` method for scenarios where `header_rows` is not used, ensuring backward compatibility."
