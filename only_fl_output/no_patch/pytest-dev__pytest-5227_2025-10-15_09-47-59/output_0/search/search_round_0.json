The description mentions a desire to include the `name` (module name) and possibly the relative path in the log format.\n\nHere are the specific API calls to execute:\n\n1. **Search for the Code Snippet where `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is defined:** This will help us find the file and the exact location where the default logging format is set.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT =\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Get Code Around the Definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`:** Once we know the file(s) where `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is defined, we can view the surrounding code to understand its context, how it's used, or if it's being modified elsewhere within the same file. Suppose the definition is found in `settings.py` at line `50`, we would perform the following action for each file found (the file name and line number would be adjusted based on the results from the previous step):\n\n   ```python\n   get_code_around_line(\"settings.py\", 50, 5)\n   ```\n   \nThese API calls should provide us with an understanding of where and how the default logging format is established, which is crucial for evaluating the proposed enhancement and planning the implementation of including the module name and possibly the relative path in the log output."
