        "content": "<issue>Switching to inline backend closes GUI windows\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nWhen a plot is made with the `qt5` backend on and then the backend is changed to `inline`, the active plot window(s) are closed. This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\n- always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\n- use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure.\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\n```python\n# Paste your code here\n@contextmanager\ndef window(block=False):\n%matplotlib qt5\nplt.ioff()\nyield\nplt.show()\n# The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\nplt.ion()\n%matplotlib inline\nwith window():\nplt.plot([1, 3, 2])\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\n**Expected outcome**\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system:\n* Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\n* Python version: 3.7.3\n* Jupyter version (if applicable):\n```\njupyter                           1.0.0\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\n```\n</issue>"

The context manager described in the issue involves making calls to switch Matplotlib's backend to `qt5` for GUI interaction and then back to `inline` for inline plotting in a Jupyter Notebook. Understanding the mechanisms of backend switching and plot displaying will be critical. \n\nI will perform the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the code responsible for handling the `%matplotlib` magic command, as this is crucial for backend switching in Jupyter Notebooks.\n2. Search for anything related to the handling of `plt.show()` as its behavior seems to be central to the issue, specifically how it interacts with different backends.\n3. Investigate how `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()` (interactive mode on and off) are implemented and used, as these are mentioned in the code snippet provided in the issue.\n\nGiven these requirements, the API calls I'll invoke are:\n\n- `search_code(\"%matplotlib\")`: Since `%matplotlib` is a magic command unique to IPython/Jupyter environments, this will help find how the project handles or interacts with this command, particularly in the context of backend switching.\n  \n- `search_method(\"show\")`: This will help us understand the `plt.show()` method's behavior across different backends, which seems crucial for this issue.\n\n- `search_code(\"ion()\")`: To understand how enabling/disabling interactive mode is handled in the codebase.\n\n- `search_code(\"ioff()\")`: Similarly, this will help understand how the codebase manages turning the interactive mode off, which could impact the GUI window's persistence."

        "content": "The collected context provides insights into how Matplotlib handles interactive mode and backend switching, particularly relevant to the issue at hand. Let's analyze the returned results based on the prompts:\n\n### Analysis of `%matplotlib` Search Results\n\n- The `%matplotlib` magic command appears in various files including `__init__.py`, `pyplot.py`, and in documentation or tutorial files (`galleries/tutorials/images.py`, `galleries/examples/text_labels_and_annotations/autowrap.py`). This indicates that the handling of the `%matplotlib` magic command is possibly distributed across initialization and plotting utilities, with `pyplot.py` being a central player in managing these settings.\n\n### Relationship to the Issue:\n\n- The issue involves switching backends from `qt5` to `inline` within a Jupyter Notebook, which directly relates to how the `%matplotlib` magic command is processed. The presence of the command in `pyplot.py` suggests that modifications or fixes might be required in how `pyplot` handles backend switches, ensuring GUI windows remain open when expected.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\n\n- Ideally, the code handling the `%matplotlib` magic command should allow for seamless backend switching without closing active plot windows until explicitly closed by the user. This would involve maintaining GUI windows' state independently of backend switches or finding a way to tag certain figures to remain open across backend changes.\n\n### Analysis of `show()` Search Results\n\n- The `show()` method appears in backend-related files, indicating its behavior might differ across different backends (like `backend_bases.py`, `backend_qt.py`, and others). This is crucial since the issue describes a problem that arises when transitioning between backends.\n\n### Relationship to the Issue:\n\n- Since the `show()` method is fundamental to displaying plots, its implementation across different backends is directly related to the bug. The issue arises when switching the backend closes the GUI window, suggesting that the `show()` method might be interacting differently when the backend changes, especially moving back to `inline` from `qt5`.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\n\n- The behavior of `show()` should be consistent in terms of plot visibility, regardless of the backend used. When switching back to `inline` from `qt5`, it should not automatically close the GUI window but instead adhere to the user's explicit commands for closing or maintaining windows.\n\n### Analysis of `ion()` and `ioff()` Search Results\n\n- The search results for `ion()` and `ioff()` provide insight into how Matplotlib's interactive mode is toggled. These are found in `pyplot.py`, indicating that these methods control whether figures are automatically shown (interactive on) or require explicit commands to display (interactive off).\n\n### Relationship to the Issue:\n\n- The interactive mode controlled by `ion()` and `ioff()` is central to the issue. The context manager described aims to temporarily switch to a non-interactive mode (`ioff()`), then switches backends, and finally returns to the interactive mode. Understanding how these states impact plot visibility and backend behavior is key to addressing the bug.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\n\n- The intended behavior would involve `ioff()` successfully disabling automatic display of plots without affecting the openness of GUI windows. Upon switching back to `inline`, the interactive mode should be restored (`ion()`) without closing previously opened GUI windows.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the issue and the analysis, it's clear that adjustments need to be made in how backend switching interacts with plot display modes (`show()`, `ion()`, and `ioff()`). Specifically, ensuring that figures opened in GUI mode remain unaffected by backend switches or interactive mode toggling. The next steps would involve exploring the implementation details in `pyplot.py` and backend-specific files to craft a solution that addresses these requirements."

Specifically, this involves preserving the state of GUI windows upon backend switches. Methods related to backend switching and interactive mode toggling (`ion()`, `ioff()`) may need to be modified to check the current backend and manage GUI windows accordingly, without closing them unintentionally. The exact implementation would depend on identifying a method to tag certain figures to remain unaffected by backend changes or maintaining a global state of figures that should not be closed upon backend switches.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This file, which is likely involved in the fundamental implementation of display mechanisms across backends, may require modifications to the `show()` method implementations specific to different backends. The adjustments should ensure that figures designated to remain open (perhaps through a mechanism introduced in `pyplot.py`) are not closed when the backend switches to `inline`. This could involve enhancing the `show()` method or related utility functions to acknowledge the new state management logic introduced in `pyplot.py` for backend switching, maintaining the figure's visibility as needed.\n\nThese locations and changes aim to respect the underlying issue's requirements while ensuring that existing functionalities related to plotting and backend management in Matplotlib are preserved. The goal is to allow figures opened in GUI modes to persist across backend changes without altering the normal behavior when such persistence is not explicitly requested by the user."
