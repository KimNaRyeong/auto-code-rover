Given the information and requirement to adapt the script based on the feedback, here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`. This version does not rely on external tools like `xwininfo` and does not assume a specific backend's availability. It checks the presence of figures before and after the backend switch to indirectly test if the figures were closed as a result of the backend change. However, it's worth noting this method might not precisely capture the original issue's technical specifics as described but aims to adhere to the spirit of the problem within the constraints provided.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.backend_bases import FigureManagerBase
from contextlib import contextmanager
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

@contextmanager
def switching_backends():
    original_backend = plt.get_backend()
    try:
        plt.switch_backend('Qt5Agg')
    except ValueError:
        # Fallback for environments without Qt5Agg, like headless servers
        plt.switch_backend('agg')
        print("Fallback to 'agg' backend due to missing 'Qt5Agg'", file=sys.stderr)

    try:
        plt.ioff()
        yield
        num_figures_before = len(plt.get_fignums())
        plt.show()
        
        # Switch back to the original backend
        plt.ion()
        plt.switch_backend(original_backend)

        num_figures_after = len(plt.get_fignums())

        # Check if figures are closed by backend switch
        assert num_figures_before == num_figures_after, "Figures were closed after switching back to the original backend"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

with switching_backends():
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([1, 3, 2])

# The script exits with code 0 when the issue doesn't occur.
sys.exit(0)
```

This script tries to handle the backend switch more generally. It tests the issue of figures potentially being closed upon switching back by comparing the number of figures before and after the backend change. This generic approach aims to work across different environments, including those running headlessly where GUI backends like 'Qt5Agg' are not available.

Note: This script uses a generic method to measure if figures are preserved through backend switches by counting the available figures. It won't directly capture GUI windows closing but assumes if the figure count changes, it indicates the figures were improperly handled during the backend switch. This might not fully replicate the GUI closing but is designed within the guideline's constraints to detect a similar class of issues.
