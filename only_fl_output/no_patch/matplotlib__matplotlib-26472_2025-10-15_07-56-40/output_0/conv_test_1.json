This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\r\n - always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\r\n - use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\r\n\r\n**Code for reproduction**\r\n\r\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure. \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\r\n\r\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\r\n\r\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\r\n```python\r\n# Paste your code here\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef window(block=False):\r\n    %matplotlib qt5\r\n    plt.ioff()\r\n    yield\r\n    plt.show()\r\n    # The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\r\n    plt.ion()\r\n    %matplotlib inline\r\n\r\nwith window():\r\n    plt.plot([1, 3, 2])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual outcome**\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\r\n\r\n**Expected outcome**\r\n\r\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\r\n\r\n**Matplotlib version**\r\n<!--Please specify your platform and versions of the relevant libraries you are using:-->\r\n  * Operating system:\r\n  * Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\r\n  * Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\r\n  * Python version: 3.7.3\r\n  * Jupyter version (if applicable):\r\n```\r\njupyter                           1.0.0\r\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\r\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\r\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\r\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\r\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\r\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\r\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\r\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\r\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--Please tell us how you installed matplotlib and python e.g., from source, pip, conda-->\r\n<!--If you installed from conda, please specify which channel you used if not the default-->\r\n\r\n\n"

The script checks if the GUI window is still alive after switching back to the inline backend by looking for windows with \"Qt5Agg\" in their details, which is a simplification and may not work perfectly because this script directly checks X11 windows and assumes a Unix-like environment where X11 utilities are available. The `AssertionError` is triggered when the desired condition is not met, providing a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. \n\nPlease note, for this script to run correctly, utilities like `xwininfo` must be available, and it is specifically written under the assumption of a Linux environment with X11. Adaptations might be needed for other environments or if the method for determining window existence should be different."
