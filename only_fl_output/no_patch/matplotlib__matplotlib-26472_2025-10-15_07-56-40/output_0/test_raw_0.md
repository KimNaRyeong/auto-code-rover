This script attempts to reproduce the issue described by creating a plot with the Qt5 backend in a context manager, then switching back to the inline backend and trying to assert the presence of Qt5Agg windows using `xwininfo`. The script checks if the GUI window is still alive after switching back to the inline backend by looking for windows with "Qt5Agg" in their details, which is a simplification and may not work perfectly because this script directly checks X11 windows and assumes a Unix-like environment where X11 utilities are available. The `AssertionError` is triggered when the desired condition is not met, providing a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. 

Please note, for this script to run correctly, utilities like `xwininfo` must be available, and it is specifically written under the assumption of a Linux environment with X11. Adaptations might be needed for other environments or if the method for determining window existence should be different.
