Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's address the described issue more appropriately with an updated version of `reproducer.py`. This script aims to reproduce the specific issue you've described with the `CountVectorizer` ignoring the `input` argument when a custom analyzer is applied.

```python
# reproducer.py

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Since CountVectorizer with input='filename' expects file paths,
        # we'll generate a simple text file example to fit the expected input.
        filename = 'temp_test_file.txt'
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write('hello world')
        
        # Create CountVectorizer with a custom analyzer
        # Note: It's expected that this custom analyzer should not be applied
        # when input type is 'filename' as the data preprocessing from filename
        # to data should be handled internally by CountVectorizer before applying
        # any analyzer. However, the issue depicts that this is not being respected.
        cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')

        # Fitting the model with the path to the created file instead of direct string data.
        cv.fit([filename])
        vocabulary = cv.vocabulary_

        # Check if 'hello' and 'world' are correctly part of the vocabulary,
        # which would indicate the file content was directly split by the custom analyzer,
        # ignoring the 'input' = 'filename' specification.
        assert 'hello' in vocabulary and 'world' in vocabulary, "Custom analyzer did not ignore 'input=filename' as expected."
        
        # Clean up file after test
        os.remove(filename)

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os.remove(filename)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error

    # Exiting with code 0 indicating the issue has been fixed when this part is reached without any exceptions
    print("No issues encountered. It seems the behavior with 'input' argument and custom analyzer has been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script writes a text file and runs the `CountVectorizer` expecting it to handle the file input as per the `input='filename'` argument. Since it's mentioned that the custom analyzer should not change the behavior again (implying it perhaps should not ignore such arguments), the script checks precisely for this behavior. If the issue persists, the custom analyzer would still directly process the input string, disregarding the `input='filename'` instruction, which is what the assertion checks for. If the assertion fails, it indicates the issue remains unresolved, and the stack trace is printed out.
