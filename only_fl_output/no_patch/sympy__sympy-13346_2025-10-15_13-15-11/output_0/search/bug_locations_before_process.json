        "intended_behavior": "The `DeferredVector` class, specifically in its interaction with `lambdify` and related tests, should have clarified expectations about output types. To resolve the issue, documentation or the test expectation should be updated to reflect that the output can be in floating-point format if the underlying computation defaults to floating-point arithmetic. This adjustment acknowledges the behavior seen when NumPy is not available, ensuring that the doctest is aligned with the actual behavior of the code in diverse environments."
