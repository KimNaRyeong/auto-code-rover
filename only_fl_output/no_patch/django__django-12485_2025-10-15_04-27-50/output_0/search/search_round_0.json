However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "Given the issue description, we need to gather context specifically about the handling of multipart parsing in Django, particularly focusing on the filename handling in content-dispositions of form-data where filenames may be wrapped in double quotes, causing an inconsistency in the final parsed filename. The relevant areas of exploration include the class that deals with multipart parsing, and any methods or code fragments related to parsing the filename from the content disposition. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the class or method in Django that handles multipart parsing. Given the context of the issue, it's likely to be involved with parsing form-data or handling HTTP request parsing, specifically multipart/form-data. Therefore, we should look for a class that might be named something around \"MultiPartParser\" or similar:\n   - `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that CPython has compatibility for a related situation and provides a link to test cases handling header parsing, it suggests that the problem might be related to how headers or multipart sections with filenames are parsed. However, since our target is Django, we should specifically focus on how Django might integrate or implement similar parsing logic for multipart/form-data. Look for methods that might be directly involved with parsing or cleaning filenames from the content-disposition in multipart/form-data:\n   - `search_method(\"parse_header\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_filename\")`\n\n3. The issue specifically calls out a discrepancy when filenames are provided with double quotes around them. This suggests there might already be logic in place for handling filenames in request bodies that doesn't correctly handle double quotes. Therefore, searching for code snippets related to parsing filenames in the context of form-data might provide useful context:\n   - `search_code('filename=\"')`\n\n4. Given that the problem involves parsing and possibly sanitizing or normalizing filenames within HTTP requests, examining the specific implementation for handling `filename` and `filename*` parameters in content-disposition headers would be critical. Since the bug report mentions that double quotes are not correctly trimmed, looking for code handling these aspects would be essential:\n   - `search_code('Content-Disposition')`\n   - `search_code('filename*')`\n\nThese API calls should provide a broad context of how Django is currently handling multipart parsing, especially in relation to extracting filenames from content-disposition headers. With this information, one can start to pinpoint where adjustments or enhancements might be needed to handle double-quoted filenames more gracefully, aligning with the compatibility mentioned for CPython."
