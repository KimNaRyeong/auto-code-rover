Given the request, it appears there was a misunderstanding or execution error previously, as the provided code is specifically designed for a scenario where the Python environment includes necessary libraries like `numpy` and `sympy`. If there's an error due to a missing module such as `numpy`, it indicates the Python environment where the script is executed does not have these modules installed. To address this prerequisite, ensure that Python is correctly set up with `numpy` and `sympy` installed:

1. Install Python 3 (if not already installed).
2. Ensure `pip` is installed.
3. Install required packages by running `pip install numpy sympy`.

After setting up the environment correctly, this script should work as intended. Here's the script again for convenience:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify
    
    try:
        X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 2, 2)
        xx = np.random.rand(4, 4)  # Original issue arises with a 4x4 float matrix

        # Inversion in numpy works but is not our focus
        np.linalg.inv(xx)

        # Inversion with sympy through lambdify
        X0Inv = X0**-1
        symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv)
        result = symInv(xx)  # The line expected to raise an error if issue is present

        # If the process reaches this line without an error, the issue is presumed fixed
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is reproducible.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script checks for the issue described and uses the provided function to print a clear stack trace on failure. If the environment setup is correct and the modules are correctly installed, but the script still does not execute as expected, the issue might be related to the version of the libraries, Python itself, or a misunderstanding of the requirements. Ensure that your `numpy` and `sympy` libraries are up to date, or adjust the script accordingly to match the functionality available in the versions you are using.
