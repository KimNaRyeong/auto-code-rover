The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Location of Scatter Method:**\n   - The `scatter` method appears in multiple files, including `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`, `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. The two most relevant locations for addressing the issue at hand are likely `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` because these would contain the core definitions of the plotting functions that the users directly interact with. The mentions in `mpl_toolkits` might refer to 3D scatter plots, which could be affected by similar kwargs handling but are slightly less central to the issue described.\n\n2. **Usage of Linewidths and Edgecolors:**\n   - The `linewidths` and `edgecolors` snippets are found across several files, with significant concentrations in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` for `edgecolors`, and similarly, both attributes are mentioned extensively in `_axes.py` for `linewidths`. This suggests that the primary handling and validation of these kwargs likely occur within these sections of the code. The frequency and distribution of these attribute names indicate that they are integral to multiple plotting functions and configurations, potentially affecting not just scatter plots but other plot types as well.\n\n**Analytical Findings:**\n\n1. **Functionality and Relationship to the Bug:**\n   - The parts of the code where `scatter` is defined and where `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are used are crucial for controlling plot appearance. The issue stems from the code\u2019s ability to accept both singular and plural forms of these parameters without clear precedence or error handling when both are specified, leading to confusion and potential misuse.\n\n2. **Intended Behavior in Relation to the Issue:**\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be to either clearly define a precedence of singular over plural (or vice versa) or to introduce explicit error handling when both forms are provided by the user. This would help downstream libraries and their users to better understand and utilize the plotting functions without ambiguity. The existing precedents for argument handling and validation in other parts of matplotlib (such as with color parameters) suggest that adding specific checks for `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` is in line with the overall design philosophy of the library.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context and Potential Resolution:**\n\nTo move towards resolving the issue, it would be beneficial to dive deeper into how `scatter` is implemented within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`, as this file likely contains the core logic relevant to the problem. Specifically, seeing how the method differentiates or merges the handling of `linewidths` vs. `linewidth` and `edgecolors` vs. `edgecolor` would provide direct insight into where the proposed checks or warnings could be introduced. Additionally, examining any existing conditionals or validations around these parameters could offer a template or precedent for implementing the requested feature."

        "content": "1. **More Context Needed:**\n   - To address the issue effectively, it\u2019s crucial to analyze how the `scatter` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` handles the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` attributes specifically. Also, it would help to understand any existing logic for handling singular and plural kwargs to model the new checks or error messages after. Therefore, the following API call is necessary:\n     ```python\n     search_method_in_file(\"scatter\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     ```\n   - Additionally, to get an idea of how singular and plural forms are currently being processed or prioritized, a closer look at the code snippets where `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are directly referenced in the same file might be beneficial. This would help in forming a complete understanding of the existing logic:\n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"linewidths\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     search_code_in_file(\"edgecolors\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n     ```\n\n2. **Where Are Bug Locations:**\n   - Given the current context, it's clear that necessary modifications will likely be focused on:\n     - **Location 1**:\n       - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`\n       - **Class and Method:** Wherever the `scatter` method is defined.\n       - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be updated to include logic that checks if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` are passed. If both are found, an exception should be raised to inform the user about the incorrect usage. This preserves the existing functionality while providing a clear directive to avoid ambiguity. The check should be mindful not to disrupt any existing logic that allows for either singular or plural forms to be used independently in a backward-compatible manner.\n   \n   These adjustments address the main concern of the issue \u2014 the ambiguity and potential confusion arising from accepting both singular and plural forms without clear guidance or handling. By instituting a clear error when both forms are used, users are directed towards consistent usage, reducing complexity and potential errors in downstream libraries."
