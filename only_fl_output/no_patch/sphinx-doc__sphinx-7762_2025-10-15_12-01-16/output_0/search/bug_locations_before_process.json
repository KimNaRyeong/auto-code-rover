        "intended_behavior": "This method currently sets a hardcoded `Accept` header for the HTTP requests. The intended behavior here is to replace the hardcoded `Accept` header with a mechanism that allows for customizable HTTP headers. This can be implemented by firstly introducing a new configuration option (e.g., `linkcheck_http_headers`) in the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`). The `check_thread` method should then be updated to read this new configuration and apply it to the HTTP requests. The implementation must ensure that if the user does not specify any custom headers, the method defaults to the existing hardcoded value or possibly no `Accept` header at all, thus preserving backward compatibility and existing functionality for users who do not need custom headers. This approach allows users facing issues with specific servers (like the GitHub Actions badges mentioned in the issue) to specify the necessary headers to successfully check links without altering the behavior for other users."
