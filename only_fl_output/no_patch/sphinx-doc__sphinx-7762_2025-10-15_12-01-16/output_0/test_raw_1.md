To address the `ModuleNotFoundError` from the previous attempt, we will incorporate Python's built-in `urllib.request` library instead of relying on external modules such as `requests`. Below is the revised version of `reproducer.py`, which should not require additional dependencies beyond the standard library:

```python
import urllib.request

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_request_with_custom_headers():
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    # Customizing the HTTP 'Accept' and 'User-Agent' headers as mentioned in the issue description.
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
        'User-Agent': 'Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4'
    }
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=headers)
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
            # Asserting the response status code to be 200 OK
            assert response.status == 200, f"Expected status code 200, got {response.status}"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        make_request_with_custom_headers()
        print("Success: The issue is not present, or it has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # If AssertionError is caught, it means our assertion failed, 
        # we print the stacktrace and exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # Any unexpected exceptions will be caught here, stacktrace printed,
        # and script will exit with a non-zero code indicating failure.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```
This version uses `urllib.request` for HTTP requests and handles both the intended `AssertionError` when the issue is present (i.e., if the server does not return a `200 OK` response) and any unexpected exceptions that might occur. It retains the previous logic: customizing the `Accept` and `User-Agent` headers and asserting that the response code is `200`. If the assertion fails (meaning a `200 OK` response was not received), an `AssertionError` is raised, and the stack trace of the issue is printed. If the script exits with code `0`, it indicates that the issue is either absent or has been resolved.
