We'll also want to explore how Greek characters and possibly other special characters are handled within these functions. Here are the API calls that could provide us with the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the deprecated `mathematica` function to understand its implementation and how it correctly handled Greek characters.\n   - `search_method(\"mathematica\")`\n\n2. Search for the new `parse_mathematica` function to find its implementation and identify potential issues in parsing Greek characters.\n   - `search_method(\"parse_mathematica\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue may involve how the `parse_mathematica` function interacts with character encoding or the Python AST generation, it may also be helpful to look for parts of the code that specifically handle character parsing or AST creation.\n   - `search_code(\"SyntaxError: unable to create a single AST\")`\n\nThese searches will hopefully provide a detailed view of how both functions are implemented, highlight any differences in their approaches to parsing, and identify the cause of the issue with Greek characters."
