        "intended_behavior": "After ensuring that Greek characters and special symbols are accurately tokenized, the parse method (and possibly other methods it relies on for translating tokens to full form lists and then to SymPy expressions) may need adjustments. The intention is to ensure that once special characters are recognized, they are correctly mapped or handled through the translation rules or through dynamic translation logic. This might involve extending CORRESPONDENCES, REPLACEMENTS, and RULES to include cases for Greek characters or improving the logic that interprets these tokens within expressions to convert them accurately into SymPy syntax."
