Each function should be wrapped or annotated with a deprecation warning indicating the version of Django in which they will be removed. This includes guiding developers towards the recommended new functions or patterns to use for translation in Django.\n\n2. **Implement or Update Deprecation Warnings**: Accompanying the marking of these functions as deprecated, the codebase should implement or update any deprecation warnings to notify users of the pending removal of these functions.\n\n    - Intended behavior: When these deprecated functions are used within the Django project or by Django applications, a deprecation warning should be logged. This warning should advise on the new preferred method(s), such as using `gettext()` and similar functions from the same `django.utils.translation` module.\n\nWithout the precise locations, we must infer the necessary actions based on the practice of deprecating functionality within a large codebase like Django. The actions are geared towards preserving existing functionality while preparing developers for upcoming changes in a future Django version.\n\nGiven the inability to locate the methods directly with the initial API calls and the absence of context for making further refined search calls, the next step would be manual investigation within the suspected modules (`django.utils.translation`) or consulting the Django deprecation timeline and related documentation for guidance."

This module is central to Django's internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) capabilities, providing functions and utilities for translating text into different languages.\n\n2. **No Direct Findings of `deprecation warning`**: The inability to find explicit deprecation warnings suggests either that the specific text \"deprecation warning\" isn't used as is within the context of these methods' deprecation or that the deprecation notices need to be added as part of resolving this issue.\n\n**Analysis of the Collected Context**:\n- The broad usage of `django.utils.translation` throughout the codebase underscores the importance of a careful, informed approach to deprecating its functions. Any modifications need to maintain or enhance the clarity and functionality of Django's internationalization framework.\n- The overarching intention behind this issue is to formally deprecate legacy functions that have been superseded by Python 3's native string handling capabilities. Given Python 2's end of life, maintaining these backward compatibility functions is no longer necessary, and doing so may clutter the codebase and confuse developers.\n\n**Intended Behavior of Parts of the Code Related to the Issue**:\n- The code locations using `django.utils.translation` should transition from using legacy translation functions to their modern equivalents, such as replacing `ugettext()` with `gettext()`. This means either directly updating calls in Django's own code or marking the legacy functions as deprecated to advise developers to make similar updates in their own Django projects.\n- For the deprecation process itself, the intended behavior would be to add deprecation warnings to the legacy functions. These warnings would alert developers of the deprecated status when the functions are used, without breaking existing functionality. The warnings should provide clear guidance on the new best practices, recommending specific modern functions as replacements.\n\nGiven the lack of direct findings for deprecation warnings, the next steps would involve identifying the specific files and modules most relevant to these translation functions, particularly `django.utils.translation.__init__.py` and potentially `django/views/i18n.py`, as they might contain the actual functions or references to them. We would then add or enhance deprecation warnings within these areas.\n\nFurther, it would be critical to review documentation and ensure it guides developers towards the updated functions, highlighting the deprecated ones' status and the timeline for their removal."

The warning message should guide developers to use the new functions.\n\n2. **Related Documentation**\n    - **Location**: Anywhere in the Django documentation, particularly in sections detailing internationalization (i18n).\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Update the documentation to reflect these deprecations, providing guidance on the new functions to use and marking the legacy functions explicitly as deprecated. Include examples and maybe a migration guide to help developers transition their code.\n\nWhile we don't need to identify more contexts through API calls, the action steps involve both coding changes (adding deprecation warnings and possibly modifying internal uses of these functions within the Django codebase) and documentation updates. \n\nThis strategic approach ensures that:\n- Developers are clearly informed of the deprecations when using old functions.\n- The documentation guides developers towards the new best practices.\n- Existing functionality is preserved until the functions are removed in a designated future Django version, maintaining backward compatibility in the meantime."
