As other compatibility layers have been cleaned up, these shims can be deprecated for removal.\n</issue>"

Given these requirements, here's how we can proceed with the API calls:\n\n1. Search for each deprecated function in the entire codebase to understand their usage and the context in which they are defined. This will help in identifying files and classes where changes are required.\n2. Since these functions are related to translation, it's likely they are located in modules or classes that deal with translation. Still, without specific knowledge of their location, we'll start with a broad search.\n\nAPI calls:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"ugettext\")\nsearch_method(\"ugettext_lazy\")\nsearch_method(\"ugettext_noop\")\nsearch_method(\"ungettext\")\nsearch_method(\"ungettext_lazy\")\n``` \n\nThese calls will provide a broad overview of where these methods are used throughout the Django project, helping to map out the necessary changes."
