With this in mind, the Django code base can be cleaned up.\nFor additional details, see the Python 3.3 release notes:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-3151-reworking-the-os-and-io-exception-hierarchy\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between OSError, IOError, EnvironmentError, WindowsError, mmap.error, socket.error or select.error. All these exception types are now only one: OSError. The other names are kept as aliases for compatibility reasons.\nAdditionally, since Python 3.4, SMTPException is subclass of OSError . So exception handles catching both can be simplified to just OSError.\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPException\nSubclass of OSError that is the base exception class for all the other exceptions provided by this module.\nChanged in version 3.4: SMTPException became subclass of OSError\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can start piecing together how these exceptions are used across the Django codebase and understand the implications for fixing the issue. \n\n### Analyzing `IOError` occurrences\nOccurrences of `IOError` were found in various files, often related to file operations, request handling, translation mechanisms, static files handling, temporary files handling, and more. Given the broad usage across different components, the primary role of `IOError` here appears to handle exceptions arising from input/output operations, which is precisely what `OSError` in Python 3+ is designed to cover comprehensively.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\nReplacing `IOError` with `OSError` would simplify the exception handling by reducing the need to catch specific exceptions for different kinds of I/O errors that are all conceptually under the `OSError` umbrella in Python 3.3 and above.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Fix\nPost-replacement, any catch blocks for `IOError` would catch `OSError` instead, maintaining the same operational logic while adhering to the updated Python exception hierarchy.\n\n### Analyzing `EnvironmentError` occurrences\n`EnvironmentError` is specifically encountered in GIS-related parts of the codebase (`libgeos.py` and `libgdal.py`), which indicates its use for handling exceptions related to environmental issues, such as problems with library paths. The switch to `OSError` would not disrupt the logic since `EnvironmentError` was a base class for I/O-related errors, again streamlined under `OSError` in modern Python versions.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug and Intended Behavior\nSimilar to `IOError`, the intended post-fix behavior is for the code to leverage the broader `OSError` for capturing the same exceptions, ensuring the code is both cleaner and compliant with the current Python standards.\n\n### `WindowsError`, `mmap.error`, and `select.error` Searches\nThe search did not return results for `WindowsError`, `mmap.error`, and `select.error`, which could mean that either these exceptions are not used directly in the Django codebase or they are referred to in ways that the search query did not capture. Considering the project scale, it might be beneficial to confirm their absence or presence by inspecting common locations or functionalities where such exceptions might be expected (e.g., Windows-specific code paths for `WindowsError`).\n\n### Analyzing `socket.error` and `SMTPException` occurrences\n`socket.error` usages are tied to server management and email backend functionalities, which involves network operations, a prime area for `OSError` application. The `SMTPException` findings within `smtp.py` indicate a direct tie to email sending functionalities, where network-related errors are a primary concern.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug and Intended Behavior\nReplacing both `socket.error` and `SMTPException` with `OSError` aligns with the modern Python approach of handling such exceptions under a unified class, streamlining error handling in network operations and email functionalities within Django.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nFor each identified instance of outdated exception usage:\n- **Determine Context:** Understand the specific operations being performed (e.g., file handling, network communication).\n- **Plan Replacement:** Ensure replacing the exception does not alter the intended catch behavior, confirming that the broader `OSError` can indeed catch the errors previously caught by the more specific exceptions.\n\nGiven this analysis, targeted patches should be prepared for the identified files, replacing the outdated exception types with `OSError` and ensuring this change aligns with the intended error handling behavior for each context."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This change will handle exceptions related to issues such as reading and writing CSRF tokens to the underlying storage mechanism while preserving the existing functionality of CSRF middleware exception handling.\n\n- **Location 2:** \n  - **File:** django/contrib/gis/geos/libgeos.py\n  - **Function:** load_geos\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Replace `EnvironmentError` with `OSError` in the exception handling block. This ensures that any issues related to loading the GEOS library, such as file not found or access errors, remain effectively caught under the unified `OSError` class, keeping the geographic information system functionalities intact.\n\n- **Location 3:** \n  - **File:** django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py\n  - **Class:** EmailBackend\n  - **Method:** open\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Update the exception handling to replace `(smtplib.SMTPException, socket.error)` with just `OSError`. Since `SMTPException` is a subclass of `OSError` and `socket.error` is now an alias for `OSError`, this simplification will ensure that all SMTP connection-related errors are caught without altering the error handling logic for email backend connections.\n\n- **Location 4:** \n  - **File:** django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Substitute `socket.error` with `OSError` where applicable. This adjustment will cater to network issues that may arise during the server run-time, like port binding errors, ensuring the server command's robustness against such failures.\n\nEach of these locations has been identified based on the search results for the usage of outdated exception aliases. The intended behavior focuses on simplifying the exception hierarchy without affecting the functional aspects of the code. This approach will streamline the error handling in Django to better align with the Python 3 exception hierarchy, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable."
