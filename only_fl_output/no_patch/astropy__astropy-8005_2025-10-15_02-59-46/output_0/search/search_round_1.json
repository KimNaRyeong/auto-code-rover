This seems inconsistent, so can we try and make things more consistent for the 3.1 release? (I see this as bug-like, so I think it can be addressed after feature freeze).\nNote that this is related to https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8003 - if we change the default cosmology to Planck 2015, then we can change the ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to use the default cosmology without changing results (for now).\n</issue>"

However, the searches for the `default_cosmology.get` method and the `with_H0 equivalency` did not yield results, indicating a need for adjusting our approach to gather the necessary information.\n\n1. **Analysis of `Planck15.Tcmb0` usage**: \n   - The snippet from `astropy/units/equivalencies.py` reveals how the default value for `T_cmb` is obtained when it's not provided by the user; it directly uses `Planck15.Tcmb0`.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: This is directly related to the issue since it highlights the hardcoded use of the Planck 2015 (`Planck15`) cosmology for defining the thermodynamic temperature, which is described as inconsistent with the usage of the default cosmology elsewhere in the project.\n   - **Intended behavior**: To resolve the described inconsistency, this part of the code should ideally refer to the current default cosmology's `Tcmb0` value instead of hardcoding `Planck15`.\n\nGiven the failure to find references to `default_cosmology.get` and the `with_H0 equivalency`, it's necessary to expand our search to better understand how default cosmology values are utilized across the project and to confirm the current default cosmology setting. Here are the next steps in our approach:\n\n1. Adjust the search for the default cosmology getter method, considering the possibility of an incorrect method signature. We can search for the existence of the `default_cosmology` object or related methods in the codebase.\n2. Rephrase the search for the `with_H0 equivalency` considering it might not be directly referred to by that exact phrase in the code base. It's also possible that the functionality related to `H0` equivalency is integrated under a different name or in a broader context.\n3. Since the search for `default_cosmology.get` method did not return results, it could be beneficial to search more broadly for `default_cosmology` to catch how it\u2019s set or used elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the next set of API calls would be:\n\n- search_code(\"default_cosmology\")\n- search_code(\"H0 equivalency\")"

This change preserves the existing functionality by still providing a default cosmological temperature but ensures the source of this default value is consistent with the project's overall approach to cosmological defaults. The modification should include a fetch mechanism for the current default cosmology (similar to how the `H0` equivalency intended to work) and use its `Tcmb0` value if `T_cmb` is not provided by the user."
