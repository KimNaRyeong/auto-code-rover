        "intended_behavior": "The method or property that calculates `feature_importances_` should ensure that the importance values of all features are normalized in such a way that their sum equals 1.0 across all trees in the ensemble, regardless of the number of estimators or the depth of individual trees. This includes addressing any floating-point arithmetic issues that may cause inaccuracies as the number of estimators increases. This might involve revisiting the aggregation logic for feature importance across all trees, especially ensuring that no rounding errors or overflow/underflow issues diminish the sum with a large number of trees. Existing functionality should remain intact, meaning that the returned importances should still reflect the relative importance of each feature in the model's decision-making process, only ensuring their sum is correctly normalized."
