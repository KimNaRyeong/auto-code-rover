        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

It's the primary location where the bug might be originating, especially how feature importances are aggregated or normalized.\n    - **Intended behavior:** Given any number of estimators and depth, the sum of feature importances across all features should be 1. Any deviation might indicate incorrect aggregation or normalization.\n\n2. The fact that both `fit` method and `feature_importances_` property/method search within `GradientBoostingRegressor` returned no direct hits in the API calls suggests that:\n    - **What it implies:** `fit` and `feature_importances_` are possibly inherited or indirectly defined, making it complicated to locate their exact implementations without inspecting inheritance hierarchies or digging deeper into the base classes.\n    - **Relationship to the bug:** Understanding the implementation details of these components is crucial since the bug could be in how the ensemble of estimators is trained (`fit`) or how feature importances are calculated and normalized (`feature_importances_`).\n    - **Intended behavior:** The `fit` method should correctly train the ensemble model, respecting the given parameters, and `feature_importances_` should accurately calculate and normalize importances to sum to 1 across all features.\n\n3. The search for `estimators_` and `feature_importances_` revealed multiple snippets across files including `gradient_boosting.py`, indicating widespread use of these attributes/methods:\n    - **What it does:** These references across different files suggest that both attributes are key components of ensemble models in scikit-learn, used for storing trained estimators and accessing their combined or individual feature importances.\n    - **Relationship to the bug:** The bug may lie in the way `feature_importances_` are computed, especially after a certain number of estimators are trained, or how estimators are accessed and their importances aggregated in `GradientBoostingRegressor`.\n    - **Intended behavior:** Independent of the number of estimators, accessing `feature_importances_` should provide a normalized importance score across all features, indicating their relative importance in the ensemble's decision-making.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Analysis\nGiven the current context, further steps should include direct examination of how `GradientBoostingRegressor` accesses and utilizes `estimators_` for calculating `feature_importances_`. Since direct search for `fit` and `feature_importances_` did not yield results within `GradientBoostingRegressor`, it might be worthwhile to:\n- Examine the inheritance of `GradientBoostingRegressor` to find where `fit` and `feature_importances_` are defined. Searches could be tailored towards base classes or mixins that are part of the `GradientBoostingRegressor` definition.\n- Specifically inspect the code in `gradient_boosting.py` around the snippets where `estimators_` and `feature_importances_` are mentioned to understand their implementation and usage context.\n  \nTo gain further insight into the underlying issue, the following API calls could be beneficial:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"compute_feature_importances\", \"sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py\")` to understand how feature importances are computed within the file where `GradientBoostingRegressor` is defined.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py\", [line where estimators_ are detailed], 10)` replacing `[line where estimators_ are detailed]` with actual line numbers from previous results to explore how estimators are handled specifically in this context.\n- Investigate base or related classes for the actual implementation of `fit` and detailed calculation of `feature_importances_`, requiring a look into parent classes or mixins via the documentation or source code directly."

This includes addressing any floating-point arithmetic issues that may cause inaccuracies as the number of estimators increases. This might involve revisiting the aggregation logic for feature importance across all trees, especially ensuring that no rounding errors or overflow/underflow issues diminish the sum with a large number of trees. Existing functionality should remain intact, meaning that the returned importances should still reflect the relative importance of each feature in the model's decision-making process, only ensuring their sum is correctly normalized.\n\nGiven the symptoms described in the issue, the bug's resolution revolves around ensuring numerical stability and accuracy in the calculation and normalization of feature importances within the `GradientBoostingRegressor`. This might not require changes to the fitting procedure itself but rather a careful review and potential adjustment of how feature importances are aggregated and normalized from the ensemble of decision trees that make up the gradient boosting model."
