        "content": "<issue>Feature request: vector cross product\nxarray currently has the `xarray.dot()` function for calculating arbitrary dot products which is indeed very handy.\nSometimes, especially for physical applications I also need a vector cross product. I' wondering whether you would be interested in having ` xarray.cross` as a wrapper of [`numpy.cross`.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cross.html) I currently use the following implementation:\n```python\ndef cross(a, b, spatial_dim, output_dtype=None):\n\"\"\"xarray-compatible cross product\nCompatible with dask, parallelization uses a.dtype as output_dtype\n\"\"\"\n# TODO find spatial dim default by looking for unique 3(or 2)-valued dim?\nfor d in (a, b):\nif spatial_dim not in d.dims:\nraise ValueError('dimension {} not in {}'.format(spatial_dim, d))\nif d.sizes[spatial_dim] != 3:  #TODO handle 2-valued cases\nraise ValueError('dimension {} has not length 3 in {}'.format(d))\nif output_dtype is None:\noutput_dtype = a.dtype  # TODO some better way to determine default?\nc = xr.apply_ufunc(np.cross, a, b,\ninput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim], [spatial_dim]],\noutput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim]],\ndask='parallelized', output_dtypes=[output_dtype]\n)\nreturn c\n```\n#### Example usage\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\na = xr.DataArray(np.empty((10, 3)), dims=['line', 'cartesian'])\nb = xr.full_like(a, 1)\nc = cross(a, b, 'cartesian')\n```\n#### Main question\nDo you want such a function (and possibly associated `DataArray.cross` methods) in the `xarray` namespace, or should it be in some other package?  I didn't find a package which would be a good fit as this is close to core numpy functionality and isn't as domain specific as some geo packages. I'm not aware of some \"xrphysics\" package.\nI could make a PR if you'd want to have it in `xarray` directly.\n#### Output of ``xr.show_versions()``\n<details>\n# Paste the output here xr.show_versions() here\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: None\npython: 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)\n[GCC 7.3.0]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Linux\nOS-release: 4.9.0-9-amd64\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor:\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_US.UTF-8\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\nlibhdf5: 1.10.4\nlibnetcdf: 4.6.1\nxarray: 0.12.3\npandas: 0.24.2\nnumpy: 1.16.4\nscipy: 1.3.0\nnetCDF4: 1.4.2\npydap: None\nh5netcdf: 0.7.4\nh5py: 2.9.0\nNio: None\nzarr: None\ncftime: 1.0.3.4\nnc_time_axis: None\nPseudoNetCDF: None\nrasterio: None\ncfgrib: None\niris: None\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\ndask: 2.1.0\ndistributed: 2.1.0\nmatplotlib: 3.1.0\ncartopy: None\nseaborn: 0.9.0\nnumbagg: None\nsetuptools: 41.0.1\npip: 19.1.1\nconda: 4.7.11\npytest: 5.0.1\nIPython: 7.6.1\nsphinx: 2.1.2\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Implementation of `dot` in xarray\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `dot` function implementations in `xarray` are designed to compute the dot product of two `DataArray` objects along their shared dimensions. The method in `xarray/core/dataarray.py` provides a high-level interface that relies on the underlying implementation in `xarray/core/computation.py`. It handles the input validation and forwards the computation to a more generic `dot` function which can operate on either `DataArray` or `Variable` objects. This generic function constructs the computation using numpy's `einsum` function as a backbone, allowing for a flexible specification of dimensions over which to sum.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- There's no bug per se, but the feature request is for a similar vector operation (cross product) to be implemented with similar flexibility and integration into the `xarray` ecosystem. The implementation of `dot` provides valuable insight into how xarray integrates numpy functions, especially handling of dimensions, and can serve as a guide for implementing the `cross` function.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n\n- The intended behavior would draw parallels to the `dot` function, allowing users to specify dimensions along which to compute the cross product of two `DataArray` objects. It would leverage numpy's `cross` function, akin to how the `dot` function leverages `einsum` and `tensordot`, and include handling for dask arrays.\n\n#### 2. Usage of `apply_ufunc` and `dask='parallelized'`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- `apply_ufunc` is a core utility in `xarray` that wraps the application of ufuncs (universal functions from numpy), enabling them to work on `xarray` objects such as `DataArray` and `DataSet`, with considerations for chunked dask arrays and dimension handling.\n\n- Instances in the code where `dask='parallelized'` is used with `apply_ufunc` indicate the use of dask for parallel execution. This suggests an approach for integrating operations that can benefit from parallel computation, especially for large datasets.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the issue?**\n\n- The initial implementation suggested in the issue uses `apply_ufunc` with `dask='parallelized'`, indicating the author's intent to align the new `cross` function with existing patterns for parallelized computation and integration into `xarray`. This functionality is crucial for ensuring the new `cross` function can be applied efficiently to large datasets, potentially leveraging dask's parallel computing capabilities.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n\n- Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be a seamless integration of numpy's `cross` function with `xarray`'s data structures, enabling users to compute cross products of arrays in a way that automatically handles dimensions correctly and supports parallel computation through dask.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proposed `cross` function should be designed following the patterns observed in the `dot` function's implementation, particularly:\n- Validating input dimensions and array lengths.\n- Using `apply_ufunc` to leverage numpy's `cross`, providing compatibility with xarray structures.\n- Incorporating dask support via the `dask='parallelized'` option for efficient computation on large datasets.\n\nThis approach ensures consistency with xarray's computational paradigms and offers the potential for high performance and usability."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

        "content": "1.\n\n2.\n- **Bug Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/computation.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This file should include a new `cross` function that mimics the structure and approach used by the existing `dot` function but instead employs `numpy.cross` to compute the cross product of two `DataArray` objects. The function should handle input validation (e.g., ensuring that the spatial dimension has a size of 3 for 3D vectors or 2 for 2D vectors), work with dask arrays (using `dask='parallelized'` when applicable), and respect xarray's dimension handling conventions. This new function will extend xarray's computational capabilities to include vector cross products, filling a gap for users working on physical applications requiring such operations.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/dataarray.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Add a new method `cross` to the `DataArray` class. This method would provide a high-level interface to the `cross` function defined in `computation.py`, allowing users to call the cross product operation directly on `DataArray` instances, similar to how they currently use the `dot` method. This method should validate the input and dimensions, similarly ensuring that only suitable `DataArray` objects are passed (e.g., checking that the spatial dimension is correctly sized and exists within the arrays). This extension will make the feature easily accessible to users, integrating seamlessly with the existing API.\n\nThe addition of these functionalities does not alter the existing functionality but rather extends the xarray library with new capabilities, following its existing design patterns and computational paradigms."
