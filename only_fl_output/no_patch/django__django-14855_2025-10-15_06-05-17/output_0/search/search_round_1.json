        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have several pieces of information that are critical for understanding the issue and planning a solution:\n\n### 1. `get_admin_url` Methods in the Codebase\nOur search indicates that there are methods named `get_admin_url` found within `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` and `django/contrib/admin/models.py`. The issue description points to a specific line in a `get_admin_url` method that generates a URL without considering the custom admin site's root path, which is crucial for ensuring links navigate correctly within a customized admin interface.\n\n### 2. `ModelAdmin` Class Analysis\nThe `ModelAdmin` class, defined in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, contains various methods that assist in rendering the admin pages for individual models, including list views, edit forms, and more. In particular, we looked at the `response_add` method to see how it handles the post-object-addition redirect within the admin interface. This method successfully uses the `current_app` parameter in `reverse` to ensure redirects honor the admin site's root name, which aligns with the suggested fix in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of Each Part:\n- **`get_admin_url` Issue and Context**: This method likely constructs URLs for objects within the admin site, especially for ForeignKey or related object links in readonly fields. The problem arises when it neglects the custom admin site's root, causing incorrect URL generation (`/admin/...` instead of `/custom-admin/...`).\n\n- **`ModelAdmin.response_add` Connection to Bug**: This method shows a correct implementation of URL generation post-object creation by acknowledging the admin site's custom root path (`current_app=self.admin_site.name`). It establishes that this pattern is not only feasible but already in use within Django admin's framework for similar redirect purposes.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: When generating URLs, especially in readonly fields that link to related objects within an admin interface, it is essential to respect the custom admin site's root path. The usage of the `current_app` parameter in `reverse` calls within the `ModelAdmin.response_add` method demonstrates the intended behavior, which needs to be applied to the `get_admin_url` method to fix the issue.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\nTo further address the issue, considering the result from the failed code search and what we've learned, additional API calls should:\n1. Focus on fetching the specific implementation details of `get_admin_url` within `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` to understand its current handling of URL generation.\n2. Investigate how the custom admin site's name is stored and accessed, since referencing it properly is crucial for the suggested fix (`current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`).\n\n### Recommended API Calls:\n1. To get a deeper understanding of how `get_admin_url` is implemented and possibly affected by the custom admin site settings:\n   \n   - `search_method_in_file(\"get_admin_url\", \"django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\")`\n\n2. To understand how the admin site's name is managed and can be correctly referenced in the context of `get_admin_url`, considering the method might not directly have access to `model_admin`:\n   \n   - `search_code_in_file(\"admin_site.name\", \"django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\")`\n   - This is speculative and assumes that there may be references or patterns in `helpers.py` that ensure the admin site's name is accessible for URL generation tasks.\n\nBy investigating these areas, we can gather crucial information for devising a patch that not only resolves the issue but also integrates smoothly with existing patterns in the Django admin framework."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This adjustment will ensure that when a `ForeignKey` field is displayed as a readonly field within the admin for a custom admin site, the generated URL will correctly prefix with the custom admin path (e.g., `/custom-admin/...`) instead of the default `/admin/...` path. \n\n  To achieve this intended behavior, the method should be modified to include the `current_app` parameter with the `reverse` function call, possibly as `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`, similar to how it's implemented in the `ModelAdmin.response_add` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This change would ensure that the generated URL respects the current admin site's context, thus preserving the navigational integrity within custom admin interfaces.\n\n  This approach assumes that `self.model_admin.admin_site.name` is accessible within the context where `get_admin_url` operates. If this assumption holds true, then incorporating the `current_app` parameter will align the functionality of `get_admin_url` with the intended behavior, seamlessly integrating with Django's admin URL routing scheme for both default and custom admin sites."
