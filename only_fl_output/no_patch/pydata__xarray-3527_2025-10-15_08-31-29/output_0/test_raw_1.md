This script is designed to specifically catch and signal the issue regarding the lack of a `quantile` method for `DatasetGroupBy` objects in xarray. It raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, clearly indicating the problem. If no error is raised that would mean the specific issue has been addressed, allowing the script to signal a potential resolution.
