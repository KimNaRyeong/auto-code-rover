        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, a new method, quantile, needs to be implemented within the DatasetGroupBy class. This method should mirror the functionality and signature of the quantile method in the DataArrayGroupBy class, with adjustments for handling dataset-wide operations. The key aspects of the intended behavior include: - The method should accept parameters similar to those of DataArrayGroupBy.quantile, including q (quantile to compute), dim (dimensions over which to compute the quantile), interpolation (method of interpolation), and keep_attrs (whether to keep the attributes of the original object). - It will compute the quantiles across each variable in the grouped dataset, applying the specified quantile operation individually to each variable. This requires iterating over each variable in the dataset, possibly leveraging the existing map method or a similar approach to apply the quantile computation to each group. - The method should handle edge cases and parameters (like multiple q values) gracefully, aggregating results in a way that mirrors the behavior seen in DataArrayGroupBy, but adjusted for the dataset context. This might include shaping the output dataset to include a new dimension for the quantiles if multiple quantiles are requested. - Return a new Dataset object that represents the quantile computations across the grouped dataset, maintaining consistency with the structure and expectations of xarray operations."
