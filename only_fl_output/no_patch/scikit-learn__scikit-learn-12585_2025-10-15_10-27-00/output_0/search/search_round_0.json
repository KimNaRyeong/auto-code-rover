I'd happily submit a PR if this change is desired.\n#### Versions\nsklearn: 0.20.0\n</issue>"

Review the implementation of `clone` method in sklearn's `base.py` file, as the issue description directly mentions this method and its behavior when cloning classes (not instances).\n2. Understand how `get_params` method is implemented or used within classes that are supposed to work with `clone`, as the error is related to `get_params` missing the `self` argument.\n\nGiven these requirements, I'll use the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"clone\", \"base.py\")` to investigate how `clone` is implemented in the `base.py` file.\n- `search_method(\"get_params\")` to see how and where `get_params` is defined or used in the context of sklearn's classes that can be cloned."
