I'd happily submit a PR if this change is desired.\n#### Versions\nsklearn: 0.20.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of the `clone` method in `sklearn/base.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `clone` function is designed to construct a new estimator with the same parameters as the original. It deeply copies an estimator without copying attached data, ensuring the new estimator has the same parameters but is unfitted. The function checks if the object to be cloned is a list, tuple, set, or frozenset, doing a recursive clone in such cases. If the object doesn't have a `get_params` method and `safe=True`, it raises a `TypeError`, enforcing that only scikit-learn estimators (or objects implementing `get_params`) can be safely cloned. For valid estimator objects, `clone` retrieves the parameters through `get_params(deep=False)`, clones each parameter, and then re-instantiates the object with the cloned parameters.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe submitted issue occurs when an attempt is made to clone an object (specifically a class rather than an instance of an estimator) that does not have the `get_params` instance method because it's not an instance but a class. The current implementation doesn't distinguish between class types and instance types beyond checking for the `get_params` method, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to call `get_params` on a type rather than an instance.\n\n#### The intended behavior\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for `clone` to handle estimator types (classes themselves, not instances) gracefully. This implies that when an estimator parameter is a class type, `clone` should recognize this scenario and either bypass the cloning for this parameter or handle it in a way that aligns with the cloning goal without causing a `TypeError`.\n\n### Analysis of the `get_params` usage\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `get_params` method is implemented across various scikit-learn classes to return the parameters for the estimator. It is a crucial part of scikit-learn's interface, enabling users to inspect, clone, and set parameters of estimators programmatically.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe error reported occurs because `clone` expects an object's `get_params` method to be callable, which isn't the case for a class type since it's looking for an instance method. The behavior seen in the stack trace directly relates to the absence of instance-specific behavior (`get_params` requiring `self`) when dealing with a class rather than an instance.\n\n#### The intended behavior\nThe objective would be modifying `clone` (or adjusting the design) to recognize and specially handle class parameters, meaning estimator types that don't yet have an instance. This could involve checking if the parameter is a class and, if so, handling it differently from instance parameters to still allow cloning of the wrapper object without requiring instantiation of the class parameters at the cloning step.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing the issue requires a nuanced change to `clone`, introducing logic to distinguish between class and instance parameters and then acting accordingly without breaking the current contracts and expectations around scikit-learn's `clone` function."

Bug Location:\n   - File: `sklearn/base.py`\n   - Method: `clone`\n\nIntended Behavior:\nTo resolve the issue, the `clone` method needs to be modified to not only check whether an object has the `get_params` method but also to discern if the `estimator` parameter is a class type (`type`) instead of an instance. This adjustment is crucial for supporting the cloning of objects that have parameters that are classes of estimators (not instances thereof) without causing a `TypeError`.\n\nThe modification should introduce a condition to effectively handle class types\u2014specifically, sklearn estimator classes. When the `clone` function encounters an estimator type (a class, not an instance), it should ideally recognize it and either bypass cloning for this particular parameter, or, if cloning is still desired, it should do so in a way that correctly handles the class without attempting to invoke `get_params` on it. One approach to achieve this without breaking existing functionality might involve:\n- Introducing a check to determine if `estimator` is a type object. This could be done using `isinstance(estimator, type)`.\n- If `estimator` is a type (class), then directly return the class without trying to clone its parameters, as classes don\u2019t have parameters in the same way instances do. Alternatively, the design could be adjusted to handle cloning of classes in a manner suited to the intended use case, possibly by defining a standard mechanism for cloning class parameters that are intended to be used as types within the sklearn framework.\n\nThe new logic must ensure that all existing use cases, where estimators are instances and not classes, continue to work without alteration, preserving the function's original capability to clone fitted and unfitted estimator instances correctly. This requires careful consideration to avoid introducing regressions in functionality for the typical use cases of the `clone` utility."
