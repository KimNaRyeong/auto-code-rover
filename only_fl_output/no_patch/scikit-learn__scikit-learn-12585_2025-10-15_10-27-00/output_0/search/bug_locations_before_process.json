        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the clone method needs to be modified to not only check whether an object has the get_params method but also to discern if the estimator parameter is a class type (type) instead of an instance. This adjustment is crucial for supporting the cloning of objects that have parameters that are classes of estimators (not instances thereof) without causing a TypeError.\n\nThe modification should introduce a condition to effectively handle class types\u2014specifically, sklearn estimator classes. When the clone function encounters an estimator type (a class, not an instance), it should ideally recognize it and either bypass cloning for this particular parameter, or, if cloning is still desired, it should do so in a way that correctly handles the class without attempting to invoke get_params on it. One approach to achieve this without breaking existing functionality might involve:\n- Introducing a check to determine if estimator is a type object. This could be done using isinstance(estimator, type).\n- If estimator is a type (class), then directly return the class without trying to clone its parameters, as classes don\u2019t have parameters in the same way instances do. Alternatively, the design could be adjusted to handle cloning of classes in a manner suited to the intended use case, possibly by defining a standard mechanism for cloning class parameters that are intended to be used as types within the sklearn framework.\n\nThe new logic must ensure that all existing use cases, where estimators are instances and not classes, continue to work without alteration, preserving the function's original capability to clone fitted and unfitted estimator instances correctly. This requires careful consideration to avoid introducing regressions in functionality for the typical use cases of the clone utility."
