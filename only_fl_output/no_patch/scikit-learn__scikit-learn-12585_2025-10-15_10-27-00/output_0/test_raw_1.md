Based on the instructions provided and the need to ensure that the script appropriately reproduces the reported issue, correcting the mistake in the previously provided approach, here's how the standalone python file `reproducer.py` should be structured. This script is explicitly designed to trigger the reported issue regarding `clone` failing for parameters that are estimator types, raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, and also incorporating proper exception handling and traceback printing.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb[:-1]:  # Exclude the call from this function itself
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}", line {line_number}', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    frame = tb[-1]  # The last frame to print
    print(f'  File "{frame.filename}", line {frame.lineno}, in {frame.name}', file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"    {frame.line.strip() if frame.line else 'Unknown'}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.base import clone
    try:
        # Attempt to clone an estimator with a class type parameter
        clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        print("No issue found. The script should only reach this print statement if the issue is fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        # An exception is expected here due to the reported issue
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError to indicate the test reproduces the issue
        raise AssertionError("The issue was reproduced.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # Catch the AssertionError to handle it as per requirements.
        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the script executed correctly and
        # the observed behavior matches the issue's description.
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Any other exception indicates a different problem or possibly that the original issue might no longer exist.
        print("An unexpected error occurred, which may indicate the original issue is fixed or has changed:", str(e))
        exit(1)
```

This script endeavors to explicitly replicate the described scenario whereby `clone` fails when called with an estimator type as a parameter rather than an instance of the estimator. If the `AssertionError` is raised, it means the script was successful in reproducing the issue. Conversely, reaching the "No issue found" print statement implies a change in behavior that may suggest the problem has been resolved.
