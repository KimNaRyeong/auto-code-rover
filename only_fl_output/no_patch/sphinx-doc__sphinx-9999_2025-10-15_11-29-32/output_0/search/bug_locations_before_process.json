        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that glossary terms are separated by a newline in the LaTeX output. The current implementation might be grouping terms too closely, lacking adequate space or newlines between entries. The fix should introduce a consistent newline or spacing approach after each term to align with the formatting seen in HTML outputs. This might involve adjusting the LaTeX commands used to ensure terms are visually separated while preserving the functionality for other output formats managed in the same file."
