Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. It's designed to programmatically generate a simple Sphinx project, including the minimal set of files required to demonstrate the described issue with LaTeX output. It then runs a Sphinx build targetting LaTeX to produce a PDF and analyzes the generated `.tex` file for the absence of expected newlines between glossary terms or sample terms, leading to an `AssertionError` if the issue is present as described.

This script primarily:
- Creates a minimal Sphinx project with a configuration (`conf.py`), a master document (`index.rst`), and a document for testing (`test.rst`).
- Writes content that should trigger the described LaTeX formatting issues into `test.rst`.
- Builds the project with Sphinx, requesting LaTeX output.
- Checks the generated `.tex` file for evidence of the problem (e.g., missing newlines where expected).
- Raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace if the output is incorrect.

Please note that for this script to work, Sphinx must be installed in the environment where this script is executed. The check in `check_tex_for_newlines` function is very basic and might need adjustments according to the specific output details of your LaTeX configuration and the precise formatting you're checking for.
