        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, we need to focus on how URL converters work within the routing mechanism, specifically the behavior of `to_url` and `_reverse_with_prefix` methods, as mentioned in the issue. The user is experiencing unexpected behavior when trying to dynamically select the correct named route based on the success of a URL converter's `to_url` method. They suggest that a `ValueError` thrown by `to_url` could be caught similarly to how it's done in `to_python`, or alternatively, the documentation should explain the intended handling for declining a match in `to_url`. \n\nLet's proceed with the following search API calls to collect related code and documentation:\n\n1. `search_method(\"to_url\")`: To identify where and how `to_url` is defined and used within the URL converter logic.\n2. `search_method(\"_reverse_with_prefix\")`: To inspect the implementation details of `_reverse_with_prefix`, where the issue suggests adding error handling could resolve the described behavior.\n3. `search_code(\"path('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export')\")`: To find the specific usage of path configurations related to the issue description.\n4. `search_code(\"raise ValueError\")`: To look for instances where `ValueError` is raised within URL converters or related routing logic.\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a clearer understanding of how the URL converter's `to_url` method is intended to signal a non-match, and how `_reverse_with_prefix` handles route selection based on the converters' outcomes. This context will be crucial for deciding whether the solution involves modifying the internal Django URL routing mechanism or updating the documentation to clarify expected behavior."
