        "intended_behavior": "When both `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`, the method should explicitly handle this scenario to make the behavior consistent between sparse and dense inputs. A potential fix could involve setting `self.mean_` and `self.scale_` to `None` or appropriate identity values to reflect the 'no operation' status. Moreover, it should correctly compute or reset `self.n_samples_seen_` to handle multiple `fit` calls without errors. For sparse inputs, the code should either not update these attributes when both flags are `False`, or do so in a manner consistent with dense inputs. This ensures that when users theoretically apply `transform`, it results in unchanged data. An informative warning could also be added to guide users towards `FunctionTransformer` for use cases seeking an identity operation. Adding checks or raising informative errors at the start of `fit` and `partial_fit` methods if both `with_mean` and `with_std` are `False`, suggesting the use of `FunctionTransformer` for scenarios where data transformation is not intended, could enhance clarity and user guidance."

This would prevent errors in successive calls to `fit` or `partial_fit` by ensuring these attributes are in a valid state post-reset, particularly addressing scenarios where `fit` is called multiple times with varying data structures (sparse vs. dense). This reset behavior must align with the intended use of `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`, ensuring these attributes don't inadvertently retain values from previous calls that conflict with these settings."
