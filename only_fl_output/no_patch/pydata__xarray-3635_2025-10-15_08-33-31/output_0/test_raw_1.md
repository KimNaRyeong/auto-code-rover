Given the feedback from your test execution and acknowledging the need to reproduce the reported issue with no misunderstanding in the requirements, below is the corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that should behave as requested: raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, and exit normally if the expected exception message is correct. This script now correctly interprets the quantile `q` value as a fraction, in the range `[0, 1]`, which is the correct usage when invoking `xarray.DataArray.quantile()`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])
        # Correct usage according to xarray convention, where q should be in the range [0, 1].
        da.quantile(q=0.5)
        print("Test executed successfully without raising an error. Issue appears to be fixed.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Percentiles must be in the range [0, 100]" in str(e):
            print("Original issue detected. Error message indicates quantiles are expected in the wrong range [0, 100].")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present, with the wrong error message.")
        elif "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]" in str(e):
            # This is the corrected behavior we would ideally want, if the test purpose was to check for an error.
            raise AssertionError("Error message correctly indicates [0, 1], but an error was not expected.")
        else:
            print("Unexpected error received. Exiting.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please replace the previous `reproducer.py` contents with the new version above. The script now directly addresses the range issue and checks for the correct range `[0, 1]` usage for the quantile method. It handles exceptions according to the described behavior and prints detailed information on failure cases.
