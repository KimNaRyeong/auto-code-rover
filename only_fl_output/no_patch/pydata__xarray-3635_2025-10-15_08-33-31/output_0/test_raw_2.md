This script is a corrected version focused on reproducing the specific issue described earlier, with the instruction to raise an `AssertionError` if the encountered issue matches the described incorrect exception message. Note that the Python environment where this script is executed should have the xarray package installed. The script uses the provided function `print_stacktrace` to print the stack trace upon catching an exception, which should aid in diagnosing the issue by providing clear line numbers and context for where the exception was raised.
