        "intended_behavior": "A new method should be added to the PrettyPrinter class specifically for handling the lerchphi function. This method should check for instances of the lerchphi function within the expressions being pretty-printed and format them into a readable, aesthetically pleasing ASCII art form. The method should capture and accurately represent the mathematical functionality of lerchphi, incorporating appropriate formatting rules to ensure that the pretty-printed output is both interpretable and consistent with SymPy's pretty printing standards for special functions. This task involves identifying the parameters of lerchphi and deciding on their representation in the output. The mechanism for identifying lerchphi functions within expressions and formatting them needs to be integrated seamlessly with the existing pretty printing processes, ensuring that it does not interfere with the rendering of other expressions or symbols that may be part of the input."
