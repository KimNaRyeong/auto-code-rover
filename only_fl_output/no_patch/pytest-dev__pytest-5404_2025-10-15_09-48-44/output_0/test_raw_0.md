Sure, I will write a `reproducer.py` that aims to replicate the reported issue, which is a `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` when attempting to import a module. Your provided function to print stack traces will be included to help identify where the issue occurs more clearly.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_import():
    try:
        # Attempt to import a module that's known to raise the KeyError under certain conditions
        from sty import fg
        return True
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert test_import(), "KeyError: '__wrapped__' issue detected."
    print("Test passed, no issue detected.")
```

This script attempts to reproduce the reported error by importing the `fg` module from `sty`, which was mentioned in the issue description. If the import raises a `KeyError` with `'__wrapped__'`, it will catch the exception and utilize your provided function to print a detailed stack trace. If no such error occurs (or if a different error occurs), the script will either pass (assertion succeeds) or print an unexpected error message.

To use this script, place it in the root directory of your project and execute it with Python 3 by running `python3 reproducerer.py` in your terminal. Remember, this script expects the issue to manifest exactly as described; if your environment, dependencies, or the nature of the bug differs, adjustments may be needed.
