As your request indicated, the previous attempt to reproduce the issue was not successful due to an unrelated error in the environment setup. Let's correct the approach with a revised `reproducer.py` script, considering the feedback. We aim to create a script that tests the specific issue of LaTeX rendering in plot labels when using `xarray`. We won't modify matplotlib's backend or introduce unrelated dependencies to focus on the core issue. Please ensure your environment has the necessary packages installed and is correctly set up for GUI operations if needed.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latex_rendering_in_xarray_plots():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr

    da = xr.DataArray(range(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=range(5)))
    latex_expression = r"$\frac{sin(x)}{x}$"
    da.x.attrs["long_name"] = latex_expression

    # Plot with xarray
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    da.plot(ax=ax)

    # Test if LaTeX expression is correctly passed to the plot
    # Note: This check purely verifies that our setup to reproduce the issue is correct,
    # i.e., the LaTeX string matches. It does NOT programmatically verify rendering.
    try:
        assert ax.get_xlabel() == latex_expression, "LaTeX expression was not correctly applied to xarray plot."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    finally:
        plt.close(fig)

    print("LaTeX expression correctly passed to plot. Rendering needs to be visually verified.")
    SystemExit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_latex_rendering_in_xarray_plots()
```

This script aims to isolate and confirm whether the issue of LaTeX rendering in `xarray` plots persists, focusing on whether the attribute carrying the LaTeX expression is correctly assigned to the plot's axis label. Remember, due to the nature of graphical output and rendering, some aspects (like how a LaTeX expression is rendered visually) may require manual verification beyond what can be programmatically checked in a non-interactive script environment.
