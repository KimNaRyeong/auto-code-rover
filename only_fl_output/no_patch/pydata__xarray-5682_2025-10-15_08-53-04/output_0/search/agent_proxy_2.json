Here are the identified bug locations and the intended behavior for each to resolve the issue:\n\n**Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** `xarray/plot/plot.py`\n- **Methods:** \n  - `line`\n  - `hist`\n  - `scatter`\n  - These methods were highlighted because of their use of `xlabel`, making them prime candidates for where the bug related to LaTeX rendering might manifest.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Each of these methods must ensure any `long_name` that includes LaTeX expressions is recognized and correctly formatted before being passed to matplotlib for plotting. This likely involves a check within each method to determine if the `long_name` is a LaTeX string (e.g., contains `$...$`) and ensuring that it is passed to matplotlib in a way that enables the LaTeX rendering, potentially by leveraging matplotlib's text handling capabilities explicitly for LaTeX.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- **File:** `xarray/plot/utils.py`\n- **Method:** `label_from_attrs`\n- **Intended Behavior:** This utility function should be enhanced to detect `long_name` values that are structured as LaTeX expressions. Upon detection, it should ensure that these values are formatted or flagged appropriately for LaTeX rendering by matplotlib. This could involve prepending `r'$...$'` if it's not already present (while being cautious not to double-wrap LaTeX strings) or utilizing any matplotlib utilities designed for LaTeX label handling. The change must preserve the handling of non-LaTeX `long_name`s as plain text.\n\nThe resolution involves ensuring consistency between the expected LaTeX handling within xarray and matplotlib's capabilities to render LaTeX expressions in plot labels. Care should be taken to avoid altering the handling of `long_name`s that do not contain LaTeX, preserving existing functionality."
