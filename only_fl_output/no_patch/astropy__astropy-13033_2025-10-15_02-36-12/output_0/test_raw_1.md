This revised script aims to fulfill the requirement of reproducing a specific issue within a Python script that is executed at the root directory of the project. It checks whether the issue regarding misleading exception messages in `TimeSeries` operations within the Astropy library is present. The script uses an `AssertionError` for conditions contrary to those expected to reproduce the issue, thereby ensuring it behaves correctly in signaling if the exact problem described is encountered (i.e., throwing a misleading exception when a required column is removed). The script exits with code 0 after successfully reproducing the issue or if the runtime conditions do not result in the expected misleading error message, implicitly indicating the problem has been resolved or the script did not correctly replicate the environment to trigger the issue.
