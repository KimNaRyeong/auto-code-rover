This script is designed to reproduce the described issue within the `astropy` project related to misleading exceptions when required columns are checked and found missing in a `TimeSeries` object. It attempts to alter a `TimeSeries` object in a way that would trigger the specified error condition. When the issue is present (i.e., the exception message is confusing or misleading), the script will capture and print the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. 

The usage of an `AssertionError` to check for the specific unexpected condition helps in ensuring that when the issue is addressed and the correct exception with the expected message is raised, the script would neither print the stack trace nor raise an assertion error, thereby indicating the issue has been fixed.
