        "intended_behavior": "For the `_contains` method, when dealing with a symbolic integer (e.g., `n` in the issue), the method should not attempt to perform direct truth evaluation on relational expressions. Instead, it should be capable of returning a symbolic expression that indicates the criteria for `n`'s membership in the range. This means adjusting the logic to handle the case where `n` is a `Symbol` and creating a return value that reflects the condition `n` must satisfy to be considered as contained within the range, without executing boolean logic that would trigger the `TypeError`. This adjustment will allow `intersect(FiniteSet(n))` to be evaluated symbolically, thus preserving the capability to work with symbolic mathematics, a core functionality of SymPy."
