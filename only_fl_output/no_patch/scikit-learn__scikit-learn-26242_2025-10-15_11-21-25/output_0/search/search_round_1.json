Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and considering the questions posed, we have several pieces of information and next steps to consider:\n\n1. **AdaBoostClassifier Class Definition**:\n   - We found the `AdaBoostClassifier` class in `sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py`. From its constructor (`__init__` method), we can observe the `base_estimator` parameter is set to `\"deprecated\"` by default, and an `estimator` parameter is introduced, reflecting the migration from `base_estimator` to `estimator`.\n   - This information is directly related to the bug as it highlights the transition and potential source of deprecation issues, particularly how `None` is handled or mishandled as a value.\n\n2. **Absence of `fit` Method in AdaBoostClassifier**:\n   - The `fit` method was not found directly within `AdaBoostClassifier`, implying it might be inherited from a parent class. The error trace from the issue provided involves `fit`, indicating the problem likely occurs within parameter validation that happens before or during the fitting process.\n   \n3. **Absence of `_validate_params` Method in AdaBoostClassifier**:\n   - Similarly, `_validate_params` was not found directly within `AdaBoostClassifier`, suggesting it's either located in a base class or uses a different mechanism for parameter validation.\n\n4. **validate_parameter_constraints in the Codebase**:\n   - Since `validate_parameter_constraints` appears in both `sklearn/base.py` and `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py`, with multiple matches, this function is crucial for parameter validation across the scikit-learn project. The error traceback pointed exactly to this function as the source of the `InvalidParameterError` for `base_estimator`.\n\nGiven these observations and the issue description, the intended behavior we need to correct is:\n- Enhancing the `validate_parameter_constraints` or the mechanism that delegates to this function, to accept `None` as a valid value for `base_estimator` or ensure that it gets correctly translated or treated within the context of deprecating `base_estimator` in favor of `estimator`.\n\nNext steps to further clarify ambiguities and guide towards a resolution could involve:\n- Searching for the `fit` method in base classes of `AdaBoostClassifier` to understand how it uses `base_estimator` or `estimator`.\n- Investigating `validate_parameter_constraints` more closely within `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` and `sklearn/base.py`, focusing on its implementation and how it is called, especially how it interacts with `base_estimator`.\n\nTo do this, the following API calls could be useful:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\")`: Since `fit` might be inherited or indirectly utilized, searching the same file as `AdaBoostClassifier` could give us more insight.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"validate_parameter_constraints\", \"sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\")`: To get specific implementation details.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"validate_parameter_constraints\", \"sklearn/base.py\")`: To understand how it's used in conjunction with class inheritance and parameter validation."

This involves adding a condition to treat `None` as an acceptable value when validating `base_estimator`, ensuring that it does not raise an `InvalidParameterError` when `base_estimator=None` is explicitly passed by the user. This change should be carefully handled to ensure that it only affects `AdaBoostClassifier` or wherever applicable based on the deprecation policy of `base_estimator`, preserving the function's current validation capabilities for other cases and parameters.\n\n   - Location 2: File: sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py, Class: AdaBoostClassifier\n     - Intended Behavior: In the context of deprecating `base_estimator` in favor of `estimator`, ensure that the class's initialization and any method using `base_estimator` (directly or through inheritance) correctly handle `None` as an explicitly set value, potentially by redirecting or defaulting to the new `estimator` parameter. Although we haven't identified a specific method here due to limitations in the provided context, the class definition or any relevant inherited method that deals with `base_estimator` should gracefully transition to the new `estimator` parameter, providing a backward-compatible way for handling `None`. This may involve implementing a new method within the class to check the parameter's value and manage its deprecation warning or error message accordingly."
