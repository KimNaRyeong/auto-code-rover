To address the issue you've encountered, we need to revise our approach to ensure that the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` correctly reproduces the specific issue with 301 redirect handling when using an older version of the `requests` library in conjunction with specific versions of `cryptography`, `ndg-httpsclient`, `pyOpenSSL`, and `pyasn1` under a Python 3 environment. Here's how you could structure such a file:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    try:
        # Make a request that should result in a 301 redirect
        response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301', timeout=5)
        
        # Typically, you'd check the final URL or status code here. However, since we are interested in
        # reproducing a specific error, we'll assume success if no exception is raised.
        print("Request completed successfully, no issue detected with redirects.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issue_detected = not check_issue()
    assert not issue_detected, "The issue is still present, check the stack trace above."
    if not issue_detected:
        # Exit with code 0 to indicate the absence of the issue or successful handling.
        import sys
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script is designed with the intention of reproducing the specific issue related to handling 301 redirects with an older setup of related Python libraries under a Python 3 environment. If the issue is present, the script will catch an exception, print the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and assert failure. If the issue is not present (either because it has been fixed or due to the environment not being affected by it), the script will complete without error, and exit with code 0.

It's important to adjust your environment to match the specific versions mentioned in the initial problem description to accurately reproduce the issue, as behavior may vary significantly with different versions of `requests` and its dependencies.
