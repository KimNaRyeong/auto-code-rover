I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.\nI Wrote this test:\n```\ndef test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):\nrequests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')\n```\nand this is the result of py.test:\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = <OpenSSL.SSL.Connection object at 0x000000000345CC50>\nbuf = u'GET /redirect/1 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: httpbin.org\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, defl...cept: */*\\r\\nUser-Agent: python-r\nequests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Windows/8\\r\\n\\r\\n'\nflags = 0\ndef sendall(self, buf, flags=0):\n\"\"\"\nSend \"all\" data on the connection.

The issue description points to a problem occurring when the URL, after being decoded, is passed on to `resolve_redirects`, implying this method might call or interact with urllib3 in a way that ends up passing Unicode strings to pyOpenSSL. We need more context about `resolve_redirects`:\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"resolve_redirects\")`\n\n3. Given that pyOpenSSL raises a TypeError about expecting byte strings but receives a Unicode string instead, there's an evident need for understanding the data flow into pyOpenSSL. We should look into how `sendall` is invoked with urllib3 and pyOpenSSL:\n   - `search_method_in_class(method_name=\"sendall\", class_name=\"Connection\")`\n   - Since the problem involves a type check, it would be useful to see how `buf` is handled before it reaches `sendall`:\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"if isinstance(buf, _memoryview):\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a detailed view into how redirects and HTTP methods interact across these libraries, pinpoint where Unicode strings might erroneously be passed around instead of byte strings, and clarify the handling of HTTP request bodies within the SSL connection establishment."

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze the results:\n\n### Analysis of `requests/adapters.py` Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippet from `requests/adapters.py` shows part of the `build_response` method in the `HTTPAdapter` class. It handles the decoding of the URL from bytes to a Unicode string if the URL is initially in bytes format. This allows the `response.url` to be uniformly represented as a Unicode string, irrespective of its original format.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This section is directly related to the issue since the process of converting the URL to a Unicode string is mentioned as a possible source of the error when handling a 301 redirect. The issue arises because a Unicode URL is eventually passed down to pyOpenSSL via urllib3, which expects bytes, not a Unicode string, hence raising a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to ensure that the URL is correctly formatted as a Unicode string for internal processing within `requests`. However, it must also ensure compatibility with lower-level libraries (like urllib3 and pyOpenSSL) that require the URL to be in bytes format when making actual HTTP requests, especially SSL/TLS requests.\n\n### Analysis of `requests/sessions.py` Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This segment from `requests/sessions.py` outlines the `resolve_redirects` method, which is responsible for handling HTTP redirects. When a response contains a `Location` header with a redirect status code, this method prepares a new request to follow the redirect. It does so by updating the request's URL and method as necessary, depending on the status code and the `Location` header value.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the bug involves an error when following a `301` redirect, `resolve_redirects` is central to understanding the issue. It's in this process of redirection where the URL, now as a Unicode string, is passed along until it reaches pyOpenSSL, which triggers the error. \n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to transparently handle redirects by making subsequent requests until the final resource is reached or until a limit is reached. It should handle URLs correctly, keeping in mind the expectations of all layers in the request-making process, including encoding requirements.\n\n### On Not Finding `Connection` Class and `_memoryview` Handling Code\n\nSince the `Connection` class and the specific handling of `_memoryview` weren't found, it appears this code belongs to the `pyOpenSSL` library rather than `requests` or `urllib3`. This suggests exploring the direct integration points between `requests`/`urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL` might provide insights into the issue. \n\n### Further Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, further steps could include exploring:\n- How `urllib3` uses `pyOpenSSL` for making HTTPS requests, particularly how URLs are handled and passed.\n- The exact integration point in `urllib3` that invokes `pyOpenSSL`, possibly by looking into `urllib3`'s SSL connection setup code.\n\nConsequently, additional API calls could target:\n- Searching for where `requests` or `urllib3` handle SSL connections setup to see if there's a specific passing of URLs to `pyOpenSSL`.\n- Investigating how `urllib3` integrates with `pyOpenSSL` (this might require looking into the `urllib3` codebase directly or searching for method invocations relevant to establishing SSL connections)."

The conversion to bytes should be conditionally applied based on whether the subsequent request layer expects a byte string. This preserves the existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with pyOpenSSL's expectations.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `requests/sessions.py`\n   - **Method:** `resolve_redirects`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** While the main issue doesn't directly lie within this function, ensuring that URLs are correctly formatted before they are passed to `send()` (which eventually leads to pyOpenSSL) might necessitate some form of intervention here. Before redirecting, if a URL is detected to potentially lead to an HTTPS request, ensure any necessary encoding is applied to maintain the URL as bytes if the subsequent handlers (like urlopen in urllib3 that eventually uses pyOpenSSL) require it. This might involve applying a similar check or conversion logic as suggested for `HTTPAdapter.build_response`, specifically tailored to handle cases where redirects involve URLs that must be byte-encoded."
