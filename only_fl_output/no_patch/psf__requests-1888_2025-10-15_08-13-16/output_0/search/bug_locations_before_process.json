The conversion to bytes should be conditionally applied based on whether the subsequent request layer expects a byte string. This preserves the existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with pyOpenSSL's expectations."

        "intended_behavior": "While the main issue doesn't directly lie within this function, ensuring that URLs are correctly formatted before they are passed to send() (which eventually leads to pyOpenSSL) might necessitate some form of intervention here. Before redirecting, if a URL is detected to potentially lead to an HTTPS request, ensure any necessary encoding is applied to maintain the URL as bytes if the subsequent handlers (like urlopen in urllib3 that eventually uses pyOpenSSL) require it. This might involve applying a similar check or conversion logic as suggested for HTTPAdapter.build_response, specifically tailored to handle cases where redirects involve URLs that must be byte-encoded."
