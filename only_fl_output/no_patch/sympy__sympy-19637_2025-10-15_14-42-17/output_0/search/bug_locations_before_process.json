        "intended_behavior": "The `kernS` method is intended to modify a string representing a mathematical expression to prevent auto-simplification when converted into a SymPy expression object. The bug specifically arises due to the `kern` variable being used before it has definitely been assigned a value in all execution paths of the method. To resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality, the method should be adjusted to ensure that `kern` is only referenced after it has been guaranteed to be assigned."
