        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: use new style format strings for colorbar ticks\n### Problem\nAt the moment, the default format strings in colorbar are old style ones, as in their init there is:\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L489-L492\nwhich is a different convention from the one of a normal axis, which was introduced in #16715.\n### Proposed solution\nAs in `update_ticks` we pass the colorbar's formatter to the long axis,\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L801\nthe `if` statement above may be removed to keep the default logic only in `Axis`. Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the use of new style format strings for colorbar ticks in Matplotlib, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. Get the context around the default format strings in `colorbar` by looking at the relevant lines in the `colorbar.py` file.\n```python\nget_code_around_line('lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py', 489, 5)\n```\n\n2. Understand how `update_ticks` method works and its interaction with the colorbar's formatter by investigating the method in the `colorbar.py` file.\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file('update_ticks', 'lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py')\n```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a change related to `Axis._set_formatter`, get context about this method as well.\n```python\nsearch_method('_set_formatter')\n```\n\n4. There's also a reference to a behavior introduced in a previous issue (#16715). While we may not be able to directly search for the issue, understanding how string formats are currently checked or handled in the `Axis` class might provide insights. Therefore, looking for string formatting or formatter related code in the `Axis` class might be helpful.\n```python\nsearch_class('Axis')\n```"
