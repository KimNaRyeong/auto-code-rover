Taking this into consideration, the adjusted script is structured to ensure that the Django setup is performed correctly with minimal configuration, suitable for a standalone script execution context.\n\nHere's an updated version of `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n\n# Configure Django for standalone script usage\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'db.sqlite3'),\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=(\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n    ),\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Chr\nfrom django.db.models import Value\n\n# Define a simple model to use for the test\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef reproduce_issue():\n    try:\n        # Mimic the operation that's causing issues\n        TestModel.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value(77)))\n        print(\"Issue is fixed, ValueError was not raised as expected.\")\n        return True\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return False\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if not reproduce_issue():\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the issue is reproduced\n    else:\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if the issue does not occur\n```\n\nThis script sets up Django to run in a standalone mode with an in-memory SQLite database, thus avoiding the `AppRegistryNotReady` error by calling `django.setup()` after configuring the settings but before using any of Django's components that require the framework to be fully initialized. It tries to reproduce the specified issue by performing the operation that has caused the error and handles both the reproduction and the potential absence (fix) of the problem as described."
