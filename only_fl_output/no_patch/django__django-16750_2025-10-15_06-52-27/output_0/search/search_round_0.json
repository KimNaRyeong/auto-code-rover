        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how `Chr` is implemented within the Django project, particularly its interaction with database expressions and how it handles the `output_field`. Given the traceback provided, we're particularly interested in the `Chr` class and potentially the `Value` class (as it's part of the expression that led to the error). Since the error occurs in `expressions.py`, we may need to review the implementation of `Chr` to see how it's designed to handle integer values and whether specifying an `output_field` could resolve the issue.\n\nI would start with the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Chr\")` - To find the definition(s) of the `Chr` class within the project. This will help us understand how it's currently implemented and if it already has an `output_field` defined or not.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"as_sql\", \"Chr\")` - Since the issue seems to be related to how `Chr` generates SQL, looking at the `as_sql` method (if it exists for the `Chr` class) could provide insights into how the output field could be affecting the generation of the SQL statement.\n3. `search_code(\"output_field =\")` - This will help in finding instances where `output_field` is defined or modified across the project to understand how it's typically used, especially in relation to database expressions like `Chr`.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point for understanding the problem and considering the proposed solution of setting `output_field = CharField()` within the `Chr` expression."
