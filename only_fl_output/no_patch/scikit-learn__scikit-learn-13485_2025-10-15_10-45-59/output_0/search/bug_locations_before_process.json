        "intended_behavior": "Modify the call to check_array within this method to allow 3D input arrays. This could be achieved by adjusting the parameters passed to check_array, making ensure_2d=False and allow_nd=True. This change would enable CalibratedClassifierCV to accept 3D inputs by being more flexible with the input shape, aligning with the behavior of other meta-estimators like GridSearchCV. It's crucial that this modification preserves existing functionality for 2D inputs to ensure that the utility of CalibratedClassifierCV isn't diminished for use cases that already work. This might involve checking the dimensionality of the input and conditionally setting these parameters so that 2D inputs are still handled as they are currently, while also supporting 3D inputs where necessary."
