        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method should include logic to correctly handle empty querysets. When `Exists` is applied with an empty queryset, especially in negated form (using `~`), it should still contribute to generating the correct SQL `WHERE` clause without leading to an `EmptyResultSet`. This means ensuring that the SQL construction process accounts for empty querysets in a way that preserves the expected logical behavior of the `Exists` condition. Specifically, for an empty queryset, the `EXISTS` statement should translate to a condition that evaluates to false when not negated and true when negated, ensuring the `WHERE` block is retained in the SQL query."

        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that when compiling a query, the `elide_empty` flag does not lead to the unintentional removal of essential parts of the SQL query, such as the `WHERE` clause, simply because a part of the query involves an empty queryset. It should make a distinction between genuinely unnecessary parts of a query (like an empty `WHERE` clause that has no conditions) and parts that are critical for the logic of the query to be correct, such as conditions derived from empty `Exists` subqueries. This may involve refining the logic that decides what parts of a query are elided to better account for the logical implications of those parts on the overall query."
