        "content": "<issue>convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively address the reported issue, it's crucial to gain an understanding of how the `convert_to` method is implemented and interacts with unit objects like joules and seconds. Since the issue revolves around potential mishandling or unexpected behavior in unit conversions, we should start by exploring the implementation details of the `convert_to` function, and also look into the classes representing units such as joules and seconds if they are distinctly implemented.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"convert_to\")` - This will help us locate the `convert_to` method within the project, which is central to the issue.\n2. `search_class(\"Joule\")` and `search_class(\"Second\")`- It's important to understand how the units mentioned in the issue (joules and seconds) are defined or referenced within the project. This information can be critical for tracing how unit conversions are processed.\n3. `search_code(\"joule*second\")` - Searching for code snippets that might be directly using or referring to the conversion operation involving joules and seconds could provide insight into how such conversions are handled or expected to be handled across the project."
