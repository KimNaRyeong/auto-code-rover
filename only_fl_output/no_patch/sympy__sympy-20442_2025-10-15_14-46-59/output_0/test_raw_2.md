Let's revise the `reproducer.py` script to correctly import and utilize the necessary functions from SymPy, addressing the import issue encountered previously. This version ensures that everything required for demonstrating the reported behavior is correctly imported and used within the script.

```python
from sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joules, s
from sympy import symbols

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_convert_to_issue():
    # Correcting the units to use `joules` and conversion format
    J = joules
    try:
        # Attempt conversion as stated in the issue
        result = convert_to(J * s, J)
        # We check specifically for the reported incorrect behavior
        expected_behavior = J * s
        if result != expected_behavior:
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected {expected_behavior}, got {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with the error code to indicate failure
    
    # If the script reaches this point, it means the issue is not present or has been fixed
    print("Issue not present or has been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_convert_to_issue()
```

This script attempts to correctly reproduce the issue initially reported with SymPy's `convert_to` function not handling conversions between units as expected. It uses the `joules` unit directly from the `sympy.physics.units` module and ensures that any failure in the expected behavior triggers an `AssertionError`, with a detailed stack trace of the issue printed to the standard error. This should help in verifying whether the issue persists or has been addressed in the currently installed version of SymPy.
