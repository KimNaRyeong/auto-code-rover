        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nconvert_to seems to combine orthogonal units\nTested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.\r\nSimple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"

The script is designed to trigger an `AssertionError` when the unusual behavior of `convert_to` from the `sympy` library (version 1.4 as specified) is observed, indicating the presence of the reported issue.

The precision of the conversion and the specific unexpected output (`joule**(7/9)`) are used as criteria to check whether the issue is present. The use of `assert` statement ensures that any deviation from the expected or corrected behavior is caught, and the script uses the `print_stacktrace` function to provide detailed error information before exiting.\n"
