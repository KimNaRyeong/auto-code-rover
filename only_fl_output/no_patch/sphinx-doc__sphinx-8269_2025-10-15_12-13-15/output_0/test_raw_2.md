Given the requirements and the constraints of the environment, let's attempt a different approach that directly calls the Sphinx build process programmatically and checks the generated linkcheck output to validate whether the issue is present. This script aims to mock the behavior of `sphinx-quickstart` in terms of creating a basic Sphinx project setup and then running a linkcheck to identify if the HTTP error is being incorrectly reported as an anchor error.

This script will create a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically, avoiding the dependency on a working environment command like `sphinx-quickstart` or external shell commands. It represents a full Python standalone script able to be executed in environments where Sphinx and its dependencies are correctly installed.

Make sure `sphinx` and its dependencies are properly installed in your environment. If `docutils` is not present (as seen from the previous error), you should install it using `pip install sphinx docutils` before running this script.

```python
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Create minimal Sphinx config and index files
    os.makedirs('source', exist_ok=True)
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.writelines([
            "project = 'proj'\n",
            "author = 'me'\n",
            "release = '1.0'\n",
            "language = 'en'\n",
            "extensions = []\n",
            "master_doc = 'index'\n",
            "exclude_patterns = ['_build']\n",
            "html_theme = 'alabaster'\n",
            # Enable anchor checking
            "linkcheck_anchors = True\n"
        ])
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write('Welcome to proj\'s documentation!\n')
        index_file.write('==================================\n\n')
        # Insert a broken link with an anchor
        index_file.write('.. _`my_anchor`:\n\n')
        index_file.write('`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_\n')

def run_linkcheck():
    # Run Sphinx build in linkcheck mode
    app = Sphinx(
        srcdir='source',
        confdir='source',
        outdir='build',
        doctreedir='build/doctrees',
        buildername='linkcheck'
    )
    app.build(force_all=True)
    with open(os.path.join('build', 'output.txt'), encoding='utf-8') as f:
        return f.read()

def main():
    setup_sphinx_project()
    try:
        output = run_linkcheck()
        # Check if output correctly reports HTTP error instead of anchor not found
        if "Anchor 'test' not found" in output:
            raise AssertionError("Incorrectly reported anchor not found instead of HTTP error")
        elif "404 Client Error: Not Found for url" in output:
            print("Issue is FIXED.")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Did not find the expected output")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this script:
- If the issue is present, it will print the stack trace showing where the assertion failed, indicating the problem still exists.
- If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0, printing "Issue is FIXED."

This script directly interacts with the Sphinx API for creating a project, configuring it, inserting a test document with a broken link, and running the linkcheck builder. It is designed to assert the core of the reported issue—how Sphinx linkcheck reports HTTP errors versus anchor not found errors—without needing to manipulate the surrounding tooling or environment explicitly.
