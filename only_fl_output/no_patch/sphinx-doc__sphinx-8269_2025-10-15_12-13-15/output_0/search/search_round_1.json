        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, I will gather more details about the implementation of the `linkcheck` functionality in Sphinx, focusing on how it differentiates between anchor errors and HTTP errors. Specifically, I will look for:\n\n- The class or method responsible for the `linkcheck` command execution.\n- How the tool checks for anchors in URLs and distinguishes between different types of errors (like a 404 HTTP error versus an anchor not found).\n- Configuration handling, specifically how the `linkcheck_anchors` setting toggles the behavior.\n\nGiven these requirements, I will start with the following API calls to locate the relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase:\n\n1. **Search for the command or method handling `linkcheck`:** Since `linkcheck` is a specific command in Sphinx, it's possible it's handled by a method or class dedicated to link checking within the project documentation.\n\n   ```\n   search_method(\"linkcheck\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for configuration handling related to `linkcheck_anchors`:** Understanding how the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration is used within the Sphinx project will be crucial to addressing the issue. This setting influences how anchors in URLs are validated, so finding where and how this setting is read will be important.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")\n   ``` \n\nThese initial searches should provide a solid starting point for understanding how Sphinx handles link checking, specifically in relation to HTTP errors and anchor validation, and will guide further investigation and code patching efforts."

        "content": "Given the outcomes from the initial search attempts:\n\n1. **No direct results for a method named `linkcheck`:** This indicates that the functionality related to the `linkcheck` command might not be encapsulated within a method that's plainly named `linkcheck`. Therefore, it's likely handled within a class or a differently named method that's part of the link checking process or pipeline within Sphinx. Considering Sphinx's architecture, it's also possible that the command triggers a series of actions spread across multiple methods or modules, rather than being contained within a single method.\n\n2. **`linkcheck_anchors` found in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`:** This result is significant for several reasons:\n   - **What does this part of the code do?** The presence of `linkcheck_anchors` in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` suggests that this file contains logic relevant to configuring and executing link checks, which includes handling anchors in URLs. It's likely where the tool determines how to process URLs and respond to different types of errors encountered during link verification.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Since the bug involves the tool incorrectly reporting anchor not found errors instead of HTTP errors when `linkcheck_anchors` is true, the handling (or mishandling) of this scenario is likely to be governed by logic within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`. The distinction between anchor errors and HTTP errors, and the decision-making process based on `linkcheck_anchors`, is central to this issue.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, the code should check the HTTP status code of a response before checking for the presence of an anchor. If an HTTP error is detected (e.g., 404, 500), it should report the HTTP error directly instead of or prior to checking/reporting an anchor error. This ensures that the actual availability of the link is addressed before its content.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step is to examine the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file to understand how it implements the link checking functionality and how it interacts with the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration. This requires a deeper look into the code to identify how errors are classified and reported during the link checking process. Specifically, we should:\n\n- Investigate the code structure and logic within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`, focusing on how HTTP responses are handled.\n- Look for method(s) that process link checks and determine error reporting based on response codes and anchor presence.\n\nTo proceed, I'll make the following API calls:\n\n1. **Inspect the file for error handling logic and the use of `linkcheck_anchors`:**\n   \n   ```\n   search_code_in_file(\"linkcheck_anchors\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Find methods in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` related to handling HTTP responses and anchor checking:**\n\n   ```\n   search_code_in_file(\"HTTP\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")\n   ``` \n\nThese calls aim to reveal relevant sections of the code that are responsible for identifying, classifying, and reporting different types of link errors, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

However, the bug is likely to be located in the section of code that interprets HTTP responses and decides whether to report an HTTP error or an anchor not found error.\n\n   **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The code in this location should first check the HTTP status code of each response when the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration is enabled. If the response is an error (e.g., 404, 500), it should report this HTTP error directly, instead of (or before) attempting to verify the existence of an anchor in the linked document. This behavior respects the user's expectation by accurately reporting the nature of the link's failure.\n   - To preserve the existing functionality while correcting the reported issue, the fix should ensure that when `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`, the tool still attempts to verify anchors but prioritizes the reporting of HTTP errors when they occur. \n   - This might involve modifying the logic that handles the response from each link check to first evaluate the HTTP status code, then, only if the status code indicates success (e.g., 200 OK), proceed to check for the specified anchor. This approach would address both aspects: it would accurately report when a document is not reachable due to an HTTP error, and it would also retain the capability to verify the existence of anchors in documents that are successfully retrieved."
