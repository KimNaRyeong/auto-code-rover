However, the bug is likely to be located in the section of code that interprets HTTP responses and decides whether to report an HTTP error or an anchor not found error.\n\n   **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The code in this location should first check the HTTP status code of each response when the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration is enabled. If the response is an error (e.g., 404, 500), it should report this HTTP error directly, instead of (or before) attempting to verify the existence of an anchor in the linked document. This behavior respects the user's expectation by accurately reporting the nature of the link's failure.\n   - To preserve the existing functionality while correcting the reported issue, the fix should ensure that when `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`, the tool still attempts to verify anchors but prioritizes the reporting of HTTP errors when they occur. \n   - This might involve modifying the logic that handles the response from each link check to first evaluate the HTTP status code, then, only if the status code indicates success (e.g., 200 OK), proceed to check for the specified anchor. This approach would address both aspects: it would accurately report when a document is not reachable due to an HTTP error, and it would also retain the capability to verify the existence of anchors in documents that are successfully retrieved."
