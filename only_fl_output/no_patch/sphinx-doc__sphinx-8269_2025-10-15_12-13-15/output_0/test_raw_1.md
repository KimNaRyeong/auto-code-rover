Given the previous attempt to reproduce the issue with the standalone Python script that failed due to the absence of `sphinx-quickstart` in the runtime environment, we must adapt our approach. The suggested script ran into difficulties because `sphinx-quickstart` wasn't found, indicating a potential issue with the environment setup or the command's availability within the script's execution context.

To address these concerns while still providing a reproducible example, the script below is crafted to replicate the setup of a Sphinx project programmatically, avoiding reliance on the `sphinx-quickstart` command line tool. This will ensure the script runs in environments where Sphinx is installed but `sphinx-quickstart` might not be directly available or environments where the Sphinx Python API is preferable for project setup.

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess
from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sphinx_project_setup():
    # Setting up a minimal Sphinx config
    conf = {
        'project': 'proj',
        'author': 'me',
        'release': '1.0',
        'extensions': [],
        'master_doc': 'index',
        'language': 'en',
    }
    os.makedirs('source', exist_ok=True)
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        for key, val in conf.items():
            f.write(f"{key} = '{val}'\n")
    
    # Creating index file
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. toctree::\n')
        f.write('\n')
        f.write('Welcome to proj\'s documentation!\n')
        f.write('=================================\n\n')
        f.write('`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_\n')

        assert expected_error not in output, "Sphinx linkcheck incorrectly reports missing anchors instead of HTTP errors."
    except AssertionError as e:

        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:

This script avoids external dependencies and command-line tool execution where possible, opting instead for direct manipulation of files and Sphinx's Python API for setup and testing. It attempts to mimic the `sphinx-quickstart` process minimally, focusing on the critical parts necessary to replicate the reported issue. The script still tries to verify the expected failure condition (linkcheck misreporting the kind of error encountered) and uses Python's standard error handling and reporting mechanisms to output diagnostic information if the test fails.
