        "intended_behavior": "Modify the behavior when the `--noinput` flag is used so that if the command would normally stop and ask for user input, it instead logs a warning or informational message to the console. This ensures the command remains non-interactive under the `--noinput` scenario while providing necessary feedback to the user or script about the need for manual intervention. This message could be similar to \"No migrations applied because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\" This adjustment is crucial for maintaining scriptability and user awareness in automated deployment processes."
