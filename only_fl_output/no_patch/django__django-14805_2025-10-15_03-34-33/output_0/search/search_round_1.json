It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.\nI'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like\n\"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\"\nwould be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.\n</issue>"

This is critical because:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** These files contain the implementation of the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands within Django's management commands framework. This framework allows Django to handle command-line operations for various administrative tasks, such as applying migrations or creating migration files.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The issue description points towards a behavior within these commands when executed with the `--noinput` flag. Specifically, there's a lack of output under certain conditions which inhibits the user or calling scripts from understanding what the command is doing or if it fails due to requiring user input. The code within `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` and `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` is directly responsible for implementing the behavior of these commands, including how they handle the `--noinput` flag and produce output.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior, as requested in the issue, would be to modify these commands to provide feedback when they do not perform an action because they're run with `--noinput`. This feedback could be a warning or an informative message that lets the script or the user know that input was required but could not be provided due to the `--noinput` option, thus no action was taken.\n\nConsidering the identified files and how they relate to the issue, the next steps involve diving deeper into the implementation of these commands. Specifically, looking into how they handle the `--noinput` flag and where in the code it would be appropriate to add output signaling that input was needed but not provided.\n\nThe appropriate steps to gather more context and refine our approach would be to analyze the code handling the `--noinput` option in each file:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--noinput\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`: To see how the `--noinput` option is processed in the `makemigrations` command.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--noinput\", \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\")`: To understand how the `--noinput` option is handled in the `migrate` command."

While the exact method name is not provided from the provided information, the intended adjustment would be within the method handling execution flow, likely the `handle` method or one closely related to the processing of command-line arguments.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that even with `--noinput` option enabled, a message is output to the user when the command needs input from the user to proceed but is unable to due to the `--noinput` flag. This preserves the functionality of the command while enhancing user feedback for scripting and manual interventions. The message should be clear, informing the user that no migrations were run because user input was required but skipped.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\n  - **Class:** Not specified due to the details provided, but implied to be the main command handler for `migrate`.\n  - **Method:** The specific method within this file that deals with the `--noinput` option. Similar to the `makemigrations` command, this would likely be within the `handle` method or a related method that processes the command-line options.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the behavior when the `--noinput` flag is used so that if the command would normally stop and ask for user input, it instead logs a warning or informational message to the console. This ensures the command remains non-interactive under the `--noinput` scenario while providing necessary feedback to the user or script about the need for manual intervention. This message could be similar to \"No migrations applied because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\" This adjustment is crucial for maintaining scriptability and user awareness in automated deployment processes.\n\nThe intended behaviors specified for both `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands aim to enhance the usability and scriptability of Django's management commands by providing clear and actionable feedback when operations are skipped due to the `--noinput` option. This helps in maintaining automated workflows and enhances the overall developer experience by avoiding silent failures or unexplained behaviors."
