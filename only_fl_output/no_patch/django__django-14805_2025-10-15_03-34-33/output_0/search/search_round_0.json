It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.\nI'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like\n\"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\"\nwould be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.\n</issue>"

Since the issue involves the behavior of command-line options for \"makemigrations\" and \"migrate\" commands, it's likely these are managed within command handling classes or methods in Django's codebase.\n2. To get started, we need to identify where these commands are implemented in the Django codebase.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_class(\"MakemigrationsCommand\")`: This will help us find the class responsible for the `makemigrations` command.\n- `search_class(\"MigrateCommand\")`: This should help us locate the class responsible for handling the `migrate` command.\n- `search_method(\"handle\")`: Looking for the `handle` method may provide insight into how command inputs, including `--noinput`, are processed since `handle` is typically the method that executes the command logic in Django command classes."
