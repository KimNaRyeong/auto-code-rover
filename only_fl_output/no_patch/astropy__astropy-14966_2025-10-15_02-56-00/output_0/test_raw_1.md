Given the instructions and considering the need to directly address the reported issue in the question, here's another attempt to craft a tailored `reproducer.py` script. Please note that, based on the feedback, I've adjusted the script to better match the original problem statement regarding the group keys missing units in `astropy.table.QTable`. Additionally, I've incorporated explicit unit checking for each key to accurately capture the failure scenario described.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantity_group_keys():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u

    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.,] * u.m})
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')

    for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
        length_val = cols[0]  # Assuming 'length' is the first column in keys
        # Check if 'length_val' is an instance of Quantity and whether it retains its unit 'meter'
        if not (hasattr(length_val, 'unit') and length_val.unit == u.m):
            raise AssertionError("Group keys should be quantities with units 'meter'.")

try:
    test_quantity_group_keys()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Ensure non-zero exit code for failure
except Exception as e:
    # Catching other exceptions to provide detailed feedback
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
else:
    print("Test passed, issue is fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script further refines the expectation that each group key of a `QTable` grouped by a quantity column retains the unit of measurement. In case the original issue is precisely about the absence of units in the group keys (which is what the initial problem statement suggests), this script aims to not only verify the presence of quantities with units but also ensure that the correct unit ('meter' in this case) is associated with each key. This aligns with the detailed expectations for a fixed issue.
