Investigating the implementation of `degree` in `polytools.py`.\n2. Gaining an overview of how rational functions are handled in the relevant `polys` submodules, if directly related code segments or comments indicate such handling. \n\nFor now, we'll start by focusing on the `polytools.py` file where the three matches of `degree` were found, as it's the most likely place to contain the relevant implementation or clue regarding the issue:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"degree\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")`"

Let's analyze each in turn:\n\n### Search Result 1 (`degree` function in `polytools.py`)\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   This implementation of `degree` works with a general expression (`f`) and attempts to compute its degree in the variable (`gen`). It handles both cases where `f` is already a `Poly` object and where it may need conversion from an expression to a `Poly` object. Notably, it returns the degree of the polynomial or `-oo` for the zero polynomial and tries to handle multivariate expressions by warning the user when a symbolic generator is required.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**  \n   The issue appears to arise when the input is a rational function, i.e., a fraction of two polynomials. This code path seems not to explicitly handle rational functions differently than it would a single polynomial or any general expression. It likely treats the numerator and denominator as a single polynomial expression which is not the intended calculation for the degree of a rational function. The degree of a rational function should be the difference between the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**  \n   The intended behavior should account specifically for rational functions by checking if the input expression (`f`) is a division of two polynomials and, if so, compute the degree of the rational function as the degree of the numerator minus the degree of the denominator. This needs to be explicitly implemented to address the issue, ensuring that the function returns the correct degree for both polynomial and rational function inputs. \n\n### Search Results 2 & 3 (`degree` method within `Poly` class)\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   This `degree` method applies to a `Poly` object and determines the degree of the polynomial in a specified generator (`gen`). It processes through the polynomial's representation (`rep`) to compute the degree exclusively for the supplied generator.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**  \n   There does not seem to be an immediate relevance, as the issue relates more to the handling of rational functions rather than the handling of polynomial objects (`Poly`). This method works under the assumption that `f` is already a `Poly` object, and doesn't directly deal with arbitrary expressions or the quotient of polynomials.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**  \n   No change needed in this context to resolve the reported issue, as this mechanism operates as expected for its scope, which is within the polynomial (`Poly`) context.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe bug specifically concerns the first context (`search result 1`), where the `degree` function doesn't account for rational functions in a manner aligned with mathematical expectations. To resolve it, enhancement in the part of the code that handles the degree computation is needed to distinguish between simple polynomials and rational functions and compute their degrees accordingly."

This can be achieved by first checking if the input `f` is a division of two polynomials (a rational function). If so, the method should separately compute the degrees of the numerator and the denominator polynomials and then return the difference (degree of numerator - degree of denominator) as the degree of the rational function. This ensures that the method preserves its existing functionality for polynomials, while also correctly handling the case of rational functions. Existing checks for the nature of `f` (whether it is a `Poly` object or requires conversion from an expression) should be maintained, incorporating this new logic in a way that it firstly identifies the case of a rational function and then proceeds with the specialized computation for such cases. Additionally, this approach should not interfere with the current practice for single polynomials, ensuring compatibility with the existing uses of the `degree` method."
