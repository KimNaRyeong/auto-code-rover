Based on your requirements for a script that properly demonstrates the issue and exits as expected, see the revised version below. This version directly checks for the specific problem mentioned in the given LaTeX output, ensuring it raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., if it detects the problematic LaTeX code). Otherwise, it acknowledges the absence of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)
    latex_str = latex((M*N)[i, j])
    # Check if the generated LaTeX string contains incorrect syntax that leads to compilation errors
    if "\\sum_{i_{1}=0}^{k - 1} M_{i, _i_1} N_{_i_1, j}" in latex_str:
        raise AssertionError("Detected double subscript in LaTeX output, confirming issue presence.")
    print("No issue detected with LaTeX output generation.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensuring a 0 exit code, as specified.
        exit(0)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- The script now includes a direct check for the exact LaTeX pattern that was leading to an error. This approach is more accurate for confirming the specific issue described, ensuring the `AssertionError` is raised only when the problematic pattern exists in the output.
- If the specific problematic pattern is not found, it prints "No issue detected with LaTeX output generation," suggesting the issue might have been resolved or does not exist under the current conditions.
- The try-except block ensures any raised `AssertionError` (or any other exception) is caught, printed with the provided stack trace printing function, and still exits with code 0 as per your instructions for demonstrating when the issue is potentially fixed.
