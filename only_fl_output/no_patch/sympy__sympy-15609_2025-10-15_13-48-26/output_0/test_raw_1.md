Given the misunderstanding in the earlier instructions, let's rectify this with a proper implementation that specifically captures the presence of the issue. The script below aims to accurately reproduce the issue described and behaves accordingly when the issue is detected or not.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latex_compilability():
    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)
    try:
        latex_str = latex((M*N)[i, j])
        # This checks if the generated LaTeX string has the double subscript error
        if "_{_}" in latex_str:
            raise AssertionError("Generated LaTeX string contains a double subscript, making it not compilable.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 0 even if there is an exception (as required for demonstration purposes)
        exit(0)
    print("LaTeX string is compilable, no issue found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_latex_compilability()
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` if and only if the generated LaTeX string contains a pattern that could cause compilation issues due to double subscript notation. If such a pattern is not present, it signifies that the issue might have been resolved, and it reports that no issue was found, fulfilling the requirement to exit with code 0.
