This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context, let's consider each part:\n\n### Message Class\n\nThe `Message` class contains an `__init__` method that accepts `level`, `message`, and `extra_tags` with a default value of `None`. This class representation doesn't include the exact handling of `extra_tags` outside of its initialization but sets a foundation for how messages are structured, with `extra_tags` being optional.\n\n**Relation to Bug**: Since `extra_tags` defaults to `None` but is also expected to work correctly with an empty string `\"\"`, there might be a need to ensure consistent treatment of `extra_tags` across serialization and deserialization processes.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: When `extra_tags` is `\"\"`, it should retain its value (an empty string) through serialization and deserialization, rather than being interpreted or converted to `None`.\n\n### MessageEncoder Class\n\nAlthough no specific `encode` method was found for `MessageEncoder`, the class extends `json.JSONEncoder`, and its `default` method would typically handle special serialization cases. The absence of a direct result necessitates examining how this class's `default` method manages instances of `Message`, particularly focusing on `extra_tags`.\n\n**Relation to Bug**: The adaptation or override of the `default` method in `MessageEncoder` could be where `extra_tags` needs to be explicitly handled to maintain `\"\"` instead of coercing to `None` or being dropped.\n\n### MessageDecoder Class\n\nThe `MessageDecoder` extends `json.JSONDecoder`, and the `decode` method uses `self.process_messages` after decoding the JSON string `s`. This method should then be responsible for reconstructing `Message` objects from the decoded JSON.\n\n**Relation to Bug**: The `decode` method and possibly the `process_messages` routine are likely places where `extra_tags` could be misinterpreted or not carefully reconstructed to its original state (`\"\"` versus `None`).\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the information and understanding of the bug, further investigation into how `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` treat `extra_tags` is required. Specifically, we lacked direct insight into the `MessageEncoder`'s mechanism for handling `extra_tags` during serialization. A logical next step would be to look into the `default` method in `MessageEncoder`, where customization of object serialization likely occurs.\n\n**Additional API Calls Needed**:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"MessageEncoder\")`: To investigate how `MessageEncoder` serializes objects, especially looking for how `extra_tags` is handled. Since the expected `encode` method wasn\u2019t directly found, we deduced `default` could hold the logic for serializing `Message` objects given `MessageEncoder` inherits from `json.JSONEncoder`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"process_messages\", \"MessageDecoder\")`: This would provide insight into how messages, specifically `extra_tags`, are reconstructed during deserialization, which is critical for resolving the issue.\n\nThese steps are essential in understanding the exact serialization and deserialization process of `extra_tags` within the Django Messages framework and addressing the bug effectively."

        "content": "### Analyzing the Collected Context\n\n**MessageEncoder.default Method:**\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `default` method in `MessageEncoder` customizes the serialization process for `Message` objects. It checks if the object is an instance of `Message`, and then constructs a list representing the message. This list includes a special key, whether the message content is considered \"safe data\" (to control escaping in templates), the message's level, and its text. If `extra_tags` is truthy, it gets appended to this list.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - This method's handling of `extra_tags` directly relates to the reported issue. The condition `if obj.extra_tags:` means that if `extra_tags` is an empty string (falsy in Python), it will not be included in the serialized message. This behavior leads to `extra_tags` being undistinguished from `None` once deserialized, consistent with the bug description.\n\n3. **Intended behavior to resolve the issue:**\n   - The intended behavior here would be to ensure that `extra_tags` is always serialized, even if it's an empty string, to distinguish it from `None`. One approach could be to always include `extra_tags` in the serialized list but marking it explicitly when it's empty or `None`. \n\n**MessageDecoder.process_messages Method:**\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This method processes the deserialized JSON object. For items that match the serialized `Message` structure, it converts them back into `Message` instances. The method specifically looks for a list starting with a special key to identify message objects and reconstructs them, including handling safe text.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - Since the encoder may not include `extra_tags` if it's an empty string, this method won't have a chance to correctly set `extra_tags` to an empty string upon deserialization\u2014it will remain `None` if the `extra_tags` was omitted during serialization. This behavior is a direct consequence of how the encoder treats `extra_tags`.\n\n3. **Intended behavior to resolve the issue:**\n   - To address the problem, the `process_messages` method needs to be able to correctly handle or infer the `extra_tags` attribute even when it's not explicitly included in the serialized object. Given this method interprets the structure of the serialized data, an explicit indicator for `extra_tags` being an empty string would allow this method to reconstruct the `Message` object accurately, preserving `extra_tags` as an empty string when necessary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo resolve the issue, the serialization process (in `MessageEncoder.default`) must ensure `extra_tags` is represented in a way that allows the deserialization process (in `MessageDecoder.process_messages`) to accurately reconstruct its value, including differentiating between `None` and an empty string. Encoder adjustments would involve modifying the condition for including `extra_tags` to ensure it's always part of the serialized data, and decoder adjustments to correctly interpret the presence or specific marking of `extra_tags` as an empty string."
