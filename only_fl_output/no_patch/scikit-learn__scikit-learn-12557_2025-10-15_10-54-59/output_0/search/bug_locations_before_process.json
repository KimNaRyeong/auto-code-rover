        "intended_behavior": "The `predict` method should include a tie-breaking mechanism consistent with the one used in the `decision_function`. This means when `predict` makes a classification decision based on the output of the `decision_function`, it needs to apply the same or compatible logic for breaking ties between classes. This could involve modifying how the decision scores are interpreted to select the winning class, ensuring that the choice is consistent if `decision_function` indicates a tie."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `decision_function` seems to work as intended by providing a signed distance to the separating hyperplane, clarification or adjustment may be necessary to ensure it aligns with `predict` regarding tie-breaking. If `decision_function` is modified to include explicit tie-breaking logic, this logic should be transparent and designed to work seamlessly with how `predict` uses the decision function's scores. Alternatively, if the decision function already handles ties in a specific way, documentation or code comments should clarify this to ensure that the implementation of `predict` can align with these expectations."
