        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context on multiple fronts. Primarily, we need to understand how `OuterRef`, `Subquery`, and the `.union()` method or `|` operator are being utilized within the codebase. This will require us to look into the classes or methods where these constructs are likely being used. Given the specifics of the issue, let's focus on the classes and methods that are involved in query construction, particularly where there might be custom implementations or extensions of the Django `QuerySet`.\n\nHere are the API calls we will make:\n\n1. search_class(\"Document\")\n   - To get context on the `Document` model and any custom manager or queryset methods it might have since the issue involves building queries off this model.\n\n2. search_method(\"annotate\")\n   - To find uses of the `.annotate()` method across the codebase, giving us insights into custom annotations being applied, which may include the problematic usage of `Subquery` and `OuterRef`.\n\n3. search_code(\"OuterRef\")\n   - This code search aims to find instances where `OuterRef` is being used, which might lead us to other models or queries where similar patterns (potentially problematic) are being used.\n\n4. search_code(\"Subquery\")\n   - Similarly, this code search will help us find usages of `Subquery`, particularly in the context of complex queries where the issue might be reproducible or where solutions/workarounds have been implemented.\n\n5. search_code(\".union(\")\n   - To get context on how the `.union()` method is being used within the project, which will be essential for understanding the issue at hand and potential implications of proposed fixes.\n\n6. search_code(\"|\")\n   - Given that `|` (OR operator) is very common, this search may yield a lot of results. However, it's included with the hope of finding uses within queryset constructions specifically, which could be relevant to the issue.\n\nThese searches combined should provide a comprehensive view of how complex queries are constructed within the project, highlight any custom patterns or extensions in use, and may point to related pieces of code where similar issues have been addressed or could potentially arise."
