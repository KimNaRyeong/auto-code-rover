        "intended_behavior": "The `polyval` method should correctly handle inputs with `timedelta64` data types, ensuring that polynomial coefficients are evaluated accurately against these types of coordinates. The intended behavior is to maintain compatibility with `timedelta64` inputs, ensuring that the conversion or interpretation of these data types aligns with their use in polynomial equations, possibly by normalizing or accurately converting these time deltas to a numerical form that can be correctly applied in polynomial calculations. This involves either adjusting the `polyval` method to correctly interpret `timedelta64` types without loss of precision or ensuring that any type conversions preserve the semantics of the operation consistent with how it was correctly handled in version `2022.3.0` of xarray. Additionally, any recent changes that may have introduced a regression in handling `timedelta64` should be identified and rectified to restore the expected functionality."
