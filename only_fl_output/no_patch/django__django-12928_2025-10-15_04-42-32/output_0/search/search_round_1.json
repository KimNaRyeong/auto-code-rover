It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

The issue description suggests changes are needed in the configuration of Django templates, particularly in how the cached template loader is set up to allow for autoreloading during development. The referenced `TEMPLATES` configuration indicates that changes might be needed both in the Django settings and possibly in the template loading mechanism itself.\n\nGiven this information, we should:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the Django template backend configuration to understand how the `TEMPLATES` setting is processed.\n2. Investigate the cached template loader mechanism to see where and how it could support autoreloading based on the `DEBUG` mode or an `autoreload` option.\n3. Since the issue references a patch based on a fix for another issue, it would also be helpful to understand the current implementation of both caching and template loading.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\")` to find the class handling Django template loading.\n- `search_code(\"cached template loader\")` to find the code or configuration snippet where the cached template loader is implemented or referenced.\n- `search_method(\"get_template\")` because the method for getting or loading a template might contain logic we need to modify for autoreloading.\n- `search_code(\"'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'\")` to find where the backend is set up or modified in the codebase.\n\nLet's proceed with these calls to gather the necessary context."

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context with the three questions in mind:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `DjangoTemplates` Class in `django/template/backends/django.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThis class represents the Django template backend specific for handling Django's templating system. It extends a base engine class, indicating that it defines the methods and properties required to manage templates in a Django application, including initialization, loading templates from strings or files, and accessing template tag libraries.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThis class is directly related to the issue as it handles template loading and processing. Since the issue discusses enabling autoreload behavior for the cached template loader, modifications or extensions might be needed in this class, especially in the `get_template` method or during initialization, to support autoreloading based on configuration options.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would involve updating the class to either:\n   - Check if autoreloading is enabled in the options and, if so, implement or trigger mechanisms for detecting changes in template files without needing to restart the server.\n   - Or, interact with the cached template loader in a way that it can respect the autoreload configuration, possibly through a parameter or a related method that checks for file modifications.\n\n### 2. Search for \"Cached Template Loader\"\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe absence of direct references to \"cached template loader\" might suggest that the terminology used in the issue description does not match verbatim with codebase implementations or comments. However, Django typically provides a mechanism for caching templates to improve performance by avoiding reloading and parsing templates from disk on every request.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue is proposing enhancements to the cached template loading mechanism to support autoreloading, which suggests that the cached template loader's functionality needs to be analyzed further, especially in handling cache invalidation or updates when template files change.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nIdeally, the cached template loader should be capable of:\n   - Detecting changes in templates during development (when `DEBUG` or `autoreload` is true).\n   - Dynamically reloading updated templates without needing to flush the entire cache or restart the server.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context\n\nGiven the results, some potential next steps to gather more context could include:\n\n- **Exploring the `get_template` Method in Relevant Classes:**\n  Search deeper into how templates are loaded and cached, particularly in:\n  - `django/template/backends/django.py`\n  - `django/template/loaders/cached.py`\n\n- **Understanding Template Loader Implementation:**\n  Since the direct search for \"cached template loader\" did not yield results, examining the `loaders` configuration and how it interacts with caching in the detailed files above might be insightful.\n\n### Suggested API Calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/backends/django.py\")`: To get more details on how DjangoTemplates handles template loading.\n- `search_class_in_file(\"CachedLoader\", \"django/template/loaders/cached.py\")`: Adjusting the search to likely class names based on Django's naming conventions might yield the implementation details of the cached template loader.\n  \nThese calls aim to pinpoint where changes may be applied to introduce the desired autoreload behavior for templates in development, addressing both the backend mechanism for template loading and the specific handling of caching and reloading."

When the `autoreload` option is set to `True`, this should enable the template backend to utilize a caching mechanism that also supports checking for changes in template files. The existing functionality for initializing the backend and configuring it based on provided parameters should be preserved, while adding the capability to register or acknowledge an autoreload mechanism.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `django/template/loaders/cached.py`\n- **Class:** _Potentially to be identified or created, such as `CachedLoader`_\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nConsidering there was no direct reference to a `CachedLoader` class in the provided API search results, but assuming its existence based on Django's naming and implementation patterns, the intended behavior here would be to enhance or ensure the `get_template` method (or equivalent functionality within the cached loading mechanism) supports autoreloading. This means implementing a check for template file changes before serving a cached version of a template. If a change is detected, the loader should refresh its cache for the changed template. This behavior should only be activated when the `autoreload` option is enabled in the backend configuration to avoid affecting performance in production environments.\n\nThese modifications aim to resolve the issue by enabling developers to benefit from the speed of cached templates while also getting instant feedback on template changes without the need to manually clear the cache or restart the development server."
