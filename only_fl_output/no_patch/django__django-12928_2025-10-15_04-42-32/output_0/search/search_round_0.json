It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

Each API call must have concrete arguments as inputs."

        "content": "To address the issue of implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader in a Django project, we need to gather some context about where and how templates are loaded and cached. The issue description suggests changes are needed in the configuration of Django templates, particularly in how the cached template loader is set up to allow for autoreloading during development. The referenced `TEMPLATES` configuration indicates that changes might be needed both in the Django settings and possibly in the template loading mechanism itself.\n\nGiven this information, we should:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the Django template backend configuration to understand how the `TEMPLATES` setting is processed.\n2. Investigate the cached template loader mechanism to see where and how it could support autoreloading based on the `DEBUG` mode or an `autoreload` option.\n3. Since the issue references a patch based on a fix for another issue, it would also be helpful to understand the current implementation of both caching and template loading.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\")` to find the class handling Django template loading.\n- `search_code(\"cached template loader\")` to find the code or configuration snippet where the cached template loader is implemented or referenced.\n- `search_method(\"get_template\")` because the method for getting or loading a template might contain logic we need to modify for autoreloading.\n- `search_code(\"'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'\")` to find where the backend is set up or modified in the codebase.\n\nLet's proceed with these calls to gather the necessary context."
