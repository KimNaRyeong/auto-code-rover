        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0 effectively, we need to gather context about how the project currently determines and utilizes the SQLite version. Specifically, we need to look for code that checks the SQLite version and possibly code that takes advantage of features specific to SQLite 3.9.0 and above. Given the nature of the issue related to database functionality and version checking, we are likely looking at initialization code or utilities that interact with the database.\n\nFirst, let's identify if there's a centralized way the project currently checks the SQLite version. This process typically involves checking against a version string or using a feature check that indirectly determines version capability.\n\n1. **Search for version check logic**:\n   - Search for a method or a code snippet that might be responsible for checking the SQLite version. This includes direct version string comparisons or feature checks that distinguish between SQLite versions.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite version check\")\nsearch_code(\"3.9.0\")\n```\n\n2. **Identify features specific to SQLite >= 3.9.0**:\n   - Since the issue mentions indexes on expressions and the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option as features requiring SQLite 3.9.0+, it makes sense to look for their usage within the project. This will help in understanding how these features are integrated and possibly hint at how the version check is implemented.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"indexes on expressions\")\nsearch_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of how SQLite versioning is currently handled in the project, including any direct references to the 3.9.0 version or specific features available from that version onwards. This context is essential for updating the project to drop support for older SQLite versions effectively."

This could mean several things:\n- The project may implicitly support certain SQLite versions based on the features used or the environments it's targeted to run in, without specific checks.\n- The version compliance may be ensured through documentation or external dependencies rather than coded checks.\n- The SQLite version might be checked in a more generic way, not specifically looking for \"3.9.0\" or the mentioned features.\n\nGiven this, we should explore alternative avenues to understand how the project interfaces with SQLite, which could lead us to how it might enforce or check version compatibility. Here are a few revised search strategies:\n\n1. **Search for database initialization or configuration code** - This code might include clues about version expectations or checks, even in a broad or indirect manner.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite database initialization\")\nsearch_code(\"database configuration\")\n```\n\n2. **Explore documentation or comments** - While API search is code-focused, sometimes the check or requirement is documented in comments near database setup or feature usage.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite\")\nsearch_code(\"database version\")\n```\n\n3. **Identify any utility functions or classes that interact with SQLite** - There might be utility classes or methods specifically designed to interact with the SQLite database, which could include version checks or compatibility layers.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SQLite utility\")\n```\n\nThese searches are intended to find broader context or indirect references to database version handling in the absence of direct code snippets or methods related to SQLite version checks or the specific features mentioned in the issue."
