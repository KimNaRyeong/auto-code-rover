The current implementation likely allows 'db_collation' to be specified, but may not ensure it is consistently applied across related foreign key references in migrations. The code fix should address this propagation issue without disrupting the existing functionality for non-related fields."

        "intended_behavior": "Within this file, particularly in the sections that define or manipulate 'ForeignKey' fields, additional logic is required to check the 'db_collation' of the referenced field (if any) and apply it to the 'ForeignKey' field during migrations. The intention is for foreign keys to maintain database consistency by automatically adopting the 'db_collation' of their referenced primary key fields when migrations are generated, thus preventing collation mismatch errors. This adjustment should ensure that fields referencing custom or altered collation settings adhere to those settings across all related tables, respecting database constraints."
