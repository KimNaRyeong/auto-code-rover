Given the misunderstanding, let me provide a corrected script that will only exit with code 0 when the issue at hand (a crash caused by attempting to save a zero-width figure with Matplotlib, which triggers a `RuntimeError` from `libpng`) has been rectified. If the issue is still present, the script will illustrate an appropriate stack trace and will ensure to exit non-zero due to an unhandled AssertionError, following your specifications more accurately.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_libpng_crash_with_zero_width_figure():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    try:
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))
        plt.savefig("test.png")
        # If no exception, assume issue is fixed.
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if test_libpng_crash_with_zero_width_figure():
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 for success scenario
    else:
        # If reaching this point, means test failed but exception has already been printed.
        assert False, "The issue is still present."
```
By executing this script (`python3 reproducerer.py`), the action flow will be such:

1. The script attempts to trigger the bug by invoking `matplotlib`'s `savefig` function on a figure with zero height.
2. If this operation completes without raising an exception, it implies the underlying issue might have been fixed, resulting in the script exiting with a code of `0`, indicating success.
3. If an exception is caught, the `print_stacktrace` function will display the error detailedly.
4. The script explicitly asserts `False` if the problem persists, ensuring the process terminates with a non-zero exit code, signalling failure or the presence of the bug.
   
Ensure that `matplotlib` is installed in your environment (`pip install matplotlib`) before running the script, as the stack trace indicates it wasn't found.
