        "intended_behavior": "This method should include validation for the `figsize` argument to ensure that both width and height are positive numbers. Since it currently allows creating figures with zero or negative dimensions, leading to errors when saving, a check should be introduced early in the method. If invalid dimensions are specified, it should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that both width and height must be greater than zero. This preserves the method's functionality while preventing the creation of figures with dimensions that are not valid for rendering or saving."

        "method": "savefig",
        "intended_behavior": "The `savefig` method across its various implementations should include a pre-save validation process that checks if the figure dimensions (width and height) are valid (i.e., greater than zero). If the dimensions are not valid, it should raise an informative `RuntimeError` or a `ValueError` explaining that saving a figure requires both width and height to be positive numbers. This change will prevent unhandled low-level errors (e.g., from libpng) by catching the issue at the matplotlib level, thereby providing a more informative error message to the user. This intended behavior also maintains the functionality of the method while enforcing a check that aligns with the requirements of dependent libraries like libpng."
