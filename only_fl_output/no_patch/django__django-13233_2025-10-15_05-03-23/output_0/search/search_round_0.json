If it is the later, is there an alternative to find the concrete model an image field belongs to? I'm classifying this as a bug because the change made model and field introspection harder than it was before. Also, since behavior changed #31701 may possibly not be classified as a cleanup/optimization anymore...\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding the `model` attribute of image fields not pointing to the concrete model in Django version 3.2, we would need to understand how the `model` attribute was being used and what changes were made to cause this issue. The issue description mentions the change happened due to the fix of #31701, which would likely involve modifications to the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, specifically around how image fields (likely a subclass of FileField) and their relation to models are handled.\n\nLet's focus on gathering more context about how image fields are linked to models and any changes made in Django 3.2 that could have affected this functionality. It would be helpful to examine the classes and methods related to image fields and possibly the commit or changeset that resolved #31701. Given that we do not have specific class or method names from the issue description, I recommend starting with searches related to image fields and models in Django's codebase.\n\nI will proceed with the following API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"FileField\")` - Since image fields in Django are likely an extension of `FileField`, looking into this class might give us insights into how the `model` attribute is managed.\n2. `search_method(\"contribute_to_class\")` - This method is commonly used in Django models for adding fields to models. If the `model` attribute linkage has changed, it might be related to this method.\n3. `search_code(\"#31701\")` - To find any code comments or documentation referencing the fix for issue #31701, which could directly lead us to the changes that affected the `model` attribute behavior. \n\nThese searches are designed to contextualize the problem and identify starting points for further investigation."
