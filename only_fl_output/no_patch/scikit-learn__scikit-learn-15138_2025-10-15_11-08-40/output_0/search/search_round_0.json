        "content": "To resolve this issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where the changes need to be applied within the project's codebase. The issue points towards modifying the behavior of a `final_estimator` in a stacking mechanism, potentially similar to what's described in the mlxtend library. Given this, it's essential to identify the specific class(es) and methods involved in stacking and possibly the training process of the `final_estimator`.\n\nHence, the initial steps involve identifying the relevant classes and methods that handle the stacking mechanism and the training of the `final_estimator`. We can start by searching for classes related to stacking or ensemble methods. Since the term \"stacking\" is explicitly mentioned, let's start with a search for classes and methods that might be directly connected to the implementation of stacking.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n1. search_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\n2. search_class(\"StackingEstimator\")\n3. search_method(\"fit\")\n\nThese calls aim to uncover:\n- Any existing `StackingClassifier` or `StackingEstimator` class where the enhancement could be pertinent.\n- The general `fit` method implementations that might be involved in training the `final_estimator`, as integrating the original dataset into the training process will likely require modifications here."
