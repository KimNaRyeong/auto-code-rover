        "intended_behavior": "The `convert_to` method should ensure that the conversion between quantities with dimensions (such as voltage and current to ohm) adheres to the SI system accurately, reflecting the expected mathematical relationship without causing scale discrepancies. To resolve the issue, this method must correctly apply the scale factors of both the numerator and denominator in operations, ensuring the output is consistent with SI unit definitions. The method should account for the intrinsic scale factor of the units involved in the conversion, applying them such that 1V/1A results in 1\u03a9, without an extraneous division by 1000. Enhancements might include an internal review and potentially an adjustment of how `scale_factor` values are applied during conversion to guarantee that the resulting mathematical representation matches the expected SI unit result."

        "intended_behavior": "It is suggested to encapsulate the `scale_factor` property to shield it from direct external manipulation, which could be contributing to misuse or misunderstanding, as highlighted by the issue. Making `scale_factor` private (e.g., `_scale_factor`) and controlling access via getter/setter methods could be a solution. These methods should enforce checks or transformations ensuring that the `scale_factor` adheres to the SI units correctly and is internally consistent. Furthermore, this approach could include logic to automatically correct or adjust `scale_factors` based on the unit system or specific operations being performed, offering a more robust mechanism for maintaining consistency in unit conversions."
