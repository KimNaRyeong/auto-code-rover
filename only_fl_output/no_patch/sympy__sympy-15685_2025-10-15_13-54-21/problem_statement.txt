Make .scale_factor private in the units module

### Description

Dividing a Quantity with dimension voltage by a Quantity with dimension current yields ohm/1000 when I expected ohm. In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 Î©.

### What I Did

```
>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to
>>> vs = Quantity('vs')
>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)
>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')
>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)
>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)
ohm/1000
```

### Further discussion
The problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.
```
>>> vs.scale_factor
1.0
```

The docstring for `scale_factor' states:

> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.

But, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.
```
>>> ohm.scale_factor
1000

This value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.
