        "intended_behavior": "The code in this location should ensure that when `json.dumps` is used for serializing JSONField data, it supports non-ASCII characters (like Chinese) properly. The default behavior of `json.dumps` is to escape non-ASCII characters, which results in the ASCII representation. To address the issue, ensure the serialization uses `ensure_ascii=False` argument with `json.dumps` to allow Unicode characters to be encoded and displayed correctly. This change should preserve all existing functionalities of JSONField serialization and deserialization in Django but enhance it to properly handle and display Unicode characters in Django admin."
