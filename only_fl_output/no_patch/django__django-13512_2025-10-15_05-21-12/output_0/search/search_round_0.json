        "content": "To effectively gather more context about the issue related to the JSONField handling unicode characters improperly in Django admin, particularly when dealing with Chinese characters, we should first look into the Django project's usage of JSON serialization methods. Given the mention of a pull request to the `django-mysql` repo, it suggests the changes or relevant code might be located in files that deal with JSONField serialization or admin display functionality for models involving JSONFields.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be beneficial for understanding the problem and potentially finding where the solution has been applied:\n\n1. Search across the codebase for the usage of `json.dumps` method since it's directly mentioned in the issue description. This will help identify where the ASCII encoding issue may originate from.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"json.dumps\")\n   ```\n\n2. The problem is specifically mentioned to occur in the Django admin when editing a `JsonField` that contains Chinese characters. Therefore, we should look for any customizations or monkey patches applied to the Django admin related to `JsonField`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"JsonField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the admin does not display unicode characters properly, it might be helpful to search for code that is specifically related to how fields are rendered or displayed in the Django admin interface.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"admin.ModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n4. The resolution suggests that a pull request made to `django-mysql` contains a fix. While we can't directly search a third-party repository's pull requests, we can look for potential integration points or customizations within the Django project that may involve `django-mysql`.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"django-mysql\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering a broad context around the serialization of JSON fields, how they are handled within Django admin, and any potential third-party library (`django-mysql`) integrations that may influence the behavior described in the issue."
