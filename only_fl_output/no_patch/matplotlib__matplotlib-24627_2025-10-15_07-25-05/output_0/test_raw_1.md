Given the clarification and the specific requirements to raise an `AssertionError` only when the issue is present, I'll adjust the approach to correctly reproduce the issue and meet these requirements.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def main():
    try:
        # Initial setup for first scenario
        f1, a1 = plt.subplots()
        l1, = a1.plot([1, 2])
        l1.remove()
        if l1.axes is not None:
            raise AssertionError("After l1.remove(), l1.axes should be None")

        # Initial setup for second scenario
        f2, a2 = plt.subplots()
        l2, = a2.plot([1, 2])
        a2.cla()
        if l2.axes is not None:   # If the issue is present, l2.axes will not be None
            raise AssertionError("After a2.cla(), l2.axes should be None")
        
        # Exiting with 0 if the issue is fixed or not present
        print("Issue not reproduced, exit code 0.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure non-zero exit code if the issue is present

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script revises the initial attempt to clearly adhere to the instructions provided. When executed, it will:
- Examine if after an artist is removed or after the axes are cleared, their `.axes` attribute is set to `None`.
- Raise an `AssertionError` if the `.axes` attribute is incorrectly set after these operations, which implies the presence of the issue.
- Print a detailed stack trace of where the check failed, using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- Exit with code 1 if an `AssertionError` is caught, indicating the issue is present; otherwise, it prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed or not present.
