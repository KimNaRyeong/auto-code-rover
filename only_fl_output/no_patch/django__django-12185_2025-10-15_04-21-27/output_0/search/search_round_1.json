The regression mentioned seems to be a specific change affecting how Django ORM handles window expressions in `SELECT` clauses. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `NotSupportedError` to find where it's raised in relation to window functions or expressions within the Django ORM. This will help us understand the conditions under which the error is thrown.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"NotSupportedError\")\n```\n\n2. The `Window` class is crucial to understanding how window expressions are built and how they might interact with the ORM's mechanism for constructing queries. Getting context around its implementation will provide insights into potential locations for the regression.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Window\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue refers to the use of `Case` and `When` within an annotation, it's essential to examine these classes as well. This will give us insight into how conditional expressions are handled and evaluated, particularly in conjunction with window functions.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Case\")\nsearch_class(\"When\")\n```\n\n4. The error appears during the processing of an annotation which suggests that the issue might lie within the logic that handles the compilation or execution of annotations, particularly those involving window functions.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"annotate\")\n```\n\n5. Because the issue description specifically mentions that the regression was introduced in a certain commit (`4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4`), it would be beneficial to examine changes related to window expressions or the `annotate` method around this commit. Unfortunately, without direct access to the repository's commit history through these APIs, we can focus on the areas most likely affected based on the information provided.\n\nBy performing these searches, we aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of how Django's ORM handles window expressions and conditional statements within the `SELECT` clause and pinpoint where the regression might have been introduced."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into potential areas where the bug might exist and how the codebase's current behavior could be leading to the issue described. Here's an analysis based on the search results:\n\n### NotSupportedError Instances\n\nThe presence of `NotSupportedError` across multiple files indicates that Django has a mechanism to flag unsupported operations at various levels\u2014ranging from database backend specific operations (such as in `sqlite3`, `postgresql`, and `mysql` files) to more generic model and query operations. While the error is thrown in multiple contexts, it's particularly interesting in `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which deal directly with expressions like `Window`, and query compilation, respectively. The issue may stem from how Django's ORM detects and handles window functions during query compilation, mistakenly flagging a valid operation as unsupported due to misinterpretation of SQL standards or incorrect internal checks.\n\n### Window, Case, and When Classes\n\n- **Window Class**: The `Window` class in `expressions.py` allows users to define a window expression that can be applied over a set of rows. Given the issue's description, it's clear the class correctly supports creating window expressions. However, if Django internally mismanages the use of window functions in select clauses (where they should be valid), it could trigger an error. This could be a matter of how `Window` expressions are validated or compiled into SQL.\n\n- **Case and When Classes**: These classes allow constructing conditional expressions. Since they are used within an annotation in the issue's example, the handling of these expressions in conjunction with `Window` expressions could be related to the issue. If Django improperly assesses the use of window expressions within `Case`/`When`, it might lead to incorrectly raising a `NotSupportedError`.\n\n### Annotate Method\n\nThe `annotate` method adds extra data or aggregations to the returned objects of a query. The issue occurs within the scope of using `annotate` to apply a window function and a conditional expression. The method validates and processes annotations, ensuring they don't conflict with existing fields and that they are suitable for the query. The issue might be linked to how `annotate` or the underlying query compilation process validates the window expressions within these annotations, potentially not accounting for their valid use in select clauses as per SQL standards.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Relationship with the Bug\n\n1. **NotSupportedError Usage**: Intended to prevent operations that are genuinely unsupported by the backend or by Django's ORM. The relationship with the bug could be a too-aggressive check that misclassifies valid `Window` expressions in select clauses as unsupported.\n\n2. **Window, Case, and When Classes**: These classes should enable users to construct complex queries involving window functions and conditional logic. The intended behavior would allow for their use in annotations without incorrectly triggering errors, as long as the SQL standard allows for those operations in the contexts they are used (e.g., select clauses).\n\n3. **Annotate Method**: Meant to enrich querysets with additional data through annotations. Its handling of expressions, especially involving `Window` functions, should recognize that while window functions are prohibited in certain SQL clauses (like `WHERE`), they are perfectly valid in others (like `SELECT`). The bug could stem from a misunderstanding or incorrect implementation of this logic.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we should look deeper into how `Window` expressions are processed during query compilation (`sql/compiler.py` and `query.py` might be key points) and ensure that the ORM correctly distinguishes between the contexts where window functions are used. This might involve adjusting validations or checks within the `annotate` process or the SQL compilation stage to properly support window functions in select clauses."

The specific method wasn't identified from the given context, but this file is a likely location for the issue based on the error type and operation described. **Intended Behavior**: The code here should properly distinguish contexts where window functions are used, especially in `SELECT` clauses. The fix should ensure that window expressions within annotations are compiled into SQL without incorrectly raising a `NotSupportedError`. This adjustment must keep the validation against the use of window functions in prohibited clauses (like `WHERE`), while allowing them in `SELECT` clauses as per SQL standards.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `django/db/models/expressions.py`, Class: `Window`, Method: Potentially within the `as_sql` method or another method that contributes to the generation of the SQL part involving window functions. **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that when a `Window` expression is used within an `annotate` call, it is flagged in a way that prevents `NotSupportedError` from being incorrectly raised. This may involve adding additional checks or flags to indicate that the window expression is used in a supported context (i.e., within the `SELECT` clause) and should not be treated as an error.\n\nThese adjustments must be carefully implemented to avoid disrupting the existing functionality that correctly restricts unsupported uses of window functions. The goal is to refine the ORM's understanding and handling of window functions in line with SQL standards, particularly regarding their valid use in `SELECT` clauses."
