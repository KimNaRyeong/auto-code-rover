Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

To get context on the `_unregister_lookup` method as mentioned in the issue:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file('_unregister_lookup', 'django/db/models/query_utils.py')\n```\n\n2. To understand how the cache is cleared in the `register_lookup` method for comparison and potentially to mirror this in the `_unregister_lookup` method:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file('register_lookup', 'django/db/models/query_utils.py')\n```\n\n3. To assess the specific test mentioned in the issue that might require changes along with this bug fix:\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file('test_func_unique_constraint_lookups', 'django/tests/schema/tests.py')\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive background to address the issue effectively by showing existing implementations, which will be helpful for understanding the current mechanism and how it needs to be changed."
