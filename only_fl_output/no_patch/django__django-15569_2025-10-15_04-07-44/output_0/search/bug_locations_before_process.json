        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to clear the lookup cache after a lookup is unregistered. Currently, it removes a lookup from cls.class_lookups but does not clear cached lookups, leading to potential inconsistent state or stale lookup information. The intended behavior is to call cls._clear_cached_lookups() after the lookup is removed from cls.class_lookups. This change would align the behavior of _unregister_lookup with that of register_lookup, ensuring that any changes to lookup registration state are accurately reflected in the cache state, thus preserving the integrity and consistency of the system's functioning. This modification should be thread-safe and take into consideration the existing system logic to avoid introducing any new issues."
