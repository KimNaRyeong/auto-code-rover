Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results reveals the following about the issue and how it relates to the Django codebase:\n\n### 1. `_unregister_lookup` Method Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `_unregister_lookup` method within the `RegisterLookupMixin` class at `django/db/models/query_utils.py` line 212 removes a given lookup from the class lookups. This is primarily intended for use in tests since it is not thread-safe, as documentary comment lines 213-216 suggest. The method checks if a `lookup_name` is provided; if not, it uses the `lookup_name` attribute from the passed `lookup` object. Then, it removes the lookup identified by `lookup_name` from `cls.class_lookups`.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe issue described indicates that the `_unregister_lookup` method does not clear the lookup cache, which it should, similar to what the `register_lookup` method does. From the given context, it's clear that the method simply removes the lookup from `class_lookups` and does nothing about clearing the cache.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior would involve modifying `_unregister_lookup` to additionally clear the lookup cache (`_clear_cached_lookups()`) after a lookup is removed. This would ensure consistency in the behavior between registering and unregistering lookups and maintain the integrity of the lookup system, especially in dynamic conditions such as testing environments.\n\n### 2. `register_lookup` Method Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `register_lookup` method, found in the same mixin and file, adds a given lookup to the class lookups at line 202. If the `lookup_name` is not provided, it uses the `lookup_name` from the `lookup` object. It then ensures that the `class_lookups` dictionary is present in the class dictionary (`__dict__`). The lookup is added to this dictionary, and importantly, the method calls `_clear_cached_lookups()` to clear any cached lookups, which refreshes the state of lookups kept by the class.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe critical part here is the call to `_clear_cached_lookups()`, which is present in `register_lookup` but absent in `_unregister_lookup`. This discrepancy is the heart of the issue.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nGiven the issue description, mirroring the action of clearing the lookup cache as done in `register_lookup` within `_unregister_lookup` aligns with the intended behavior. Doing so would ensure that unregistering a lookup also resets the lookup cache, avoiding stale or incorrect state.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the missing context for the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` test in `django/tests/schema/tests.py`, it's clear we need to correct the path or re-attempt fetching this context. The correct approach might involve verifying the file path or name. However, as we couldn't find this file in the current search attempt, an alternative approach could be searching for a broader test file pattern or checking the test suite related to `RegisterLookupMixin` directly if the file name has changed or was inaccurately cited in the issue description.\n\n### Additional Search for Missing Context\n\nTo address the gap in the test file context, an alternative search might include:\n```python\nsearch_code('test_func_unique_constraint_lookups')\n```\nThis search would aim to fetch any test (regardless of its specific file location) that matches the mentioned test function name, providing insights into how this test is related to the lookup registration system and how it may need to be adjusted following the proposed changes."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Currently, it removes a lookup from `cls.class_lookups` but does not clear cached lookups, leading to potential inconsistent state or stale lookup information. The intended behavior is to call `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` after the lookup is removed from `cls.class_lookups`. This change would align the behavior of `_unregister_lookup` with that of `register_lookup`, ensuring that any changes to lookup registration state are accurately reflected in the cache state, thus preserving the integrity and consistency of the system's functioning. This modification should be thread-safe and take into consideration the existing system logic to avoid introducing any new issues."
