Invalid XML schema for <properties> tags in JUnit reports 
The problem:

JUnit breaks when it reads an XML generated by pytest if plugins make use of  `record-property`. This behavior happens with newer versions of  hypothesis (https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/1935).

```
[xUnit] [ERROR] - The result file '/somewhere/tests/pytests.xml' for the metric 'JUnit' is not valid. The result file has been skipped.
```

In fact, as already mentioned in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1126#issuecomment-484581283,  `record-property` is adding `<properties>` inside `<testcase>` which seems to be wrong (it should be inside `<testsuite>`). See: https://github.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema/blob/master/JUnit.xsd .

It happens with all junit families.

Reproducing:

```
$ pip list

I was trying to create a PR to fix this, but when I saw https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/7dcd9bf5add337686ec6f2ee81b24e8424319dba/src/_pytest/junitxml.py code I realized that what is needed to do could have more implications that I though. I think that nobody uses this feature with JUnit (as it breaks) and removing that is something to think about.
