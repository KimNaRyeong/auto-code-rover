The intended adjustment might involve ensuring the decimal values are cast to a string or a numeric type recognized by SQLite as a decimal, especially in Case or ExpressionWrapper contexts, to prevent unintended type conversion that leads to comparison failures."

This could involve adding appropriate type casts or adjusting the SQL syntax to prevent misinterpretation.
