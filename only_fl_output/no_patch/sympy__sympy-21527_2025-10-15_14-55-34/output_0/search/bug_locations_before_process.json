        "intended_behavior": "The `linsolve` method should accurately handle and evaluate systems of equations with numerical coefficients that are very close to each other. Specifically, when solving systems where the equations imply a linear dependency (like y = x and y = k * x with k very close to 1), the method should consistently return a solution set that reflects the numerical precision and stability, possibly acknowledging the nearly singular or conditionally stable nature of the matrix involved. The fix should ensure that `linsolve` does not return spurious or misleading solutions (such as the finite set of (0,0) or an unexpected parametric solution) due to floating-point arithmetic inaccuracies or failures in detecting underdetermined systems. The intended fix should preserve the method's ability to solve both underdetermined and overdetermined systems of linear equations, across all supported input formats, without introducing regressions in performance or accuracy for systems not affected by this issue."
