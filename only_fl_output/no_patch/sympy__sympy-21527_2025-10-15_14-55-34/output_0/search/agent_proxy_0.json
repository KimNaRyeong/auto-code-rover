            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to first understand how the `linsolve` function operates and the classes and methods it uses in solving systems of linear equations. The issue mentioned involves handling of equations and symbols, suggesting that the problem might lie in how equations are simplified or solved numerically when coefficients are very close to each other. Based on this, we'll need to look into the implementation of `linsolve`, and potentially the classes that represent equations and symbols, as well as any related numerical simplification or solving strategies employed.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for the `linsolve` method to understand how it's implemented: `search_method('linsolve')`\n2. Search for the `Eq` class to see how equations are structured: `search_class('Eq')`\n3. Search for the `symbols` method to understand how symbols are created and handled: `search_method('symbols')`\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the components involved in the issue."
