        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that when an ExpressionWrapper is used to combine expressions without an explicitly set output_field, it can still resolve to a compatible output field that reflects the intended computation or aggregation's result type. The resolution process should account for mixed types (e.g., IntegerField and AutoField) by providing a sensible default output_field type (like FloatField for division operations) or by improving error messaging to guide the user in explicitly setting an appropriate output_field when automatic resolution is not possible. The approach should preserve compatibility with expressions where the output type can be clearly inferred."

        "intended_behavior": "This constructor should include enhanced validation or inference logic to handle or anticipate cases where the output_field might need more clarification due to the combined use of different field types. If automatic resolution of output_field is feasible based on common patterns (e.g., arithmetic operations between integer fields defaulting to a float output), such logic could be incorporated. Alternatively, if resolution is not straightforward, improved guidance for the developer on the need to explicitly declare an output_field in complex scenarios could be provided. This would ensure that developers have a clear path toward resolving type ambiguities in complex expressions, retaining the intended versatility of ExpressionWrapper for a wide array of use cases."
