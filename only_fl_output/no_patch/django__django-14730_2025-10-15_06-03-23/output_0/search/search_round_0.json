However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context about how `ManyToManyField` is implemented and managed within the codebase, specifically focusing on how the `symmetrical` argument and `related_name` are processed. The following information would be crucial:\n\n1. Definition and implementation of `ManyToManyField` class.\n2. Any method that handles or references the `related_name` attribute in the context of `ManyToManyField`.\n3. Any method or logic that checks or uses the `symmetrical` attribute of `ManyToManyField`.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n- `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`: To find the class definition and its file location within the codebase.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_field\", \"ManyToManyField\")`: Assuming `add_field` might be a method that deals with adding fields including handling attributes like `related_name` and `symmetrical`.\n- `search_code(\"symmetrical\")`: To find code snippets where the `symmetrical` attribute is being checked or used, giving broader context outside of the `ManyToManyField` implementation.\n- `search_code(\"related_name\")`: To find code snippets where the `related_name` attribute is specifically referenced or manipulated, which might include validations or error handling that could be adapted or improved to address the issue."
