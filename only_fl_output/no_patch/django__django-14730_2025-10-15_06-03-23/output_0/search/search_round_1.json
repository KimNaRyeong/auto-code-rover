        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context from the `ManyToManyField` implementation and its related snippets to understand the current mechanism and to figure out how it relates to the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of `ManyToManyField` Implementation\n\nThe `ManyToManyField` class, as retrieved, has an `__init__` method where both `symmetrical` and `related_name` parameters are accepted. This is crucial since the issue revolves around these parameters\u2014specifically, raising an error when `related_name` is defined in cases where `symmetrical` is `True` or it's a self-referential `ManyToMany` relationship.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `ManyToManyField` class defines the behavior and properties of many-to-many relationships in the Django ORM. This includes handling relationships through an intermediary table, providing options for customizing table names (`db_table`), and defining whether a relationship is symmetrical (mainly important for self-referential models).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   This class is at the center of the reported issue. The handling (or lack thereof) of the `related_name` parameter in symmetrical relationships\u2014or when not explicitly handled\u2014is the source of confusion for developers. Currently, there seems to be no mechanism in the `__init__` method or elsewhere in the class that raises an error when `related_name` is set in conditions where it should not be, i.e., when `symmetrical=True` or in self-referential many-to-many relationships.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would involve introducing validation logic within either the `__init__` method or a relevant configuration method (like `contribute_to_class` or a validation-specific method invoked therein) to check if a `related_name` is specified while `symmetrical` is `True` or when the relationship is self-referential. Upon detection, an appropriate error should be raised to inform the developer directly, avoiding confusion and potential misconfiguration.\n\n### Next Steps in Analysis\n\nGiven the findings:\n\n1. It's clear we might need to delve into methods related to field initialization and validation within the `ManyToManyField` class or its parent classes. Methods such as `contribute_to_class` and the listed check methods (`_check_unique`, `_check_relationship_model`, etc.) should be examined to see where this validation could be effectively introduced.\n\n2. Since the specific method `add_field` was not found, it hints that the process of field addition and configuration does not rely on a method with that name within the `ManyToManyField` context. This calls for a deeper look into methods related to field setup and validation within `ManyToManyField` or its superclass, `RelatedField`.\n\n3. The search results for code snippets containing \"symmetrical\" and \"related_name\" across various files indicate widespread usage and potential validation points outside the `ManyToManyField` class itself. Specifically, files like `related_descriptors.py` and `reverse_related.py` might contain logic that examines these attributes for configuration or runtime operations, which could inform where and how to introduce the proposed validation.\n\n4. Given the widespread references to `related_name`, a next step could involve examining specific occurrences in `related.py` (which has the highest match count) to understand how `related_name` is currently validated or processed within the context of many-to-many relationships. This could offer insight into existing patterns for attribute validation that the solution could mimic or extend.\n\nThe next immediate action, based on this analysis, could be to explore methods within `ManyToManyField` and potentially its superclass or related management files, focusing on initialization and validation logic where the proposed changes could logically reside."

Bug Location 1:\n   - File: django/db/models/fields/related.py\n   - Class: ManyToManyField\n   - Method: __init__\n   - Intended Behavior: Within the `__init__` method, introduce a validation check to determine if `related_name` is provided while a symmetrical relationship is intended (either because `symmetrical=True` is explicitly stated or it's inferred from a self-referential relationship). If so, raise an appropriate Django-specific error (e.g., `ValueError` or a more specific custom error type) to alert the developer that `related_name` should not be used in this context. This validation should not impede other valid usages of `related_name` in non-symmetrical many-to-many relationships. The validation logic could be something like:\n\n   ```python\n   if symmetrical and related_name is not None:\n       raise ValueError(\"You cannot use 'related_name' with a symmetrical ManyToManyField.\")\n   ```\n\n   This check should be early in the method to prevent any processing assuming an invalid state. This preserves the existing functionality for all valid configurations of `ManyToManyField` while providing immediate feedback for a misconfiguration specific to the issue described.\n\nBug Location 2:\n   - File: django/db/models/fields/related.py\n   - Class: ManyToManyField\n   - Intended Behavior: If additional processing or validation related to `related_name` and `symmetrical` occurs outside of the `__init__` method (possibly in methods like `contribute_to_class` or any custom validation checks), ensure that the implemented validation logic from `__init__` is either extended to or considered in those contexts as well. This ensures that the intended behavior is consistent across the class\u2019s usage, preventing any oversight that might arise from processing these attributes separately in different method calls.\n\nGiven the existing implementation of `ManyToManyField` and the requirement from the issue, introducing this targeted validation should address the confusion around the use of `related_name` in symmetrical many-to-many relationships without altering other functionality."
