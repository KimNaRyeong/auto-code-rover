The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, it's crucial to understand how Sphinx handles default argument values during the documentation generation process, especially for functions. Since the issue specifically mentions that Sphinx is changing the number system from hexadecimal to decimal for function default arguments in the documentation, we should focus on locating the part of the Sphinx code that is responsible for parsing and rendering these default arguments in the documentation.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls seem most relevant to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the Sphinx function or method that handles the rendering of function signatures in documentation.** This could be a method that specifically processes function definitions or their arguments. Since Sphinx is extensible, it might be done in a part of the code related to parsing docstrings or generating HTML from them. Unfortunately, without prior knowledge of the exact method or class names Sphinx uses for this functionality, we need to guess based on typical naming conventions or roles, such as methods that might be involved in rendering or parsing. However, a likely function name could be involved in rendering or parsing docstrings, like `render_function_signature` or `parse_function_arguments`.\n   \n2. **Search for code that deals with formatting or converting number systems.** This might not directly lead to the exact location but could give clues if there is a common utility or formatting function that is used across the project for such purposes.\n\nGiven the above considerations, let's start with some educated guesses and broader searches:\n\n- **search_method:** This will be useful if there is a method named in a way that obviously suggests its involvement in rendering function signatures or processing their arguments. However, without specific names to start with, we might skip this step.\n  \n- **search_code:** Searching for code snippets related to default argument processing or function signature rendering. We might look for snippets that mention keywords like \"default\", \"arguments\", \"hexadecimal\", \"decimal\", etc., to find relevant sections.\n\nFor a more fine-grained approach, if we had the name of the file or the class where this behavior is most likely implemented, we could use more targeted searches like `search_class_in_file` or `search_method_in_file`.\n\nBased on the generic approach and the information needs, I will begin with:\n\n- **search_code(\"default argument\")**: This aims to find any code snippets that deal with handling default arguments, which might be directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n- **search_code(\"hexadecimal\")**: To find code that specifically mentions or deals with hexadecimal values, which could lead us to the functionality that handles number system conversions or representations in Sphinx."
