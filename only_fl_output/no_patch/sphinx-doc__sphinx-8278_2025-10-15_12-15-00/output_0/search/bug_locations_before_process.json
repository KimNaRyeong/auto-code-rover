        "intended_behavior": "The function `_pseudo_parse_arglist` needs to be updated or complemented with additional logic to accurately detect and retain the numeral system (e.g., hexadecimal, binary) of default argument values specified in function signatures. When parsing these signatures, instead of generically splitting and stripping arguments, the function should: Distinguish between literal types, specifically identifying numeric literals that are presented in hexadecimal (or other non-decimal systems) formats. Preserve the original representation (including the numeral system) of these literals when constructing the `paramlist` structure that will be used for documentation generation. Ensure that this preserved format is correctly reflected in the generated documentation, thereby maintaining the readability and intention behind the use of specific numeral systems (like hexadecimal for color codes). This updated behavior will require parsing enhancements to recognize numeric literals and potentially new data structures or properties within the `addnodes.desc_parameterlist()` or related classes to hold this formatting information through to the documentation rendering phase. Thus, the code must maintain its existing functionality for argument parsing while adding this new layer of numeral system awareness and preservation. This approach will resolve the issue by ensuring that hexadecimal and other non-decimal default values are accurately represented in Sphinx-generated documentation, aligning with developer expectations and the source code's original clarity."
