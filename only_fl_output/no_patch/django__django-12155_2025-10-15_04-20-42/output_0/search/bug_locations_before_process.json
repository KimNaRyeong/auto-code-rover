        "intended_behavior": "The `trim_docstring` method should preserve its functionality of uniformly trimming leading/trailing whitespace from docstrings. However, to resolve the issue, it should adjust the way it calculates indentation to exclude the first line from the indentation calculation. This ensures that docstrings with text starting from the first line are handled correctly. The intended behavior is to modify the `indent` calculation line to:\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n```\nThis change will calculate the minimum indentation level based on lines other than the first, addressing the issue while maintaining the method's overall purpose of trimming docstring indentation uniformly."
