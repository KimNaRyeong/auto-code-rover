            "content": "To address the issue described, which involves error handling with docstrings in the context of rendering documentation, possibly within a Django project using `docutils`, I will need to gather more code context around the specific problem areas mentioned in the issue. The issue mentions \"trim_docstring\" function or method, which seems to be central to the problem of handling docstrings that do not start with an empty line.\n\nGiven the information, the following API calls are necessary to collect sufficient context:\n\n1. **Search for the \"trim_docstring\" method:** Since the issue revolves around how docstrings are treated, and specifically mentions an issue in the `trim_docstring` method, it's crucial to find this method to understand how it's currently implemented. This would involve searching for the method across the entire codebase to locate its definition and any relevant usage:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"trim_docstring\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for code mentioning \"default-role\":** The issue description mentions an error related to a \"default-role\" directive, which suggests that this piece of code or documentation syntax might be related to the handling of docstrings or settings for `docutils`. Searching for this string could provide insight into how and where `default-role` is used or set in the project:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\".. default-role::\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for the error message:** To understand where the error message \"Error in \"default-role\" directive: no content permitted.\" is generated and under what conditions, it would be useful to identify any part of the codebase that throws or handles this specific error. This could offer a broader view of the error handling logic:\n\n```python\nsearch_code('Error in \"default-role\" directive: no content permitted.')\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of where and how the issue arises in the project, including the function mentioned in the issue, where the problematic directive is used or defined, and any error handling related to the problem. With this information, it would be possible to proceed with analyzing the code and forming a solution to the reported bug."
