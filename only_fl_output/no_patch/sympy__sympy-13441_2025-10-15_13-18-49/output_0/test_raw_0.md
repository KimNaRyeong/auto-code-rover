Certainly! Here's a `reproducer.py` file that attempts to reproduce the described issue. This script specifically targets the slowdown encountered with the `count_ops` functionality in the context of large expressions, as evident from the stack trace provided.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from pydy.models import n_link_pendulum_on_cart
    import sympy as sp
    import time

    try:
        # Adjust the number of pendulums to test the threshold where the issue becomes apparent
        sys = n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)
        x_dot = sys.eom_method.rhs()
        
        start_time = time.time()
        jac = x_dot.jacobian(sys.states)
        duration = time.time() - start_time

        # Assert to check if the operation takes an unusually long time.
        # The threshold (e.g., 10 seconds) needs tuning based on expected performance benchmarks.
        assert duration < 10, "Operation took longer than expected."
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    print("If you're seeing this message without an AssertionError above, the issue is likely resolved.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Follow these steps to utilize this script:

1. Ensure that you have the PyDy and SymPy libraries installed in your environment. If not, you can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install pydy sympy
   ```
2. Save the above script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
3. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```
   python3 reproducer.py
   ```

This script will attempt to reproduce the slow performance issue with the `count_ops` functionality when invoked through the `jacobian` method on large systems, as described. An `AssertionError` signifies that the issue is present, and it should print a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes. Exiting with code 0 indicates the issue has been resolved or did not occur.
