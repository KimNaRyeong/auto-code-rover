Based on the feedback, it appears that there might be a misunderstanding either in the scripting environment setup or in testing the Python script provided. However, I noticed an error in my previous output handling that would result in a `NameError` due to calling `sys.exit(1)` after a module import failure without importing `sys`. Let's fix this and ensure proper module import and exception handling in our adjusted `reproducer.py` script.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from pydy.models import n_link_pendulum_on_cart
        import time

        start_time = time.time()
        sys_model = n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)  # Creating a model with 4 pendulums

        x_dot = sys_model.eom_method.rhs()
        jac = x_dot.jacobian(sys_model.states)  # Operation suspected to be slow

        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        print("Execution time: ", execution_time)
        
        # Check if execution time is unexpectedly long
        assert execution_time < 180, "Execution takes unexpectedly too long, indicating a potential issue."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Assertion Error:", e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code when an assertion fails
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit without error when execution completes successfully
```

Ensure that the Python environment has the `pydy` package installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using a package manager like `pip`:

```bash
pip install pydy
```

This script is designed to attempt the provided operation and checks if it takes an unexpected amount of time, raising an `AssertionError` when it does. The try-except block is intended to catch any unexpected exceptions and print a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating the issue is present, the script attempts to exit with code 1. Otherwise, if no exception is raised and the script completes successfully, it exits with code 0.
