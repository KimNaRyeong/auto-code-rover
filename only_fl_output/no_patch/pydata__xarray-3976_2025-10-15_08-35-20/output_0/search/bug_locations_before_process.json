Given that in-place addition (`A += B`) should ideally have the same effect as out-of-place addition (`A = A + B`), the code should be modified to perform a pre-check for coordinate alignment, and if the coordinates are not aligned, either align them (if feasible without ambiguity) or raise an exception that clearly instructs the user how to manually align the coordinates before performing the in-place operation."

        "intended_behavior": "While this function correctly merges coordinates without aligning for specific use cases, there should be an explicit check or a flag that allows it to handle the scenario of in-place operations differently. Specifically, it should support a mode where alignment errors prompt a validation step that either corrects misalignments (when possible) or raises a clear error message. This adjustment would ensure that operations that inherently require coordinate alignment, like `A += B`, are either executed correctly or provide clear guidance to the user on the necessity of manual alignment before the operation."
