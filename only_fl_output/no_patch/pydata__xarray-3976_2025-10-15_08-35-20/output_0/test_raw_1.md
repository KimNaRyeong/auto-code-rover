Based on the error you encountered during the test execution and taking into account the requirements for a correct `reproducer.py`, I will craft a script that specifically aims to trigger and catch the expected issue related to in-place addition of `xarray` DataArrays having the same coordinates but in a different order. This version ensures that the operation encountering the issue is enclosed in a try-except block to catch and manage the exception appropriately.

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def try_inplace_addition():
    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        A += B
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed with an error") from e

    print("No issues with in-place addition.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try_inplace_addition()
```

In this script:

1. Two `xarray.DataArray`s `A` and `B` are created with dimensions based on shuffled ranges of `n`. This guarantees that while they share the same set of coordinates, those coordinates are ordered differently between `A` and `B`.
2. The in-place addition `A += B` might fail due to the coordinate order issue described, and an exception might be thrown.
3. If an exception occurs, it is caught, and the `print_stacktrace` function is called to print detailed traceback information. Then, an `AssertionError` is raised to explicitly mark the test as failed due to the encountered issue.
4. If no exception occurs, indicating the issue might be resolved or not present, a success message is printed to stdout.

This Python script is designed to be executed standalone and will clearly indicate whether the issue occurs or not, in accordance to the behavior detailed in the original error description.
