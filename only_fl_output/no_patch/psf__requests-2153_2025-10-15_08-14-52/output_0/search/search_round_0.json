        "content": "<issue>Uncaught socket.timeout during post\nHallo requests devs (and thanks for an awesome lib)\nDuring a specific `requests.post` I most of the time get a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` (on timeouts) but I also sometimes get a `socket.timeout` exception. Since there is a requests exception for it, I assume that the socket exception was supposed to be caught and the requests one raise instead. The full stack trace is:\n``` python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 132, in <module>\ntest_stuff()\nFile \"test.py\", line 113, in test_stuff\nbrowse_recursively()\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 101, in browse_recursively\nfor new_item in wimp.browse(item):\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 207, in browse\nresponse = post(self._url, headers, body)\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 40, in post\nout = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=body, timeout=1.0)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 87, in post\nreturn request('post', url, data=data, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 44, in request\nreturn session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 279, in request\nresp = self.send(prep, stream=stream, timeout=timeout, verify=verify, cert=cert, proxies=proxies)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 374, in send\nr = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py\", line 222, in send\nr.content\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 550, in content\nself._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/utils.py\", line 363, in stream_decompress\nfor chunk in iterator:\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 496, in generate\nchunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 146, in read\nreturn self._fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 567, in read\ns = self.fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 380, in read\ndata = self._sock.recv(left)\nsocket.timeout: timed out\n```\nThe development is for a plugin for the music service Wimp for the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) project, which means that I could post code to reproduce, but you will not be able to run it without a Sonos speaker and a Wimp subscription. I understand if this difficulty to reproduce may mean that you cannot work with this issue.\nThanks in advance Kenneth\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, I will use the following search API calls based on the stack trace and information provided in the issue description:\n\n1. Search for the `post` method within the `soco/plugins/wimp.py` file to understand how it's implemented and if there's a specific reason it's not catching `socket.timeout` exceptions.\n2. Retrieve code around the line mentioned in the stack trace within the `requests/api.py` to see how the `post` method in the Requests library is structured, as this is likely where any modifications or investigations would need to begin to ensure `socket.timeout` gets correctly caught and re-raised as a `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.\n3. Since the actual timeout occurs deep within the Requests and urllib3 libraries (`urllib3/response.py` and `socket.py`), we want to look at how Requests and urllib3 are handling timeouts, but given our scope, it's more practical to focus on how our wimp plugin could better handle or intercept these errors.\n\nBased on this, here are the specific API calls I would make:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"post\", \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\")`\n- `get_code_around_line(\"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", 87, 5)`\n\nThese calls aim to provide us with a direct look into how the `post` function is being handled within the wimp plugin and how the `post` call in the Requests library is structured around the line where the error might initiate."
