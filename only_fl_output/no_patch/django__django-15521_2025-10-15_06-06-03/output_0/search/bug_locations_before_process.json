        "intended_behavior": "The code responsible for validating locales in `makemessages.py` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle locale codes that include a variant after the country code, such as `nl-nl-x-informal`. Instead of rejecting these codes with an error suggesting an incorrect format, the code should: Utilize the logic similar to the `to_locale` method, which correctly parses and transforms language codes into locale names, to validate custom locales. Ensure that custom or extended locale strings (with additional descriptors beyond the primary language-sublanguage structure) are accepted and correctly mapped to their corresponding directory structures within the Django project. This adjustment allows for the inclusion of informal or variant language codes and supports the creation and updating of `.po` files in directories named accordingly, such as `nl_NL-x-informal`. The validation logic should be reviewed and possibly refactored to extend the straightforward language-country code parsing to accommodate \"-x-\" tagged variants, ensuring these are correctly interpreted as valid locales. Preserve existing functionality for standard locale codes while extending support for non-standard, project-specific locale variants. This ensures that developers can utilize Django\u2019s internationalization frameworks even with highly customized locale settings."
