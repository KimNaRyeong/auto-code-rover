        # to manually check for the absence of the error message.

        # with an assertion in this context since it occurs within matplotlib's event loop.

### Note
This script is designed to execute the provided code block which causes the matplotlib library to display a plot. Since the specific issue involves interaction with the GUI (hovering mouse over the plot to see if math domain errors are outputted to the console), there is no straightforward way to programmatically assert whether the issue occurs within this script.

Instead, an instruction is printed for the user to manually verify if the error messages are displayed in the console upon hovering the mouse over the imshow plot. If exceptions were to disrupt the functionality of the script significantly, it catches and prints them, but the specific issue at hand doesn't lend itself to being caught as an exception this way.
