    # but leads to console error outputs upon user interaction. Unfortunately, we can't simulate this
    # precise interaction and catch its resulting errors directly within a Python script designed like this one.
    # Therefore, the approach taken here is somewhat unconventional and doesn't fit well with the problem described.

### Note:
- This script provides a framework where ordinarily, a bug that causes an exception could be caught and assertions could be made based on the behavior. However, the specific issue described involves GUI interaction and outputs errors to the console rather than throwing exceptions that can be caught in a straightforward manner within the script. 
- The comments within the script and the `print` messages guide towards manual verification, which remains necessary due to the nature of the issue.
