What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\n```\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\nestimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\nparam_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\n)\nrs.fit(X, y)\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\n```\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue regarding capturing the refit time of the best model in `BaseSearchCV`, I would use the following search API calls based on the given descriptions in the issue:\n\n1. To find where the `BaseSearchCV` class is defined, as this is likely the place we need to modify to add the `refit_time_` attribute:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseSearchCV\")`\n\n2. Since the `fit` method of `BaseSearchCV` or a derived class (like `GridSearchCV`) is where models are fitted and the best model is refitted, we'd want to look at its implementation. Knowing the file would allow us to search within it:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"BaseSearchCV\")`\n\n3. The issue mentions the problem arises more specifically when `n_jobs != 1`, which hints at parallel processing. It might be useful to understand how this is implemented, so searching for `n_jobs` within the class could give us hints on where parallel processing is handled:\n   - `search_code_in_class(\"n_jobs\", \"BaseSearchCV\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to give us a good starting point to understand where and how to implement the `refit_time_` attribute to capture the time it takes to refit the best estimator."

Since the `fit` method is essential for understanding how the refitting process is implemented, let's search for its implementation. The exact class and file will depend on the results from the previous step, so initially, let's search across the whole codebase:\n   - `search_method(\"fit\")`\n\n3. The issue description focuses on capturing the time specifically when `n_jobs != 1` for parallel processing scenarios. Let's search for the keyword `n_jobs` within the codebase to understand its usage contexts, especially in relation to fitting and refitting models:\n   - `search_code(\"n_jobs\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a foundational context for implementing the `refit_time_` attribute in the correct location within the `BaseSearchCV` class or its fitting process."
