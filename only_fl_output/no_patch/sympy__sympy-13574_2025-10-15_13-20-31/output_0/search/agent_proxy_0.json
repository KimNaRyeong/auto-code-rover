Based on the issue description, we will focus on how `randMatrix` handles the `symmetric` and `percent` parameters. The following API calls could provide the necessary insights:\n\n1. `search_method(\"randMatrix\")`: To find the locations and definitions of the `randMatrix` function across the project, so we can understand its implementation and parameter handling.\n2. `search_code(\"symmetric=True\")`: To locate the usage of the `symmetric` parameter within the codebase, this might bring up the parts of the code most relevant to the issue, including potentially different implementations or conditional logic that handles this parameter.\n3. `search_code(\"percent=\")`: By understanding how the `percent` parameter is being used, especially in conjunction with `symmetric=True`, we can identify potentially flawed logic or incorrect implementations.\n\nThese searches will give us an overview of where and how `randMatrix`, `symmetric`, and `percent` are involved in the code, and identify possible sources of the bug mentioned in the issue."
