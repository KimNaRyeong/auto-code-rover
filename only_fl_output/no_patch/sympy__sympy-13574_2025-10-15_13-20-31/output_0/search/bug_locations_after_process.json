        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `randMatrix` function should ensure that when generating a symmetric matrix with a `percent` parameter less than 100, it maintains symmetry even after reducing the density of non-zero elements. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic that sets elements to zero and shuffles the matrix to consider the matrix's symmetry. Specifically, for a symmetric matrix, instead of applying shuffling to the entire 1D representation of the matrix (`m._mat`), the algorithm should:\n\n- Identify positions (i, j) for non-zero elements in a way that respects the `percent` parameter and ensures that if `(i, j)` is chosen to be non-zero, then `(j, i)` is also chosen to be non-zero, thereby maintaining symmetry.\n- Fill the identified positions with random numbers as currently being done, and the rest should be set to zero.\n- Avoid blind shuffling that can disrupt the symmetry established. If any shuffling is needed, it should be done in a way that pairs of symmetric positions are moved together, ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.\n\nThis modification preserves the existing functionality of generating random matrices with specific characteristics (density of non-zero elements, symmetric property) while fixing the reported issue with the symmetry of sparse (percent < 100) matrices."
