Consider the following examples:\r\n\r\n' ' ' \r\nIn [1]: import sympy\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from sympy.matrices import randMatrix\r\n\r\nIn [3]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=1)\r\nOut[3]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[13, 61, 13],\r\n[59, 29, 59],\r\n[88, 13, 61]])\r\n\r\nIn [4]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=50)\r\nOut[4]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[90, 60,  0],\r\n[ 0,  0,  0],\r\n[60, 59, 25]])\r\n\r\nIn [7]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=99)\r\nOut[7]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[0, 0, 19],\r\n[0, 0,  0],\r\n[0, 0,  0]])\r\n\r\nIn [9]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=0)\r\nOut[9]: \r\nMatrix([\r\n[78, 78, 61],\r\n[68,  8, 61],\r\n[22, 68,  8]])\r\n' ' ' \r\n\r\nAlso, the documentation says `If percent is less than 100 then only approximately the given percentage of elements will be non-zero.`, but the behaviour is the opposite. Setting it to 100 (default) produces the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens with both the released version from pypi and git master.\n"
