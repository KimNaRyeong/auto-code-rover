Based on the feedback, it seems that the test did reproduce the issue, but perhaps the instructions were misunderstood. The goal now is to carefully construct a script that explicitly checks for symmetry and reports precisely when it fails to achieve that.

Given the updated requirements, let's include more detailed checks for symmetry and adjust the script accordingly, clarifying the output messages and ensuring any exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def is_symmetric(matrix):
    return matrix == matrix.T

def test_randMatrix_symmetric_sparse_matrices():
    from sympy.matrices import randMatrix
    try:
        test_pass = True
        for percent in [1, 50, 99, 0]:
            matrix = randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=percent)
            if not is_symmetric(matrix):
                test_pass = False
                print(f"Matrix not symmetric at percent={percent}:")
                print(matrix)
                break  # Break on the first failure
        assert test_pass, "Some matrices were not symmetric as expected."

        if test_pass:
            print("All matrices are symmetric as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_randMatrix_symmetric_sparse_matrices()
```

This script introduces a loop to test various `percent` values more systematically, checking if the generated matrix is symmetric at each step. The `is_symmetric` function is a more explicit and direct approach to checking the matrices. If any matrix fails this symmetry check, the script reports the specific `percent` value that caused the issue. This should ensure that the script can correctly identify any failures to generate symmetric matrices according to the specified `percent` parameter value.
