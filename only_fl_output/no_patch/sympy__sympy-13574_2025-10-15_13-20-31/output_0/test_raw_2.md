Based on your request, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script to explicitly check for symmetric matrices and handle the issue with the `randMatrix` function in a more structured manner. This updated script will properly use the `print_stacktrace` function to output the exception's stack trace when an `AssertionError` is caught.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def is_matrix_symmetric(matrix):
    """Check if a given matrix is symmetric."""
    return all(matrix[i, j] == matrix[j, i] for i in range(matrix.rows) for j in range(matrix.cols))

def main():
    from sympy.matrices import randMatrix

    # Check various percent values to verify symmetry
    for percent in [100, 50, 99, 1, 0]:  # Including 100 and 0 for edge cases
        matrix = randMatrix(4, symmetric=True, percent=percent)  # Use 4x4 matrix for better sample
        if not is_matrix_symmetric(matrix):
            error_message = f"Matrix is not symmetric at percent={percent}:\n{matrix}"
            raise AssertionError(error_message)

    print("All generated matrices are symmetric as expected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script attempts to clarify the mechanism for identifying and reporting issues with the generation of symmetric matrices via the `randMatrix` function, specifically focusing on the `percent` parameter's impact on the result's symmetry. It now includes an edge case check for both 100% and 0% to ensure full coverage. Moreover, the `is_matrix_symmetric` function provides a more generalized method of verifying symmetry across the whole matrix, independent of its size.
