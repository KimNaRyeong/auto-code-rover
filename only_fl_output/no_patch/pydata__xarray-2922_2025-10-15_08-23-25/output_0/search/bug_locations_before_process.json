        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, we will develop and integrate a new method, `average`, into the `Dataset` class. This method will achieve the following: Allow users to calculate the weighted average of the dataset across specified dimensions. If no dimension is specified, the average should be calculated across all dimensions. Support specifying weights for different dimensions, which is particularly useful for geospatial data where area or volume might influence the average calculation. Ensure that the method can gracefully handle missing data (NaN values), potentially ignoring them or treating them according to a specified parameter. The function\u2019s API should allow for flexibility in usage, such as specifying the dimension(s) over which the average should be taken and whether the calculation should skip NaN values. Preserve the existing dataset's properties and attributes unless explicitly altered by the operation. This implies that the resulting dataset after the average calculation should retain its coordinate system and metadata, as much as applicable. Be optimized for performance to handle large datasets efficiently, making use of xarray\u2019s and underlying libraries\u2019 (like NumPy or Dask) capabilities to minimize memory footprint and computational time."
