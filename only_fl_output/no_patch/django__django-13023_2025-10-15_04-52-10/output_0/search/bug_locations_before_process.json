If such types are detected, the method should raise a `ValidationError` instead of allowing a `TypeError` to occur. This preserves the method's original intent to only convert compatible types to `Decimal`, and provides clearer, more actionable feedback when unsupported types are encountered."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, in the context of forms, the `to_python` method requires modification to prevent `TypeError` when encountering types that are unsuitable for conversion to `Decimal`. Before any conversion logic, there should be an explicit check for these types, and upon encountering them, a `ValidationError` should be raised. This approach ensures that the form validation process remains robust and user-friendly, guiding developers towards correcting field values without delving into unexpected `TypeError` diagnostics."
