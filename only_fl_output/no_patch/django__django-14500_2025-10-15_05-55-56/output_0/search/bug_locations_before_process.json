        "intended_behavior": "The `unapply_migration` method should ensure that when a squashed migration is unapplied, the squashed migration itself is also marked as unapplied in addition to the migrations it replaces. Currently, the method correctly handles marking each of the replaced migrations as unapplied but does not explicitly ensure that the squashed migration is marked as unapplied in scenarios where the replaced migrations files are still present. To resolve the issue, this method needs to be modified or extended to include a condition that checks if the migration being unapplied is a squashed migration and, if so, ensure that this squashed migration is also recorded as unapplied. This could involve adding a check after the loop that handles the `migration.replaces` list (if it exists), specifically to cover the case where the squashed migration itself is not properly marked. The existing functionality of recording each replaced migration as unapplied should be preserved, and additional logic should only extend to cover the squashed migration itself."
