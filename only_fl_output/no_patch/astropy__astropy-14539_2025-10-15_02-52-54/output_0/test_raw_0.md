Certainly, here's how you could structure `reproducer.py` to automate the reproduction of the issue described, including the part where it should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is encountered, and make use of the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clear error reporting:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_fits_diff_issue():
    from astropy.io import fits

    # Setup a FITS file with a variable-length array column
    col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
    hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
    hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

    # Attempt to compare the file to itself and assert if identical
    diff_result = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits')
    try:
        assert diff_result.identical, "Files differ when they should not"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_fits_diff_issue()
        print("Test completed successfully - no issue found.")
    except AssertionError:
        # Exit with code 0 to indicate the script completed without uncaught exceptions,
        # but the AssertionError indicates the issue is present.
        exit(0)
```

This script does the following:
- Defines `print_stacktrace` as given.
- Sets up a simple test case where it creates a FITS file with a variable-length array column and writes it to disk.
- Uses `fits.FITSDiff` to compare the file against itself and checks if it's considered identical.
- If the file is not considered identical, an `AssertionError` is raised, and `print_stacktrace` is called to provide a clear traceback.
- If the script encounters an `AssertionError`, it catches it and exits with status code 0, indicating the script ran to completion but the issue was encountered as expected.
