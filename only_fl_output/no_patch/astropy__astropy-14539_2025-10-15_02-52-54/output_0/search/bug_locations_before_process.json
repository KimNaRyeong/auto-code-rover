        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to properly handle comparisons of VLAs (variable-length arrays). When comparing columns formatted with 'P' (a marker for VLAs in the FITS standard), the method must ensure that it correctly accounts for the possibility of variable-sized arrays within the same column. The comparison should be able to identify when two VLAs are structurally identical (i.e., each corresponding element within the VLA should have the same length and content). It is critical that this logic preserves the accuracy of comparisons for other data types and configurations, maintaining the method's overall functionality while ensuring VLAs are correctly handled.\n\nThe adjusted method must perform an element-wise comparison of VLAs, ensuring that both the content and structure (array length of each element within the VLA) are identical. This approach should eliminate false positives in the comparison report, where VLAs currently trigger a difference notice even when identical by structure and content."
