Based on the description, it seems related to a fractional field operation within a certain class, likely dealing with rational numbers or algebraic structures.\n\nWe'll start by trying to find which class `QQ` belongs to and then attempt to locate the `frac_field` method or functionality associated with it. This approach will help us understand how `1/x` is being handled and why `x` might not be included in the result.\n\n1. Since `QQ` seems to be a class or a part of a larger class dealing with fractions or rational numbers, we'll first search for the class `QQ`.\n2. Then, given that `frac_field` is mentioned as a method or a feature, we'll look for this method within the `QQ` class or across the project if the class context is not sufficient.\n3. We might also need to search for any code snippet using `frac_field` to see how it's typically invoked and if there are any conditions or edge cases already being handled that relate to the issue.\n\nHere are the API calls to start with:\n- `search_class(\"QQ\")`\n- `search_method(\"frac_field\")`\n- `search_code(\"QQ.frac_field\")`"
