        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior involves ensuring that when generating a fraction field, particularly when involving elements and their inverses (like 1/x), the field construction logic should account for both the element and its inverse. This means if a fraction field is created with 1/x, the method should inherently consider x as part of this field. To resolve the issue, the method might need to be adjusted to automatically include elements and their inverses during the field's definition or initialization process."

This might involve enhancing the logic that interprets the generators provided to the method, ensuring that the field recognizes both an element and its inverse as belonging to it."
