Therefore, we should adjust our strategy to explore the logging functionalities within pytest, especially around the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file since that's where references to `_initial_handler_level` were found.\n\nThe findings around `_initial_handler_level` hint at its involvement in the logging configuration or state management within pytest's logging system. Since the issue mentions that `_initial_handler_level` is incorrectly managed across multiple `set_level` calls for a logger, leading it to restore a logger's level incorrectly after a test, it's crucial to understand how this variable is being manipulated.\n\nThe intended behavior, as per the issue description, should ensure that after multiple invocations of `caplog.set_level`, the logging level of a handler is correctly restored to its original state before any `set_level` call was made within the test. This implies that `_initial_handler_level` should remember the first set level before any test manipulation, not the last or one before the last.\n\nTo further analyze the context and understand how `_initial_handler_level` is used or possibly misused across the codebase, it would be beneficial to:\n\n1. Look at the actual definitions and usages of `_initial_handler_level` within `src/_pytest/logging.py`. This can give insight into its manipulation logic.\n2. Because `caplog.set_level` could not be directly found, investigate the relevant logging setup and configuration code within `src/_pytest/logging.py` to see how level settings and restorations are handled.\n   \nHence, the next steps should involve:\n\n- Looking into the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file for mentions of `_initial_handler_level` and any related logging setup or teardown logic: `search_code_in_file(\"_initial_handler_level\", \"src/_pytest/logging.py\")`.\n- Also, to ensure we cover all bases regarding the `caplog.set_level` functionality, it would be useful to look into how `set_level` is implemented in this logging system: `search_method_in_file(\"set_level\", \"src/_pytest/logging.py\")`.\n\nThese steps will provide a deeper understanding of how logging levels are managed and how `_initial_handler_level` plays a role in this process, directly addressing the issue at hand."

Bug location: \n   - File: `src/_pytest/logging.py`\n   - The specific method where the bug resides wasn't directly identified due to the lack of direct search results for `caplog.set_level` within the file. However, the issue revolves around the manipulation of `_initial_handler_level` within handlers when `set_level` is called. Given the issue description and the known inclusion of `_initial_handler_level` in this file, the intended behavior should be observed within the mechanism that handles logging levels\u2014specifically when setting a new level and restoring the old one after a test is completed.\n\nIntended Behavior:\n- Within the involved method(s) in `src/_pytest/logging.py` that manage logging levels via `caplog.set_level`, ensure that `_initial_handler_level` dictionary uses `setdefault` rather than `set` when updating handler levels for the first time. This change is crucial to ensure that the initial logging level of each handler is captured and preserved correctly before any test manipulates it.\n- When restoring handler levels after a test, the restoration process should reference `_initial_handler_level` to set each handler's level back to its original state before the first `set_level` call in the test scope, ensuring true restoration to pre-test conditions.\n- Ensure that if `set_level` is called multiple times within the same test, `_initial_handler_level` does not overwrite the initially stored level with subsequent calls. Only the first call's level should be stored as the initial state to be restored post-test.\n- This restoration mechanism ensures that tests which modify logging levels do not interfere with each other by incorrectly setting up logging states based on the modifications made by previous tests within the same session.\n\nGiven the information from the initial API calls, this description outlines the necessary fix without pinpointing a specific method due to the lack of direct access to `caplog.set_level` implementation specifics."
