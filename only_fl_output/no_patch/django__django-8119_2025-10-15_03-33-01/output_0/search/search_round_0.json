        "content": "To tackle the issue at hand, we need to understand how the `.filter()` method is implemented within the project's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. This involves looking into the classes that define or manipulate querysets or filters, as these would likely contain the implementation of the `.filter()` method. Furthermore, the issue mentions the desire to allow expressions in filter calls, specifically mentioning an example that appears to utilize a function or method `F()` producing an expression that is compared using `==`. We need to gather context on how expressions are currently handled and how they might be integrated or parsed within the `.filter()` calls.\n\nTo achieve this, I will make the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"filter\")`: To find the implementation or declarations of the `.filter()` method across the entire codebase. This will help in understanding where and how filter methods are defined, which is critical for allowing expressions within them.\n\n2. `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`: The `.filter()` method is typically a part of a QuerySet in ORMs. By finding the `QuerySet` class, we can understand how filtering is currently implemented and where to best implement the functionality for supporting expressions.\n\n3. `search_code(\"F()\")`: To understand how the `F()` function or similar expressions are currently implemented or used within the codebase, providing insight into how these could be integrated into filter calls.\n\nThese selected API calls should give us sufficient code context to approach resolving the issue, focusing on extending the `.filter()` method to support expressions and thereby enhancing the flexibility of the ORM."
