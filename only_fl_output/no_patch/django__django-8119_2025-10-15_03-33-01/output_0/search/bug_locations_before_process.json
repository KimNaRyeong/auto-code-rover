        "intended_behavior": "The `filter` method should be enhanced to parse and interpret expressions such as those returned by `F()` function calls, alongside the current ability to filter using keyword arguments. This functionality will involve dynamically parsing these expressions to generate the appropriate SQL query part that reflects the condition expressed by the `F()` expression (e.g., lowercasing a field before comparison). The enhancement should be done in such a way that it maintains backward compatibility with existing `filter` functionality, allowing both traditional keyword arguments and the new expression-based syntax to be used. This could involve introducing a mechanism to detect and handle expression objects differently from how simple key-value pairs are currently treated."
