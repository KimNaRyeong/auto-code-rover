They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather context on how `requests` handles exceptions from `urllib3`, focusing particularly on how `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` are managed. We'll target the wrapping or re-raising of these exceptions within the `requests` package. My plan is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Exception Handling in Requests**:\n    - Since exceptions are typically either raised or caught in methods, we'll start by looking for how `requests` handles or re-raises exceptions originating from `urllib3`.\n\n2. **Search for References to the Specific Urllib3 Exceptions**:\n    - Directly search for references to `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` within the `requests` codebase to see how they're being handled or if they're being passed through without wrapping.\n\n3. **Find Exception Wrapping Mechanism**:\n    - It's also valuable to understand if `requests` has a general mechanism for wrapping exceptions from `urllib3`, which can be identified by searching for any code that catches `urllib3` exceptions to wrap them into `requests` exception types.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we'll start with:\n\n- `search_code(\"requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError\")`: This will help us locate where in `requests` the `DecodeError` from `urllib3` is referenced.\n- `search_code(\"requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError\")`: Similar to the above, but focusing on `TimeoutError`.\n- `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions\")`: This broader search can reveal places where `requests` might be handling other `urllib3.exceptions` in a general way, which could include wrapping or re-raising them into `requests`-specific exceptions.\n\nLet's execute these searches to form our understanding."
