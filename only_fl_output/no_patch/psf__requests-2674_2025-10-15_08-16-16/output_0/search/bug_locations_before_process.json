These exceptions need to be caught in the areas where requests are processed and responses are handled or during any interaction with `urllib3` that might raise these exceptions. Adapt methods for sending requests and handling responses to include specific try-except blocks for `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`, wrapping them in a corresponding `requests.exceptions` class to maintain a consistent interface for `requests` users."
