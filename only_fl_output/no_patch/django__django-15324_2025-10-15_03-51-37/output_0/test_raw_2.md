Let's create an updated `reproducer.py` script that aims to reproduce the described issue without relying on external libraries such as `requests_toolbelt`, ensuring it can run with only the standard library and `requests` installed. This script will manually modify the HTTP request to include a null byte in the filename extension, as described in your scenario:

```python
# reproducerer.py
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    contents = "." * (1024 * 1024 * 3)  # 3 MB of dots
    # Using a StringIO or BytesIO object would be preferential for real file handling
    # but here we're directly crafting the body for simplicity and control.
    
    # Preparing the multipart/form-data body manually
    boundary = '----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW'
    body = (
        f"--{boundary}\r\n"
        f"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"docfile\"; filename=\"bogus.txt\\x00\"\r\n"
        f"Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n"
        f"{contents}\r\n"
        f"--{boundary}--"
    )
    body = body.replace("\\x00", "\x00")  # Insert actual null byte into the content
    
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': f'multipart/form-data; boundary={boundary}',
        'Content-Length': str(len(body)),
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", headers=headers, data=body)
        # Success criteria could vary; you might check for a specific response or lack of server error
        assert response.status_code != 500, "Server encountered an internal error."
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while sending the request:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue was reproduced.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        print("Script completed successfully. The issue might be resolved if no errors shown.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        exit(1)

```

This script manually assembles the multipart/form-data body including a filename with a null byte (translated from the escaped representation to an actual null byte within the request body). The request is sent to the Django server which should, according to your description, attempt to handle this file upload and potentially trigger the error.

If the Django application returns a 500 status code in response to this crafted request, the `AssertionError` is raised indicating the issue is present. Adjustments to the success criteria (i.e., what constitutes the issue being present or resolved) may be necessary based on the specific implementation details and expected behavior of your Django application.
