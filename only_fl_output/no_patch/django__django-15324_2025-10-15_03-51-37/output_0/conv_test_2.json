The assertions and error handling mechanisms should be adjusted based on the responses observed from your Django application running locally, specifically looking for unexpected behavior or errors resulting from the crafted request. \n\nThe usage of `requests_toolbelt.multipart.encoder.MultipartEncoder` allows for more control over the multipart form-data request being sent, particularly useful in edge cases like this. Ensure the `requests_toolbelt` package is installed in your environment (`pip install requests_toolbelt`) to use this feature."
