Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\nif not has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nI don't know if it could be done in a nicer way. I was able to reproduce this in 1.8.18 and 1.11.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue reported, we need to look into the Django ORM's implementation regarding queryset annotations, specifically how querysets handle raw SQL annotations and the aggregation (count) method. The issue highlights a problematic interaction in handling annotated fields inherited from a base model. The information needed involves understanding the underlying Django ORM code that deals with annotated querysets and the aggregation process, especially how it handles joins and group_by clauses.\n\nConsidering the detailed description of the issue, we should focus on the following aspects:\n\n1. The classes `BaseItem` and `Item` to understand the inheritance and how Django ORM might treat fields from a base class in derived models.\n2. The implementation of `RawSQL` annotation to see how custom SQL expressions are handled within Django querysets.\n3. The implementation of the `count` method on a queryset, particularly looking into the `Query.get_aggregation` method mentioned in the issue, as this seems to be where the problem originates.\n4. The handling of `default_cols`, `group_by`, and the decision-making process that leads to dropping the `INNER JOIN`, resulting in the error described.\n\nBased on the above points, here are the search API calls that I would perform to gather the necessary context to address the issue:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseItem\")`: To get context about the base model.\n- `search_class(\"Item\")`: To get context about the model inheriting from `BaseItem`.\n- `search_class(\"RawSQL\")`: To understand how raw SQL annotations are implemented.\n- `search_method(\"get_aggregation\")`: To find out how aggregation queries are constructed and how they handle joins and grouping.\n\nThese searches should provide a broad understanding of how these components interact within Django's ORM and shed light on where the issue's fix needs to be applied."
