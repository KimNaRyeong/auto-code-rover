        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of footnotes being incorrectly rendered as `?` in the PDF output of a Sphinx document, we need to assess how Sphinx handles footnotes in the document-to-latex conversion process. Given the information about the bug and the Sphinx version specified, it would be sensible to explore how footnotes are processed within the Sphinx codebase, especially how explicit footnote references are parsed and converted into LaTeX. We should focus on classes or methods related to the LaTeX builder, or those handling reStructuredText parsing, especially as it pertains to footnotes.\n\nTherefore, our first steps will involve searching for the relevant classes and methods involved in this process. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LaTeXBuilder\")`: Since the issue occurs during the `make latexpdf` process, it's likely that the `LaTeXBuilder` class or its equivalents handle the conversion of footnotes for LaTeX output.\n\n2. `search_method(\"write_footnotes\")`: This method name is speculative but represents what we would expect to be involved in processing footnotes for any output, including LaTeX.\n\n3. `search_code(\"footnote\")`: Since we're not entirely sure how footnotes are specifically handled, searching the codebase for instances of \"footnote\" might reveal functions, method calls, or other relevant snippets that are involved in the process.\n\nThese API calls are aimed to provide a broad overview of the mechanisms Sphinx employs to handle footnotes and their references, especially focusing on the generation of LaTeX documents. With the insights gained from these calls, we should be able to identify relevant code paths and further investigate the cause of the bug."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have several leads to follow:\n\n### LaTeXBuilder Class\nThe `LaTeXBuilder` class within `sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py` is central to the process of converting documents into LaTeX format. This class orchestrates the overall process of generating LaTeX files from the source documents. Its methods involve initializing the document, managing the document context, handling files (including copying support and additional files), and finalizing the document output. The specific handling of footnotes within the LaTeX conversion process is not directly evident within the listed methods of this class. However, the presence of a `default_translator_class` which is the `LaTeXTranslator`, suggests that the translation of specific document elements to LaTeX (potentially including footnotes) is handled by a translator class, which merits further investigation.\n\n### Search for \"write_footnotes\"\nThe method `write_footnotes` was not found, which indicates either that the processing of footnotes does not rely on a method with this exact name or that footnote handling is abstracted differently within the codebase. Given Sphinx's extensible architecture, it's possible that footnotes are managed through a series of transformations or via the translator class mentioned in the `LaTeXBuilder`.\n\n### Sphinx Codebase Results for \"footnote\"\nThe search for \"footnote\" yielded 311 snippets within various files, among which `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py` stand out as particularly relevant. The `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file is likely where the actual conversion of reStructuredText elements to LaTeX commands occurs, including how footnotes are formatted. Meanwhile, `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py` suggests the presence of transformations specific to LaTeX output, which could include the handling or restructuring of footnote references to fit LaTeX's requirements.\n\n#### 1. Analysis of Potential Involvement with Footnotes\n- The writers and transforms specifically targeting LaTeX output are crucial in understanding how Sphinx deals with footnotes in the conversion process. Given the error involves footnotes being incorrectly rendered in the final PDF, the implementation within these files is directly related to the bug.\n- The intended behavior for this part of the code would be to correctly process and reference footnotes within LaTeX documents, ensuring that each footnote is correctly hyperlinked and displayed, instead of showing a '?' symbol.\n\n#### 2. Relationship and Further Actions\nThe issue points towards a potential bug in the handling or referencing of footnotes during the LaTeX conversion process. Based on this, our focus should shift towards examining how `LaTeXTranslator` and the various transformations applied within `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py` handle footnotes. Specifically, we need to look into how footnotes are defined and how references to them are managed throughout the transformation process to identifying any discrepancies or potential failures in reference resolution.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, the next steps should include:\n- **Exploring the `LaTeXTranslator` Class**: Specifically, how this class handles footnotes and their references. This may require looking into its methods or any superclass methods that it overrides which are relevant to footnote processing.\n- **Reviewing the `transforms.py` and `latex.py` Files**: Inspecting the implementations within these files could reveal how footnotes are handled during the LaTeX conversion process. Understanding the logic and transformations applied may point to where the process breaks down for repeated footnote references.\n\n### Proposed API Calls\nTo proceed, we should focus on:\n- `search_class_in_file(\"LaTeXTranslator\", \"sphinx/writers/latex.py\")`: To understand how `LaTeXTranslator` contributes to footnote handling.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"footnote\", \"sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py\")`: Since this file has a significant number of matches for \"footnote,\" examining how footnotes are transformed could be key."

This may involve ensuring that footnote references are correctly recognized and linked to their definitions within the LaTeX output. The class might require modifications or additional handling logic to specifically cater to the scenario where multiple references to a single footnote are made, ensuring consistency in rendering and hyperlink functionality.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This file likely contains transformations applied to documents during the LaTeX building process, including those related to footnotes. The intended behavior here would be to adjust or refine these transformations to ensure that explicitly numbered footnotes and their subsequent references are correctly transformed into LaTeX syntax that preserves hyperlinks and display properties. This could involve fixing or improving the logic that translates Sphinx footnote syntax into LaTeX commands that are recognized and correctly processed by LaTeX compilers.\n\nGiven the complex nature of translating reStructuredText to LaTeX, especially with features like footnotes that inherently involve references within the document, ensuring that these references are accurately maintained in the LaTeX output is crucial. The changes should not disrupt existing functionality, particularly with respect to other footnote types or referencing systems within Sphinx documents."
