We should also check how `dtype` is being handled within these methods or any related procedures.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"TfidfVectorizer\")`: To get the file where `TfidfVectorizer` is implemented, which will help us navigate to the relevant code.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: To understand how the `fit` method is implemented within `TfidfVectorizer`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: Since the issue describes a problem with the output of `fit/fit_transform`, we need to inspect this method too.\n- `search_code(\"dtype=np.float64\")`: To find where exactly the `dtype` is being set or defaulted to `np.float64`, as this might be the crucial spot where`dtype` is not behaving as expected according to the user-specified argument."
