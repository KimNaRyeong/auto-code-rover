        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to return `NotImplemented` instead of `False` when the comparison cannot be determined due to the `other` object not being an instance of a Django `Model`. This change is intended to follow the Python data model guidelines more closely, allowing Python to attempt the reversed comparison (`other.__eq__(self)`) or default to identity comparison. The modification should preserve the existing functionality of comparing the primary keys for model instances. The condition checking whether `other` is an instance of `Model` would be the primary place for this change. After this adjustment, the method's structure would initially check if `other` is not an instance of `Model`, and if so, return `NotImplemented`. Other conditions and comparisons within the method would remain as they are, to ensure that the equality check behaves correctly when `other` is a model instance."
