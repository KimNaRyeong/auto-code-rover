Given these parameters, I will adjust the script to directly target the specified issue. The revised `reproducer.py` below aims to confirm if an `AssertionError` is raised when the issue is present, specifically focusing on whether a weighted operation in xarray with a non-existent dimension raises an error as expected. The script will utilize the defined function to print a stack trace clearly if any unexpected exception occurs, ensuring clarity in error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_weighted_operation():
    import xarray as xr

    ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")
    try:
        # Perform a weighted operation with a non-existing dimension
        ds.weighted(xr.ones_like(ds["air"])).mean("nonexistent_dimension")
    except KeyError:
        # If a KeyError is raised, this means the dimensions check is working as expected
        print("Correctly raised a KeyError for non-existent dimension.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    # If no exception is raised, this might indicate that the behavior is not as expected
    return False

def main():
    assert test_weighted_operation(), "Weighted operation did not raise an error for non-existing dimension!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
```

This script, when executed in the project's root directory via `python3 reproducerer.py`, will validate whether the intended error-checking behavior related to dimension existence within weighted operations is properly implemented in xarray. 

- If the `AssertionError` is raised, suggesting a problematic behavior (non-raising of errors by weighted operations when dimensions do not exist), the script will print a relevant stack trace and exit with code 1.
- If the test passes without exceptions, indicating the issue has been addressed and the behavior is as expected (i.e., errors are properly raised for non-existent dimensions in weighted operations), the script will print a confirmation message and exit with code 0.
