Moreover we added a cache backend for pymemcache (#29887) so we have a good builtin alternative.\nI think it's time to deprecate the django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache backend in Django 3.2 and remove it in Django 4.1.\n</issue>"

This will help in identifying where to add deprecation notices or possibly guide users towards the new `pymemcache` backend.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"MemcachedCache\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for documentation or comments regarding `MemcachedCache`:** This can help in modifying the documentation to mark `MemcachedCache` as deprecated and to suggest `pymemcache` as an alternative.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"memcached.MemcachedCache\")\n   ```   \n\nThese calls aim at getting an overview of where changes are required, including updating the documentation, adding deprecation warnings, and guidance for migration to the new caching backend."
