The main components mentioned in the issue are related to classes and methods that manage color normalization and callback mechanisms. Here are my selections for API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `Normalize` objects are structured and potentially updated:\n   - `search_class(\"Normalize\")`\n\n2. Given that `AxesImage` is directly affected by changes in `Normalize` instances:\n   - `search_class(\"AxesImage\")`\n\n3. To comprehend how color scales are applied and updated across multiple images, it's crucial to see how the `set_norm` method is utilized within context:\n   - `search_method(\"set_norm\")`\n\n4. Since the issue description mentions the use of a callback function `update` for syncing changes across images, investigating how callbacks are registered and invoked can provide insights:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"connect\", \"CallbackRegistry\")`\n\n5. Finally, to understand how `set_clim` interacts with the normalization and potentially triggers updates (or fails to):\n   - `search_method(\"set_clim\")`\n\nThese API calls should give a comprehensive view of how `Normalize` objects interact with scalar-mappables and what might be missing in the current event notification chain that prevents updates from propagating as expected."
