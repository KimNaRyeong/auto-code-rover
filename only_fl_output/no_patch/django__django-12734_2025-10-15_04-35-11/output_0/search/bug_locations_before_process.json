        "intended_behavior": "This method should include additional logic to check for changes to fields that are part of a 'ManyToManyField' relationship, particularly the precision changes in fields. When a primary field's properties like 'max_length' are altered (which is used in a 'ManyToManyField' intermediary table), the migration logic should similarly update the corresponding field in the intermediary table. This ensures consistency across all database tables and preserves data integrity. The existing functionality of applying migrations in a forward order, handling operations transactionally, and managing non-SQL operations must be preserved while introducing checks and corresponding updates for 'ManyToManyField' intermediary tables during precision changes."
