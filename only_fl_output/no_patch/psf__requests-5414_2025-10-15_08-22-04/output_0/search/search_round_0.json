It seems like the intention so far has been to raise `InvalidUrl` instead (see e.g. [this line](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/ca6f9af5dba09591007b15a7368bc0f006b7cc50/requests/models.py#L401)).\nI see there was some hesitation in fixing a similar issue (#4168) and would like to add that even catching the error just to rethrow as a requests exception would be beneficial.\n## Expected Result\nBased on PR #774: `InvalidUrl: URL has an invalid label.`\n## Actual Result\n`UnicodeError: encoding with 'idna' codec failed (UnicodeError: label empty or too long)`\n## Reproduction Steps\n```python3\nimport requests\nrequests.get(\"http://.example.com\")\n```\n## System Information\n$ python -m requests.help\n```\n{\n\"chardet\": {\n\"version\": \"3.0.4\"\n},\n\"cryptography\": {\n\"version\": \"2.8\"\n},\n\"idna\": {\n\"version\": \"2.8\"\n},\n\"implementation\": {\n\"name\": \"CPython\",\n\"version\": \"3.8.0\"\n},\n\"platform\": {\n\"release\": \"5.3.0-40-generic\",\n\"system\": \"Linux\"\n},\n\"pyOpenSSL\": {\n\"openssl_version\": \"1010104f\",\n\"version\": \"19.1.0\"\n},\n\"requests\": {\n\"version\": \"2.23.0\"\n},\n\"system_ssl\": {\n\"version\": \"1010103f\"\n},\n\"urllib3\": {\n\"version\": \"1.25.8\"\n},\n\"using_pyopenssl\": true\n}\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more information about how URLs are processed and where the `UnicodeError` could be intercepted and replaced with an `InvalidUrl` exception. The issue mentions encountering a `UnicodeError` when attempting to retrieve a URL with an invalid label, which should instead result in an `InvalidUrl` exception according to the user's expectation, referencing a specific line in the `requests` library.\n\nFirst, let's get more context about the handling of URLs in the relevant parts of the Requests library. Considering the issue mentions a specific line in a file (models.py) related to raising `InvalidUrl`, and discusses catching a `UnicodeError` to rethrow it as a requests exception, we should examine the surrounding code to understand the current handling mechanism.\n\n1. Locate where `InvalidUrl` is defined to understand its context and usage:\n   - `search_class(\"InvalidUrl\")`\n\n2. Examine the code around the referenced line where `InvalidUrl` is expected to be raised to see how URL validation is currently implemented:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"requests/models.py\", 401, 10)`\n\n3. Gather context on how `UnicodeError` might be raised during URL processing. Since the issue mentions the use of the `idna` codec, understanding where this codec is applied to URLs could be key:\n   - `search_code(\"idna codec\")`\n\nThese API calls should help gain a clearer understanding of where and how the error handling for invalid URLs could be improved in the Requests library."
