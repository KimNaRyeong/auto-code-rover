        "intended_behavior": "In the `prepare_url` method, the intention is to properly catch any `UnicodeError` that arises during IDNA encoding of the host part of a URL and raise an `InvalidURL` exception instead. The `UnicodeError` can occur when the IDNA encoding function encounters an invalid label, such as an empty label (`http://.example.com`) which is not compliant with IDNA standards. The existing code attempts to handle this scenario, but based on the issue report, it may not catch all instances of `UnicodeError`. Therefore, the explicit catching of `UnicodeError` during the encoding process to throw an `InvalidURL` exception should be ensured. This behavior should preserve the method's purpose of validating and preparing a URL for a request by applying the correct exception handling for all types of URL parsing issues."
