The issue mentions encountering a `UnicodeError` when attempting to retrieve a URL with an invalid label, which should instead result in an `InvalidUrl` exception according to the user's expectation, referencing a specific line in the `requests` library.\n\nFirst, let's get more context about the handling of URLs in the relevant parts of the Requests library. Considering the issue mentions a specific line in a file (models.py) related to raising `InvalidUrl`, and discusses catching a `UnicodeError` to rethrow it as a requests exception, we should examine the surrounding code to understand the current handling mechanism.\n\n1. Locate where `InvalidUrl` is defined to understand its context and usage:\n   - `search_class(\"InvalidUrl\")`\n\n2. Examine the code around the referenced line where `InvalidUrl` is expected to be raised to see how URL validation is currently implemented:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"requests/models.py\", 401, 10)`\n\n3.

It outlines several checks and transformations a URL undergoes before it is considered valid for making requests.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   - The code checks if the URL's scheme is missing and raises a `MissingSchema` error if it is.\n   - It checks if a host is present in the URL. If not, it raises an `InvalidURL` exception.\n   - It attempts to IDNA encode the hostname if it contains non-ASCII characters or starts with a wildcard (*), to ensure the hostname adheres to IDNA standards. If encoding fails or if the host starts with a wildcard, it raises an `InvalidURL` exception with a message indicating \"URL has an invalid label.\"\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   - The bug report pertains directly to this portion of the code. A `UnicodeError` occurs when an attempt is made to IDNA encode an invalid hostname, specifically in cases where the label is empty or does not meet IDNA standards. According to the bug description, rather than this specific `UnicodeError`, an `InvalidURL` exception should be raised to maintain consistency and provide clearer error handling.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   - The intended behavior would be to catch the `UnicodeError` during the IDNA encoding attempt and re-throw it as an `InvalidURL` exception. This approach aligns with handling other invalid URL conditions (e.g., missing scheme, no host, or invalid label) and provides a uniform way to handle URL validation errors. Specifically, the error message \"URL has an invalid label\" seems designed for this purpose but the catchment of `UnicodeError` needs to be explicit to address the reported bug.\n\n### Next Steps for Code Context\n\nGiven that the class `InvalidUrl` could not be found, and the code snippet precisely around the handling of URLs and IDNA encoding has been identified, the next logical step is to confirm the behavior of the `_get_idna_encoded_host` method which is directly involved in the exception:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_get_idna_encoded_host\", \"PreparedRequest\")`\n\nAdditionally, since the initial search for the `idna codec` did not return relevant results within the provided snippets, refining the search to understand where and how the Requests library interfaces with the idna library might be necessary. However, given the direct reference to the `_get_idna_encoded_host` method in the existing code snippet, it's prudent to focus on this method first for modification according to the issue's feedback."

The `UnicodeError` can occur when the IDNA encoding function encounters an invalid label, such as an empty label (`http://.example.com`) which is not compliant with IDNA standards. The existing code attempts to handle this scenario, but based on the issue report, it may not catch all instances of `UnicodeError`. Therefore, the explicit catching of `UnicodeError` during the encoding process to throw an `InvalidURL` exception should be ensured. This behavior should preserve the method's purpose of validating and preparing a URL for a request by applying the correct exception handling for all types of URL parsing issues."
