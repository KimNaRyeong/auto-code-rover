Below is a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the reported issue. The script attempts to perform an HTTP GET request to a problematic URL (`http://.example.com`), which is expected to raise a `UnicodeError` under the conditions described. It uses an assertion to check if the correct exception (`InvalidUrl`) is raised instead of `UnicodeError`. The script uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed information about the stack trace when the issue is encountered, helping to pinpoint where the error originates in the code.

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import InvalidURL

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_invalid_url_exception():
    try:
        requests.get("http://.example.com")
        # If no exception is raised, we assert False to indicate failure.
        assert False, "Expected InvalidURL to be raised."
    except UnicodeError as e:
        # If UnicodeError is caught, print the stack trace and assert False.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "UnicodeError raised instead of InvalidURL."
    except InvalidURL:
        # If InvalidURL is caught, the expected behavior occurred.
        print("InvalidURL exception raised as expected.")
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other unexpected exceptions, print the stack trace,
        # and assert False to indicate failure.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, f"Unexpected exception raised: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_invalid_url_exception()
```

When the issue is present, this script will print a stack trace of the issue and raise an `AssertionError` indicating that the `UnicodeError` was raised instead of the expected `InvalidURL`. Conversely, if the issue is fixed, and the `InvalidURL` exception is correctly raised, the script will simply print "InvalidURL exception raised as expected." and exit with code 0, indicating success.
