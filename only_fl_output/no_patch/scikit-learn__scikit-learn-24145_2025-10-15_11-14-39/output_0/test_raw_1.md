Given the constraints and requirements detailed in your request, I'm providing you with an updated `reproducer.py` script designed to attempt instantiation and use of a `SplineTransformer` from `scikit-learn` with a non-existing `sparse` parameter, which will hopefully help in reproducing the issue as described. This script assumes that the `SplineTransformer` does not yet support the desired sparse output feature, thus attempting to use this feature should result in an `AssertionError` when the feature isn't implemented, and succeed otherwise.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Import necessary libraries
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer
    
    # Test data
    X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)
    
    # Attempt to use a feature that is expected to be missing
    # The 'sparse=True' parameter should cause an error if the issue is present
    spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)
    
    # If the above line does not raise an error, it implies the issue might have been fixed
    # However, we should still check the output type
    transformed = spline.fit_transform(X)
    
    # Verify that the output is indeed a sparse matrix
    # This is the ultimate confirmation that the issue has been addressed
    if not hasattr(transformed, "toarray"):
        # This error is expected if the output is not sparse as desired
        raise AssertionError("Output is not a sparse matrix.")
    
    # If no exceptions were raised, assume the feature has been correctly implemented
    print("Feature implemented correctly. Exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate a problem was encountered
```

This script checks directly for the implementation of the `sparse` parameter in `SplineTransformer` and attempts to verify the type of the output. Please remember, this script assumes that the `SplineTransformer` with the `sparse` parameter is not yet implemented in scikit-learn, and thus, if the script runs without error, it likely means that the feature has been implemented or that the `SplineTransformer` definition has changed since the time of writing.
