To create a standalone Python script that checks for the presence of a specific issue and adheres to your instructions, I'll provide a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding the execution environment and the error reported. It appears the reported error is related to a faulty scikit-learn installation rather than the specific `SplineTransformer` feature discussed. 

Nonetheless, I'll craft a script aimed at reproducing the issue as originally described: attempting to use a `SplineTransformer` with a `sparse` parameter, which, according to the issue description, is not currently supported but is being proposed for future inclusion.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer

    # Define input data
    X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)

    # Instantiate the SplineTransformer with the proposed 'sparse' parameter
    # This is expected to raise an exception because 'sparse' is not yet implemented
    spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)
    result = spline.fit_transform(X)

    # If we reach this point without an error, it means the issue has likely been fixed.
    # We can attempt to further assert the output's type for the sake of completeness
    assert result is not None, "Result should not be None"
    if hasattr(result, "toarray"):
        # If the result has 'toarray', it is likely a sparse matrix, which is expected
        print("Output appears to be a sparse matrix. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Output is not a sparse matrix.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # If any exception occurs, exit with code 1 indicating the issue is present or there's another problem.
```

This script is specifically designed to test the scenario described in your issue. If the script exits with code 0, it means the `SplineTransformer`'s `sparse` parameter is supported and operates as expected. If it exits with code 1, it's either because the issue is still present (i.e., the feature hasn't been implemented yet or there was an execution error such as the aforementioned faulty installation).
