        "intended_behavior": "This method should be adapted to respect `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings. If these settings are provided within the `_settings` dict of the `StrPrinter` class, they should be used to decide the format (fixed or scientific notation) of floating-point numbers based on their value. The method must preserve its functionality for handling `strip_zeros` and any original formatting logic. The modification should introduce a check to determine if the float's value falls within the range specified by `min_fixed` and `max_fixed`. If so, use fixed-point notation; otherwise, use scientific notation. This requires integration with the number formatting mechanisms already in place."

        "method": "_print_Float",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `StrPrinter`, this method in the `LatexPrinter` class needs to incorporate `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings into its logic for printing floats. The method must ensure that floating-point numbers are produced in LaTeX format adhering to these new settings while still accommodating the existing `strip_zeros` setting. This change involves adjusting the formatting decision process to use fixed or scientific notation based on the provided settings. As in `StrPrinter`, ensure the functionality does not disrupt existing behavior but extends it to consider these additional settings."
