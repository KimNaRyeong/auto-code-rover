        "intended_behavior": "The initialization of the `offsetText` for the XAxis object should conditionally set its color based on the `xtick.labelcolor` parameter. If `xtick.labelcolor` is set to anything other than `'inherit'`, the `offsetText` color should use this value. Otherwise, it should fall back to using `mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']`. This ensures the offset text (such as the exponent in scientific notation) follows the specified label color, allowing for consistent formatting according to user preferences."

        "method": "_init",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `XAxis`, the YAxis's `offsetText` initialization should follow a conditional color assignment based on the `ytick.labelcolor` setting. If `ytick.labelcolor` is specified and differs from `'inherit'`, this color should be applied to the `offsetText`. If `ytick.labelcolor` is `'inherit'` or not set, the code should default to `mpl.rcParams['ytick.color']`. This change is aimed at respecting the user's customization for the label color while ensuring the offset text aligns with the label's appearance for a coherent aesthetic."
