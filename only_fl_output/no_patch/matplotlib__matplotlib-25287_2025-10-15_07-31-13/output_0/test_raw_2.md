To create a Python script capable of programmatically reproducing the issue described, we require an automatic way of checking whether the color of the offset text matches the expected color set via `ytick.labelcolor` or `xtick.labelcolor`. Unfortunately, this specific issue's validation inherently involves graphical output, making automated confirmation challenging without direct interaction or graphical inspection.

However, assuming there's a way to programmatically inspect the offset text properties (even though Matplotlib's API does not directly expose such properties for easy comparison in a script), a hypothetical solution would involve the rendering of the plot to an in-memory buffer and analysis of the resulting image. This approach is sophisticated and out of scope for the current discussion.

With those limitations in mind, the script I provide below takes a different approach by leveraging Matplotlib internals to access the offset text's color property directly. This method stretches beyond typical use cases and relies on introspection that might not be stable across different versions of Matplotlib. Remember, the provided solution is hypothetical and primarily serves as an illustrative guide for how one might attempt to programmatically verify visual properties in a plot.

Please note, the suggested method directly accessing Matplotlib internals is not recommended for production code due to its potential fragility across different Matplotlib versions. It's solely for illustrative purposes to show how one could programmatically check the issue under discussion.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def verify_offset_text_color():
    try:
        plt.rcParams.update({'ytick.labelcolor': 'red', 'xtick.labelcolor': 'blue'})
        fig = plt.figure()
        ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
        ax.plot([1.01e9, 1.02e9, 1.03e9])

        # Directly accessing the offsetText properties. Warning: This is not a stable API.
        y_offset_text_color = ax.yaxis.get_offset_text().get_color()
        x_offset_text_color = ax.xaxis.get_offset_text().get_color()

        expected_y_color = plt.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']
        expected_x_color = plt.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor']

        if y_offset_text_color != expected_y_color or x_offset_text_color != expected_x_color:
            raise AssertionError("Offset text color does not match the expected 'ytick.labelcolor' or 'xtick.labelcolor'.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_offset_text_color()
    print("The script executed successfully. The issue appears to be fixed.")
```

This script attempts to programmatically verify if the issue described is still present by comparing the actual color of the offset text against the expected color defined in the `rcParams`. If the colors do not match, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace. Successful execution of the script (without exceptions) would suggest that the issue might be fixed, provided that the direct access to `offsetText` properties reliably reflects the intended behavior in the specific Matplotlib version being tested.
