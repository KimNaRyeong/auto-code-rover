        "content": "Based on the output provided, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the test's intent and outcome. The script aimed to trigger an `AssertionError` if the `floatformat()` function raises a `ValueError` with the described conditions, which it successfully did. However, the description implied a different expectation for the test's outcome.\n\nThe output you've shared indicates that the script correctly reproduced the issue, as it was designed to do. When it says \"Issue detected: floatformat() raised ValueError on input '0.00' or Decimal('0.00') with 'prec' 0\", it means the script functioned correctly by detecting the problem.\n\nGiven the clarification, here is an adjusted version of `reproducer.py` that adheres closely to the original instructions. Please note, since the script behaved as expected by detecting the issue, significant changes are not necessary. However, I will ensure the intent and execution flow are clearer:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nfrom decimal import Decimal\nfrom django.template.defaultfilters import floatformat\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_floatformat():\n    try:\n        floatformat('0.00', 0)  # This should not raise an exception ideally\n        floatformat(Decimal('0.00'), 0)  # This should also not raise an exception ideally\n        # If no exception is raised, assume issue is fixed and exit with code 0.\n        print(\"The issue with floatformat() appears to be fixed.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # If a ValueError is caught, it means the issue is still present.\n        # Raising AssertionError here to explicitly mark the test as failed.\n        raise AssertionError(\"floatformat() raised ValueError on input '0.00' or Decimal('0.00') with 'prec' 0\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        test_floatformat()\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print(f\"Issue detected: {e}\")\n        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero status to indicate failure/error condition due to the issue still being present.\n```\n\nThis script's comments and logical flow have been clarified to better reflect the goal of reproducing the issue and the expectation for how it handles the detection of the problem."
