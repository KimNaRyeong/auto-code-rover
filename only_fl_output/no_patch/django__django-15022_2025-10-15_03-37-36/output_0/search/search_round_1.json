Thus, I will outline the necessary search API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Client` model** to understand its structure and relationships, especially how it relates to `ClientOffice`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Client\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `ClientOffice` model** for details on its fields and its foreign key relationship with `Client`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ClientOffice\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the `ClientAdmin` class** to review the admin options, particularly `search_fields`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ClientAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n4.

These snippets are used to filter querysets based on conditions, which in the case of the admin changelist, can involve complex queries that span multiple related objects.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: The bug involves excessive JOINs in admin changelist queries, presumably caused by the way search queries are handled. Since `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` is part of the Django admin, the snippets found within this file are highly relevant. They may reveal how the admin constructs queries based on `search_fields`, which could be the root cause of our performance issue.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, querying based on `search_fields` should be efficient, even with several search terms. The intended behavior would likely involve optimizing how JOINs are constructed or limiting them, especially when searching across related models. We need to understand how the current logic builds these queries and identify ways to optimize it without breaking the intended functionality.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the initial search didn't locate the specific models and admin class we're interested in, we should consider alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Search within a specific context**: Since the issue is likely related to Django's admin and how it handles queryset filtering for search terms, examining the direct context in `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` will be crucial. This involves looking at the code surrounding the `qs = qs.filter` snippets within this file:\n   ```\n   search_code_in_file(\"qs = qs.filter\", \"django/contrib/admin/views/main.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Broader search for admin configurations**: Since direct class names didn't yield results, searching for configuration patterns typical in Django admin classes like `search_fields` might provide indirect context. This can lead us to where `ClientAdmin` might be defined or how it's configured:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"search_fields\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps aim to dive deeper into how search queries are processed in the Django admin and to unearth more direct references to our models and their administration logic. By analyzing this context, we can move closer to addressing the performance issue at hand."

Since the exact method names were not provided, we focus on the logic processing `qs = qs.filter` as related to handling search queries.\n\n   **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The code at this location should efficiently handle search queries without generating an unnecessary number of JOINs for each word in the search query. One possible approach is to optimize queryset filtering logic by:\n     - Aggregating search terms to minimize the number of queries.\n     - Using more efficient database operations that can handle multiple search terms without resorting to additional JOINs for each term. This might involve conditional expressions or a more sophisticated query construction strategy that leverages Django's ORM capabilities.\n     - Implementing a pre-filter step to narrow down the result set before applying more complex filters that might include JOINs, potentially through the use of `Q` objects for complex lookups.\n     - Considering the use of database-specific full-text search capabilities, which might be more efficient for this use case.\n     \n     The overall goal is to preserve the existing functionality that allows admin users to search across multiple fields and related models but do so in a way that does not degrade performance as the number of terms in the search query increases. This requires a careful balance between flexibility and efficiency in the query construction process."
