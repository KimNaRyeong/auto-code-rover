        "content": "To resolve the issue properly, we need to gather context around several key areas mentioned in the issue description: the `Client` and `ClientOffice` models, the `ClientAdmin` class, and potentially the filter or search methods that might be causing unnecessary joins in the admin changelist query when using `search_fields`. Thus, I will outline the necessary search API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Client` model** to understand its structure and relationships, especially how it relates to `ClientOffice`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Client\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `ClientOffice` model** for details on its fields and its foreign key relationship with `Client`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ClientOffice\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the `ClientAdmin` class** to review the admin options, particularly `search_fields`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ClientAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n4. Since the issue mentions the pattern `qs = qs.filter(...)` as a potential cause for the performance problem when the search query contains several words, it's necessary to look into how the filtering is implemented, especially in relation to `search_fields`.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"qs = qs.filter\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering sufficient context regarding the models, the admin class, and the filtering logic that could be contributing to the performance issue by causing unnecessary joins in the admin list view's query."
