        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how Sphinx handles paths for resources like downloads and figures, and how it decides to name and store these files upon building the project. Since the issue suggests a lack of path normalization might be causing the problem, we should first look at the directives or methods that handle file paths for resources such as `downloads` and `figures`. Given that directives are a core part of Sphinx's functionality, they might be defined or used in specific classes or files within the Sphinx project.\n\nLet's start by searching for:\n\n1. The directives or methods that handle the `:download:` role to understand how Sphinx processes and stores resource files.\n2. Any code that might be involved in generating the filenames for stored resources, as the reported issue involves files being saved with incrementing numerical suffixes.\n3. Classes or methods that deal with path processing or normalization, which could be missing or improperly implemented based on the issue description.\n\nHere's a structured plan for our API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\":download:`\")`: To find snippets where the `:download:` role is handled or mentioned.\n- `search_method(\"normpath\")`: To see if and where the `os.path.normpath` method is used within the Sphinx codebase, which could be relevant for path normalization."

Given that we're dealing with resource handling and path normalization issues within Sphinx, a broader approach might be necessary. Here are some adjusted strategies:\n\n1. **Investigate How Sphinx Handles Files and Directives**: Since the specific `:download:` directive search returned no results, we should look into how Sphinx processes directives in general, and how it handles file paths for these directives. We could search for classes or methods related to file handling, directives processing, or the Sphinx builder process that generates the output files.\n\n2. **Search for General File Handling**: Since the `normpath` method wasn't found directly, it\u2019s possible that Sphinx uses a custom method or has a utility class for handling file paths. We should look for file path manipulation or normalization routines within Sphinx's codebase.\n\n3. **Explore Resource Copying or Managing Mechanisms**: Given that the issue describes files being copied with incremental suffixes, understanding how Sphinx manages resource copying to the build directory could also provide insights. We might find clues in classes or methods related to the build process, resource management, or file copying.\n\nConsidering these strategies, we can make the following revised API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Directive\")`: This could help us find where directives are defined or processed.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"copy\", \"builder.py\")`: Assuming Sphinx uses a builder pattern for generating output, this could help identify how files are copied during the build process.\n- `search_method(\"handle_path\")`: This is a more general search for methods that might handle path processing, based on a guess that a method with such a name could exist.\n\nThese calls are designed to cast a wider net based on the structure and functionality common to documentation generation tools like Sphinx."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
