        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how Sphinx handles paths for resources like downloads and figures, and how it decides to name and store these files upon building the project. Since the issue suggests a lack of path normalization might be causing the problem, we should first look at the directives or methods that handle file paths for resources such as `downloads` and `figures`. Given that directives are a core part of Sphinx's functionality, they might be defined or used in specific classes or files within the Sphinx project.\n\nLet's start by searching for:\n\n1. The directives or methods that handle the `:download:` role to understand how Sphinx processes and stores resource files.\n2. Any code that might be involved in generating the filenames for stored resources, as the reported issue involves files being saved with incrementing numerical suffixes.\n3. Classes or methods that deal with path processing or normalization, which could be missing or improperly implemented based on the issue description.\n\nHere's a structured plan for our API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\":download:`\")`: To find snippets where the `:download:` role is handled or mentioned.\n- `search_method(\"normpath\")`: To see if and where the `os.path.normpath` method is used within the Sphinx codebase, which could be relevant for path normalization."
