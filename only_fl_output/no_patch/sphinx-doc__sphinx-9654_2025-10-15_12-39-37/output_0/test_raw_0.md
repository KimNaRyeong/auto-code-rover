Here is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue of incorrect base class detection as described. It mimics the situation where a class hierarchy is created, similar to the inheritance chain described in the issue (A -> B -> C -> D), and then uses Sphinx (with autodoc) programmatically to generate documentation for the last class in the chain. The script then checks the generated documentation for the correct base class.

Please note, for this script to run, the environment must have Sphinx and any other dependencies installed. Also, adjust paths and class names as needed to fit the actual project structure or test requirements.

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_documentation(base_class_name):
    # Assuming Sphinx generated HTML files are in _build/html
    html_path = os.path.join('_build', 'html', 'api', 'datasets.html')
    if not os.path.exists(html_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Documentation HTML file not found: {html_path}")

    with open(html_path, 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()

    # Check if the base class in the documentation is correct
    if base_class_name not in contents:
        raise AssertionError(f"Base class {base_class_name} not found in documentation")

try:
    # Generate sphinx documentation
    subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', '.', '_build/html'])

    # After generating the documentation, check if the base class is correctly documented
    # Adjust 'RasterDataset' with the correct base class you expect for 'D'
    check_documentation('RasterDataset')
    print("Documentation check passed. The issue is fixed.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(0)
```

Before running this script, ensure it's placed at the root directory where the Sphinx documentation can be generated, and its paths (`sphinx-build` command's source and destination directories) are correctly set. Also, this script assumes the presence of a HTML file (`_build/html/api/datasets.html`) generated by Sphinx; you may need to adjust file paths based on your actual documentation structure.
