Creating a `reproducer.py` script to programmatically reproduce a specific issue involving Sphinx document generation without directly executing the `sphinx-build` command (due to potential path or environment issues as previous attempts resulted in errors) can be nuanced, because it usually requires a setup that's environmental-specific and also depends on having the Sphinx environment correctly installed and configured.

However, what we can try is to use Python to replicate the conditions that cause the issue, and then programmatically generate and search the Sphinx documentation output for the correct base class. This script will use Sphinx's API to initiate a build directly. It's a more controlled way to attempt to reproduce the documentation generation issue and search for the incorrect base class listing, circumventing the environmental dependency on having `sphinx-build` available directly in the shell path.

First, ensure Sphinx is installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`) and adjust the script to match your actual project layout and expectations as needed.

```python
import os
import sys
from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def generate_sphinx_docs(source_dir, build_dir):
    os.makedirs(build_dir, exist_ok=True)
    app = Sphinx(
        srcdir=source_dir,
        confdir=source_dir,
        outdir=os.path.join(build_dir, 'html'),
        doctreedir=os.path.join(build_dir, 'doctrees'),
        buildername='html'
    )
    app.build(force_all=True)

def check_documentation(base_class_name, documentation_path):
    if not os.path.exists(documentation_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Documentation HTML file not found: {documentation_path}")

    with open(documentation_path, 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()

    if base_class_name not in contents:
        raise AssertionError(f"Base class {base_class_name} not found in the generated documentation")

try:
    # Replace 'source' and 'build' with the correct directories for your sphinx project
    source_dir = 'docs'  # Adjust this to your Sphinx documentation source directory
    build_dir = '_build' # The output directory for sphinx build
    generate_sphinx_docs(source_dir, build_dir)

    # Modify the file path and base class as necessary to match the specifics of your project
    documentation_path = os.path.join(build_dir, 'html', 'api', 'datasets.html') # Example path
    expected_base_class = 'RasterDataset'  # Adjust this to the actual expected base class
    check_documentation(expected_base_class, documentation_path)

    print("Documentation check passed. The issue is fixed.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(0)
```

This script initializes a Sphinx application in Python and builds the documentation. It then checks the generated HTML file for the presence of the expected base class. Adjust paths (`source_dir`, `build_dir`, and `documentation_path`) and the expected base class (`expected_base_class`) as needed to match your documentation structure and requirements.
