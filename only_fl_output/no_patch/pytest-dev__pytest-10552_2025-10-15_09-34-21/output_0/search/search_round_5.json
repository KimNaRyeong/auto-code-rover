Here are theoretical bug locations and intended behaviors to address the issue described:\n\n1. **Custom pytest Collection Hooks in conftest.py or pytest plugins**: If custom collection hooks modify how tests are collected, ensuring these hooks correctly handle static and class methods, especially when parametrized, would be crucial. Adjustments should ensure that `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` decorated tests, particularly with parametrization, are correctly identified and collected for execution.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Modify any custom collection hooks to explicitly check for and include static and class methods in the test suite, regardless of parametrization. This ensures consistency in test discovery and execution, adhering to user expectations.\n\n2. **Project-Specific Test Discovery Configuration**: The project may have specific configurations that inadvertently affect the discovery of certain pytest tests. Reviewing and adjusting these configurations to explicitly support or include `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` tests would address potential issues.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure pytest configurations (e.g., in `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml`) do not exclude static and class methods from discovery. Configuration should prioritize inclusivity of test methods, providing warnings or errors for unsupported cases to alert the user.\n\n3. **Improvements to Test Definitions or pytest Decorator Application**: Misapplication or misunderstanding of `@staticmethod`/`@classmethod` with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` could lead to the observed behavior. Ensuring correct application and possibly contributing documentation or examples might prevent such issues.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Provide clear examples and documentation on the correct order and application of pytest markers and Python decorators to prevent discovery or execution issues. Encourage best practices in test definition.\n\n4. **Contribution to pytest Documentation or Codebase for Enhanced Warnings/Errors**: Given the silent failures and lack of warnings for certain use cases, contributing improvements to pytest\u2019s documentation or even its codebase to handle these specific cases more gracefully would be beneficial.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Enhance pytest to issue warnings or errors when test methods are defined with `@classmethod` or `@staticmethod` in a manner that could prevent their execution, guiding users towards compatible configurations.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile specific code locations and projects files remain unidentified without direct search results, the resolution strategy involves reviewing and adjusting custom pytest configurations, ensuring correct usage of decorators and markers, and possibly contributing to the pytest framework to handle similar cases more explicitly. This approach aims to address the underlying issue through best practices and improved feedback mechanisms.\n"

This widespread use indicates that parameterized tests are a common practice within the project, which could either contribute to or help diagnose the inconsistency issue reported with `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in pytest discovery and running.\n\n### 1. Analysis of `@pytest.mark.parametrize` Usage\n\n- **What it does**: The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is used to run a single test function multiple times with different arguments. It's a powerful tool for achieving thorough test coverage with minimal code.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue involves `@pytest.mark.parametrize` used in conjunction with `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`. Since the search revealed a wide use of `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, it suggests that if there's a systematic issue or inconsistency with how pytest handles these decorators together, it could potentially affect numerous tests across the project.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, using `@pytest.mark.parametrize` with static or class methods should allow for flexible, comprehensive test scenarios without compromising discovery or execution. The project should ensure these tests are consistently recognized and executed by pytest without warnings or missed executions.\n\n### 2. Given the Specific Files and Matches\n\nGiven the spread across files like `testing/test_terminal.py`, `testing/test_assertrewrite.py`, `testing/test_doctest.py`, etc., and especially noting the occurrence in `src/_pytest/python.py` and `src/_pytest/mark/structures.py`, there are a few potential action paths:\n\n- **Review Specific Implementations**: Files with high match counts, notably `testing/python/metafunc.py` (41 matches) and `testing/python/collect.py` (26 matches), are key candidates for review. They likely contain a variety of patterns that could exemplify correct or problematic uses of the decorators in question.\n\n- **Examine Pytest Internal Handling**: Since there's a match in `src/_pytest/python.py`, it's crucial to review how pytest internally handles decorated test functions, especially around `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, to ensure it supports or correctly warns about `staticmethod` and `classmethod`.\n\n### 3. Next Steps for Context Gathering\n\nGiven the inability of the search for `test_` methods likely due to the broad wildcard nature of the query, refining the approach to target more specific instances or patterns might yield better insights. Possible steps include:\n\n- **Narrowing Search Scope**: Instead of a broad search for `test_`, focusing on specific, problematic patterns noted in the issue might help. Searching for explicit use cases like static or class methods directly related to test definitions could reveal more.\n\n- **Search for Configuration or Hook Implementations**: Since pytest's behavior can be extended or modified with hooks and configurations, searching for implementations or uses of relevant hooks (`pytest_collection_modifyitems`, `pytest_generate_tests`, etc.) could provide insights into whether there's project-specific logic affecting the discovery and running of tests.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe broad use of `@pytest.mark.parametrize` suggests its fundamental role in testing within the project, making it critical to identify and correct any inconsistencies in how pytest handles these tests, especially when combined with class-level decorators. The next steps involve a more granular review of high-match files and pytest internals, combined with targeted searches for configuration or custom logic potentially influencing the observed behavior."

If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

        "content": "Based on the provided context and analysis, without concrete search API results for specific instances of pytest's handling of static and class methods marked for parametrization, and in the absence of search results pinpointing exactly where the inconsistency happens, it's challenging to specify exact bug locations and intended behavior changes needed to resolve the issue. However, I can outline a general approach towards resolution based on common practices and known pytest mechanisms:\n\n### General Approach for Resolution\n\n1. **Review and Test Parametrization Handling in Key Files**: It would be prudent to manually review the use of `@pytest.mark.parametrize` within the files that have shown a high number of matches, especially within the testing suite (e.g., `testing/python/metafunc.py`, `testing/python/collect.py`). However, without specific issues identified in these searches, we suggest a hypothetical approach rather than concrete fixes:\n\n   - **Files**: \n     - `src/_pytest/python.py`\n     - `src/_pytest/mark/structures.py`\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that these files contain logic that explicitly supports discovering and running tests defined with `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`, when combined with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`. This might involve adding or refining logic that introspects test methods to correctly handle methods decorated as class or static methods, ensuring they're correctly collected and executed as test cases.\n\n2. **Pytest Documentation and Community Input**: Considering no specific bug locations have been identified from the search results, engaging with the pytest documentation and community (e.g., GitHub Issues, Stack Overflow) regarding this issue may reveal known limitations or workarounds. Furthermore, it could highlight whether this behavior is an undocumented feature or an oversight in pytest's design.\n\n### Hypothetical Resolution Steps (without specific bug locations):\n\n- **Enhance Test Discovery Logic in Pytest**: Amend the test discovery process (`src/_pytest/python.py`) to better handle or explicitly warn about the use of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` with parametrization. This would involve introspecting method decorators during test collection and ensuring they're adequately wrapped or recognized for what they are\u2014test cases that need to be executed.\n\n- **Documentation or Warning Improvement**: Update pytest documentation to clearly state the expected behavior and limitations on using `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` with the parametrize decorator. If technical limitations prevent these methods from being run as expected when parametrized, clear warning messages should be added to the pytest collection process to inform users of potential non-execution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile specific bug locations cannot be pinpointed due to the breadth of the issue and the high-level nature of the provided context, these general steps represent a strategic approach to addressing the described inconsistency. It underscores the need for a detailed review of pytest's handling of test discovery and execution, potentially leading to codebase enhancements or clearer documentation for users."
