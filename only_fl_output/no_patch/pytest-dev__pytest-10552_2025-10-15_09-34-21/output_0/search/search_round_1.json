Since the direct search for `TestFoo` and specific method patterns did not return any results, it\u2019s possible the naming convention or decorator usage might vary slightly. Alternatively, the issue might have been reported for a test pattern that\u2019s not yet committed or present under a different name. Let\u2019s try broadening the search parameters to catch any similar usage or configurations that might lead to the issue described.\n\n2.

Therefore, searching for custom pytest fixture definitions, configurations, or hooks in the codebase could provide insights into how test discovery and execution are customized or extended.\n\n3. Explore if there's a custom plugin or configuration file (`conftest.py`) that adjusts the behavior of pytest, especially concerning test method collection and execution.\n\n### Adjusted API Calls\n\n- Search for any pytest configuration files or common test setup files that might influence test discovery:\n  - `search_file(\"conftest.py\")`\n  - `search_code(\"pytest_configure\")`\n  - `search_code(\"pytest_collection_modifyitems\")`\n\n- Broaden the search for any use of pytest decorators that may hint at customized or unconventional usage, which might indirectly relate to the issue:\n  - `search_code(\"@pytest.mark\")`\n\n- Given the absence of `TestFoo` and specific method patterns, let's broaden the search for any class containing `test_` methods to understand the testing structure better:\n  - `search_code(\"class Test\")`\n\n- Additionally, searching for documentation or comments in the codebase related to pytest test discovery might reveal intentions or known issues:\n  - `search_code(\"#\")` to search for comments that might discuss test discovery issues or related workarounds.\n\nThese adjusted API calls aim to provide a broader context regarding how pytest is configured and used within the project, which might uncover patterns or configurations leading to the inconsistencies described in the issue."

Given that no specific files or configurations were identified, it's recommended to review any project-specific pytest plugins, hooks, or configurations that may affect test discovery and execution.\n\n2. **Appropriate warnings or errors are generated when pytest encounters test methods it cannot execute.** This involves enhancing feedback to the user when a test method is not collected or executed due to its definition, which could be part of pytest's test collection phase.
