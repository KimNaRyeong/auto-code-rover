To directly address the misunderstanding and focus on creating a reproducible example targeted at the described issue (Django 'runserver' incorrectly handling HTTP HEAD requests by returning response bodies in versions following #26052), below is an adjusted version of `reproducer.py`. This script aims to perform the desired test, assuming you have an operational Django setup as described in your scenario:

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import time
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_head_request():
    response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')
    if 'Content-Length' in response.headers:
        if int(response.headers['Content-Length']) > 0:
            raise AssertionError("HEAD request erroneously returned a Content-Length header with a value greater than 0.")
    if response.content:
        raise AssertionError("HEAD request mistakenly returned a body.")
        
def main():
    try:
        make_head_request()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if issue is present

    print("Issue not detected, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if no issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'manage.py', 'runserver'])
    print("Starting Django development server...")
    
    # Allow some time for the development server to start
    time.sleep(5)  # Adjust this value if necessary based on your environment

    try:
        main()
    finally:
        # Attempt to terminate the Django development server gracefully
        process.terminate()
        try:
            process.wait(timeout=10)
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            print("Django development server did not terminate gracefully, attempting to kill.")
            process.kill()
```

This script attempts to:

1. Start the Django development server using a subprocess.
2. Wait for an arbitrary time (5 seconds) to ensure the server is up and running. This might need to be adjusted depending on the system's performance.
3. Make an HTTP HEAD request to the root URL and assess the response for the presence of content or a `Content-Length` header indicating the presence of a body, which should not occur with HEAD requests as per HTTP specifications.
4. If an issue is detected, the script prints a stack trace and exits with an error code (1). If no issue is detected, it exits cleanly with code 0.
5. Finally, regardless of the outcome, it attempts to shut down the Django development server gracefully.

Please ensure that requests is installed (`pip install requests`) and adjust the sleep time if your server requires more time to start.
