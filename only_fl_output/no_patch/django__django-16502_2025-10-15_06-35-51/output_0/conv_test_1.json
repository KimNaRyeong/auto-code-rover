(In certain configurations this also results in \"Broken pipe\" error messages in runserver output, since compliant user agents expect to be able to terminate the connection after the headers are sent.)\nSTR:\n1) mkvirtualenv django-test\n2) pip install 'Django>1.10,<1.11'\n3) django-admin startproject django-test\n4) cd django-test\n5) ./manage.py runserver\n6) In another terminal, run curl -iX HEAD http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n7) Observe response from curl\nExpected:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nActual:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\"><title>Welcome to Django</title>\n...\nTested with Python 2.7.13 and 3.4.5.\nDoesn't reproduce under Django 1.9.13.\n"

This script assumes you have a Django project setup with the name `django_test` and it is structured according to Django's default structure. If your project has a different name or structure, you'll need to modify the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable and possibly other parts of the script accordingly.\n   \n2. The script uses `subprocess` to spawn a new process for running Django's development server (`runserver` command). This process runs in a separate thread from the main Python script, which is used to send the HTTP HEAD request.\n\n3. The use of `http.client` is to directly control and inspect HTTP requests and responses. This is necessary to check the presence of a response body in an HTTP HEAD request.\n\n4. The script includes simple error handling and uses a custom function to print detailed stack traces when exceptions occur.\n\n5. The `time.sleep(5)` call is used to provide the Django server with enough time to fully start up before the script attempts to send requests to it. You may need to adjust this sleep duration based on your system's performance.\n\n6. Do not forget to replace `django_test.settings` in the `start_django_server()` function with the appropriate settings module of your Django project."
