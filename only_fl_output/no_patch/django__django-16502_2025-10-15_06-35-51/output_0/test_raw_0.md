Below is an example `reproducer.py` script which aims to automate the testing of the reported issue. This script will execute a Django runserver in a separate thread, perform an HTTP HEAD request to the root of the server, then analyze the response to check if the body is present when it shouldn't be, indicating the issue is present.

```python
import threading
import sys
import os
import subprocess
import time
import http.client

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def start_django_server():
    """
    This function starts the Django development server.
    It is meant to be run in a separate thread to allow the main thread
    to perform HTTP requests to the server.
    """
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_test.settings')
    subprocess.call(['python', 'manage.py', 'runserver'])

def check_http_head_response():
    """
    This function checks the response from an HTTP HEAD request.
    It expects that the response will not include a body. If a body
    is present, it raises an AssertionError.
    """
    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection('127.0.0.1', 8000)
    conn.request('HEAD', '/')
    response = conn.getresponse()
    body = response.read()
    if body:
        raise AssertionError("Response body should not be present for HTTP HEAD requests.")

# Main execution flow
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Ensure Django is installed
    try:
        import django
    except ImportError:
        print("Django must be installed to run this script.")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print("Starting Django server...")
    server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_django_server)
    server_thread.daemon = True
    server_thread.start()
    time.sleep(5)  # Provide ample time for the server to start

    try:
        check_http_head_response()
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Issue detected.")
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        server_thread.join(1)
```

**Notes:**

1. This script assumes you have a Django project setup with the name `django_test` and it is structured according to Django's default structure. If your project has a different name or structure, you'll need to modify the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable and possibly other parts of the script accordingly.
   
2. The script uses `subprocess` to spawn a new process for running Django's development server (`runserver` command). This process runs in a separate thread from the main Python script, which is used to send the HTTP HEAD request.

3. The use of `http.client` is to directly control and inspect HTTP requests and responses. This is necessary to check the presence of a response body in an HTTP HEAD request.

4. The script includes simple error handling and uses a custom function to print detailed stack traces when exceptions occur.

5. The `time.sleep(5)` call is used to provide the Django server with enough time to fully start up before the script attempts to send requests to it. You may need to adjust this sleep duration based on your system's performance.

6. Do not forget to replace `django_test.settings` in the `start_django_server()` function with the appropriate settings module of your Django project.
