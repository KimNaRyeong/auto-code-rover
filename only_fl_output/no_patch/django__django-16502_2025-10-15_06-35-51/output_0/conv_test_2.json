(In certain configurations this also results in \"Broken pipe\" error messages in runserver output, since compliant user agents expect to be able to terminate the connection after the headers are sent.)\nSTR:\n1) mkvirtualenv django-test\n2) pip install 'Django>1.10,<1.11'\n3) django-admin startproject django-test\n4) cd django-test\n5) ./manage.py runserver\n6) In another terminal, run curl -iX HEAD http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n7) Observe response from curl\nExpected:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nActual:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\"><title>Welcome to Django</title>\n...\nTested with Python 2.7.13 and 3.4.5.\nDoesn't reproduce under Django 1.9.13.\n"

        "content": "Given your request for a corrected script that would appropriately reproduce the reported issue and exit correctly based on its presence, please find below an updated version of `reproducer.py`. This updated script better handles the environment setup and error catching, aiming to reliably reproduce the issue with Django's `runserver` not stripping the response body for `HEAD` requests as expected:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport requests\nimport threading\n\ndef run_django_server():\n    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'django_test.settings')\n    subprocess.run(['python', 'manage.py', 'runserver'])\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_head_request():\n    response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')\n    content_length = response.headers.get('Content-Length', 0)\n    if int(content_length) > 0:\n        raise AssertionError(\"HEAD request returned body content\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Checking prerequisites\n    if not os.path.isfile('manage.py'):\n        print(\"This script must be run from the root of a Django project where 'manage.py' is located.\")\n        exit(1)\n\n    # Start server in background thread\n    server_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_django_server)\n    server_thread.daemon = True\n    server_thread.start()\n    print(\"Django server starting...\")\n\n    # Allow server some time to start\n    time.sleep(5)  # Adjust time as necessary\n\n    try:\n        test_head_request()  # Perform the test\n        print(\"Test passed: No issue detected, server behaves as expected.\")\n        sys.exit(0)\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print(\"Test failed: Issue detected.\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Unexpected error occurred during the test.\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n**Instructions for Use:**\n\n1. **Project Requirement**: This script assumes it's placed at the root of a Django project (where `manage.py` resides). It attempts to modify the Django environment variable to point to your project's settings module, which you might need to adjust according to your project's configuration.\n\n2. **Dependencies**: Ensure Django and Requests are installed in your environment (`pip install Django requests`).\n\n3. **Execution**: Run this script using Python 3 in the root directory of your Django project.\n\n**How It Works**:\n\n- The script starts a Django development server on a background thread using Django's `manage.py runserver`.\n- It waits for a few seconds to ensure the server has started.\n- Performs an HTTP HEAD request to the root of the server.\n- Checks the `Content-Length` header to assert body content length. An error is raised if content is present when it shouldn't be, according to the HTTP specification for HEAD requests.\n- Properly handles unexpected errors and prints detailed stack traces for diagnostics.\n\n**Note**:\n\n- The `time.sleep(5)` is a naive way to wait for the server to start. It could be replaced with more sophisticated checks to see if the server is up.\n- This script uses the `requests` library for simplicity and readability over `http.client` or similar lower-level libraries."
