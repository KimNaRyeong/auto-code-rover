        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `update_scalarmappable` should be modified or extended to correctly handle the scenario when `norm` is updated, especially after a colorbar has been created. It should ensure that any change in the normalization, such as switching to `LogNorm` with new `vmin` and `vmax` values, is validated and applied without causing an `Invalid vmin or vmax` error. This includes re-validating `vmin` and `vmax` whenever `norm` is updated, and properly updating the internal state to reflect these changes. The method must maintain its role in adjusting the scalar mappable's color mapping to match the current states accurately, ensuring that updates to normalization parameters do not disrupt the integrity of the plot's visual representation. The validation logic might require a closer examination to ensure it accommodates `LogNorm`'s requirements, possibly with adjustments or additional checks specifically tailored to logarithmic normalization."

        "method": "pcolormesh",
        "intended_behavior": "Given that the `pcolormesh` method is central to setting up the mesh plot to which normalization applies, ensuring that it can gracefully handle dynamic updates to normalization parameters is crucial. While the method itself may not be directly buggy, enhancing its interaction mechanism with normalization objects such as `LogNorm` could be key to addressing the issue. This might involve ensuring that changes to the plot's normalization are propagated effectively to related components like the colorbar, possibly through a more dynamic or responsive update signaling mechanism within the plot object itself. This could ensure that subsequent updates to normalization after initial plot creation are correctly applied and reflected in the plot and associated colorbar, preserving the existing functionality while enabling the dynamic adjustment capabilities needed."
