Additionally, it corrects the condition for detecting and throwing an `AssertionError` based on the presence of the bug.

This test script attempts to simulate an environment where the reported Sphinx documentation issue could be verified.

Conversely, if the backslash does not appear (implying the issue is fixed or not present), it exits with code 0, signaling success."
