Given the feedback that the previous script did not reproduce the issue correctly due to a missing `sphinx-build` command, and considering the constraints provided, I am crafting a revised Python script. This iteration includes an explicit check to ensure that `sphinx-build` is available in the system's PATH before attempting to execute the Sphinx documentation build process. Additionally, it corrects the condition for detecting and throwing an `AssertionError` based on the presence of the bug. This script assumes that `sphinx-build` is installed and accessible in your environment. If not, you'll need to install Sphinx via `pip install Sphinx` or ensure it's correctly setup in your conda environment.

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import os
import shutil
import re

def sphinx_build_available():
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(["sphinx-build", "--version"])
        return True
    except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError):
        return False

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_output_does_not_contain_escaped_underscore(output_path):
    with open(output_path, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        # Return True if the bug is NOT present, i.e., there is no overescaped underscore
        return not re.search(r"hello\\_", content)

try:
    if not sphinx_build_available():
        raise EnvironmentError("sphinx-build command is not found. Please ensure Sphinx is installed and available on the PATH.")
    
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        # Setup minimal Sphinx project
        os.makedirs(os.path.join(tmpdir, "source"))
        
        # Create conf.py
        conf_py = os.path.join(tmpdir, "source", "conf.py")
        with open(conf_py, "w") as f:
            f.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']\n")
            
        # Create index.rst
        index_rst = os.path.join(tmpdir, "source", "index.rst")
        with open(index_rst, "w") as f:
            f.write(".. autoclass:: a.A\n")
            
        # Create a.py
        a_py = os.path.join(tmpdir, "a.py")
        with open(a_py, "w") as f:
            f.write("""class A:\n    \"\"\"\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    hello_: int\n        hi\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n""")
            
        # Run sphinx-build
        build_dir = os.path.join(tmpdir, "build")
        subprocess.check_call([
            "sphinx-build",
            "-b",
            "html",
            os.path.join(tmpdir, "source"),
            build_dir,
        ], env={"PYTHONPATH": tmpdir})
        
        # Check output
        html_output = os.path.join(build_dir, "index.html")
        if not check_output_does_not_contain_escaped_underscore(html_output):
            raise AssertionError("The issue still persists: Attribute shows up with an overescaped trailing underscore.")
        
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)

print("Success: No issue detected. The undesired backslash does not appear.")
exit(0)
```

Before running the script, ensure that Sphinx is installed in your environment:

- If using pip: `pip install sphinx`
- If using conda: `conda install sphinx`

Then, place this script in the root directory of your project and run it with Python 3. This test script attempts to simulate an environment where the reported Sphinx documentation issue could be verified. It looks for the presence of the "overescaped trailing underscore" in attribute names within generated Sphinx HTML documentation. If the undesired backslash is found, indicating that the issue has not been resolved, the script throws an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the backslash does not appear (implying the issue is fixed or not present), it exits with code 0, signaling success.
