Let's outline what we're looking for:\n\n1. The implementation (or lack thereof) of checks for `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in the `ModelAdmin` class.\n2. The details of how `ManyToManyField`, particularly with the `through` parameter, is implemented or validated.\n\nBased on this, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. To find out where `ModelAdmin` is defined and to understand how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are handled:\n   - `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n2. To see how `ManyToManyField` is implemented, especially concerning the `through` argument:\n   - `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`\n\n3. Additionally, since the issue suggests system checks might be missing or improperly handling cases where `ManyToManyField` uses `through`, we should locate where Django's system checks for model fields are defined. Given the broad nature of system checks, we look for a relevant method or class regarding system checks for fields:\n   - `search_method(\"check\")`\n\nThese calls will provide us with locations in the Django codebase that are likely relevant to the reported issue. We can then use these locations to get more specific code context or decide on the appropriate place to implement a new system check."

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context to understand how it relates to the issue and what changes might be necessary to resolve it.\n\n### Analysis of `ModelAdmin`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `ModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` is responsible for defining the admin interface for a model. It includes configurations and methods for how model instances are listed, edited, and displayed in the Django admin. Notably, it supports `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` attributes for enhancing the UI when dealing with `ManyToManyField` relationships. However, from the provided code snippet and issue description, there isn't an explicit mention of handling or validating the use of these attributes specifically when a `ManyToManyField` includes a custom `through` model.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe issue is that `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` do not work as expected (or at all) when a `ManyToManyField` is defined with a custom `through` model. The `ModelAdmin` code provided doesn't show any checks or warnings when these filters are used in conjunction with such ManyToMany relationships.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, `ModelAdmin` should include a system check that warns or errors when `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` are used with a `ManyToManyField` that specifies a `through` model, as this combination is not supported by Django's admin. This would prevent confusion and save developers time by making the limitation explicit.\n\n### Analysis of `ManyToManyField`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `ManyToManyField` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` defines the behavior and setup of many-to-many relationships between Django models. This includes the initialization of the field, with parameters that define the relationship, such as `through`, `to`, and others. The class contains methods to check the field's configuration (`check` method), contribute to the model class it's part of, and handle related operations in the ORM layer.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe `ManyToManyField` class specifies handling and configuration for `through` models, but based on the provided code and issue, it doesn't seem to include a direct warning or error mechanism within its checks related to the usage with `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` in the Django admin. This is where the limitation arises and where enhancements could be implemented to catch the misconfiguration.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe `ManyToManyField` should ideally include checks that specifically catch when it is used with `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` in a `ModelAdmin` context and has a custom `through` model defined. These checks could then trigger warnings or errors during the system checks that occur at startup, improving developer awareness of this limitation.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue description and the analysis of the relevant code parts:\n\n1. One approach to resolving this issue could be to implement additional checks in either the `ModelAdmin` setup process or directly in the `ManyToManyField`'s `check` method to specifically address this configuration and guide developers appropriately. Such checks would need to assess the existence and configuration of `ManyToManyField` relations within any `ModelAdmin` instance that utilizes `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`.\n\n2. We need to further analyze `ModelAdminChecks` within `ModelAdmin`, as it's mentioned in the code snippet but wasn't specifically covered by the search results. This would likely be where the new check logic could be most appropriately added. Searching for `ModelAdminChecks` might provide insight into how system checks are currently implemented and where our new logic could fit.\n\n3. We also need to understand better where and how `check` methods across models and fields are invoked, particularly for system checks related to admin configuration. This could further clarify how to integrate a new check efficiently.\n\nImplementing such a change would involve creating a patch that adds these specific checks, ensuring they're triggered at the correct phase of application initialization or admin setup, providing clear feedback to the developer when this unsupported configuration is detected.\n"

This new check should iterate over the model fields to identify any `ManyToManyField` using a custom `through` model if `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` are configured. If such a case is detected, raise a system check error warning the developer that `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` cannot be used with `ManyToManyField` instances that have a custom `through` model.

While it's not directly accessing the admin configurations in this layer, it can include a warning or documentation hint suggesting that developers ensure compatibility with `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` when using a custom `through` model. This change would indirectly address the issue by guiding developers during model field configuration, although the primary solution would be more direct checks within the admin framework as specified in Bug Location 1.\n\nThese enhancements will preserve current functionality while ensuring that developers are warned or blocked from proceeding with configurations that are known to be incompatible, thereby preventing confusion and wasted developer time as described in the issue."
