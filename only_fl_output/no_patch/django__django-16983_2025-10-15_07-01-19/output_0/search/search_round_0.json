        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the system check for `filter_horizontal`/`filter_vertical` on `ManyToManyField` instances that specify an intermediary model through the `through` attribute, we need to find relevant sections of the Django codebase. Let's outline what we're looking for:\n\n1. The implementation (or lack thereof) of checks for `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in the `ModelAdmin` class.\n2. The details of how `ManyToManyField`, particularly with the `through` parameter, is implemented or validated.\n\nBased on this, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. To find out where `ModelAdmin` is defined and to understand how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are handled:\n   - `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n2. To see how `ManyToManyField` is implemented, especially concerning the `through` argument:\n   - `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`\n\n3. Additionally, since the issue suggests system checks might be missing or improperly handling cases where `ManyToManyField` uses `through`, we should locate where Django's system checks for model fields are defined. Given the broad nature of system checks, we look for a relevant method or class regarding system checks for fields:\n   - `search_method(\"check\")`\n\nThese calls will provide us with locations in the Django codebase that are likely relevant to the reported issue. We can then use these locations to get more specific code context or decide on the appropriate place to implement a new system check."
