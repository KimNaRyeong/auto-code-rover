        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the inconsistency and potential issues with `SimpleLazyObject`s mentioned in the issue, the `get_context_data` method could be enhanced to check for `SimpleLazyObject` within the `kwargs` and evaluate them before returning the context dictionary. This would prevent the \"Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type\" error by ensuring all lazily-evaluated objects are fully realized when passed to the context, thus making them safe to use within templates or further processing within the view.\n\nA careful approach is needed to ensure this change does not inadvertently force evaluation of all lazy objects unnecessarily, which could have performance implications or unintended side effects. Ideally, this change would be accompanied by documentation updates to clarify how `kwargs` are handled and potential implications for developers."
