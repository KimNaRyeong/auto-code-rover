        "content": "Based on the API call results, let's analyze the collected context in relation to the issue described:\n\n1. **TemplateView and ListView Classes**:\n   - The `TemplateView` class in `django/views/generic/base.py` is mentioned without the `get_context_data` method directly visible in the snippet provided. Similarly, the `ListView` class is found in `django/views/generic/list.py` without directly showing the `get_context_data` method. This indicates that either these methods are inherited and not overridden in these base classes, or the search might have needed to target where these methods are implemented more specifically, like in mixins or parent classes.\n\n2. **Absence of `get_context_data` In Specific Search**:\n   - The search did not find `get_context_data` directly within `TemplateView` or `ListView`, which suggests that the implementations of these methods are likely inherited from their ancestor classes (`ContextMixin` for `TemplateView` and possibly a similar mixin or base class for `ListView`). For `TemplateView`, since it's combined with `ContextMixin`, the actual implementation detail lies within this mixin. For `ListView`, it implies that further investigation into its parent classes or related mixins is necessary.\n\n3. **Usage of `kwargs.get` Across the Codebase**:\n   - The search for `kwargs.get` yielded 28 snippets across various files, but none directly within the `TemplateView` or `ListView` implementations or their direct methods. This broad usage across the project showcases the common pattern of accessing keyword arguments safely. However, specifically regarding the issue at hand, it points to a need for understanding how `kwargs` passed to `get_context_data` are being handled uniformly or differently across view types. The issue description suggests a problem when `kwargs` contain a `SimpleLazyObject` that isn't handled correctly when passed from the URL dispatcher.\n\nGiven the current context, further steps could include:\n\n1. **Investigate `ContextMixin`**:\n   - Since `TemplateView` is a combination of `TemplateResponseMixin`, `ContextMixin`, and `View`, and the search didn't directly return the implementation of `get_context_data`, it would be valuable to search for the `get_context_data` method within `ContextMixin` itself to understand how `kwargs` are being integrated into the context.\n\n2. **Review Base Classes for `ListView`**:\n   - Similarly, for `ListView`, further exploration into `MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin` and `BaseListView` might reveal how `get_context_data` is implemented and whether or not it similarly integrates `kwargs` into the context, or if there's a distinct approach that excludes `kwargs`.\n\nThese analyses are crucial for resolving the inconsistency described in the issue. The intended behavior, based on the issue, is likely to either standardize how `kwargs` are passed into `get_context_data` across different views or to provide clear guidelines and mechanisms for handling special cases like `SimpleLazyObject`, ensuring stable and expected behavior across Django versions."

The inconsistency requires an alignment or modification in how `kwargs` are processed and added to the context by the `get_context_data` method across these or related classes. Without additional context, specific locations for changes are not fully determinable yet.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\n\n- **For `TemplateView` in `ContextMixin`** (assuming further context supports this location): The `get_context_data` method should either standardize the handling of `kwargs` to ensure that objects like `SimpleLazyObject` are correctly handled (e.g., by ensuring they are evaluated or converted to their base types before being passed into context). This might involve inspecting `kwargs` more closely and implementing a safety check or conversion for known problematic data types.\n\n- **For `ListView` and associated Mixins**: Depending on the findings from `MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin`, the intended behavior might involve aligning its `get_context_data` method's handling of `kwargs` with whatever resolution is applied to `TemplateView` to ensure consistency. If `ListView` doesn't inherently push `kwargs` into context in the same way, a decision should be made whether to align it with `TemplateView` by explicitly doing so or clarifying in documentation the differences in behavior and providing guidelines for developers on managing `kwargs` and `context` consistently across view types.\n\nThese adjustments would preserve the existing functionality while addressing the inconsistency and potential crash issue described in the original problem statement."
