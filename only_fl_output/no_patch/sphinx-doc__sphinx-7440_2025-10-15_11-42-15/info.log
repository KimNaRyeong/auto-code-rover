This would resolve the Sphinx build error regarding duplicate term descriptions. If these terms are meant to illustrate different concepts (which is unlikely given the context), then a clarification in the glossary entry to distinctly differentiate the terms would be necessary. The documentation should clearly define each term with enough context to avoid confusion and ensure the Sphinx build process completes without errors related to duplicate definitions."
