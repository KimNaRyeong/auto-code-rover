It's tripped me up on more than one occasion, and it seems a trivial feature to support, from my limited testing.\n>>> from django.template import Template, Context\n>>> tmpl = Template('{% include var %}')\n>>> ctx = Context({'var':'admin/base.html'})\n>>> ctx\n[{'var': 'admin/base.html'}]\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\n... some HTML output ...\n>>> ctx.update({'var':['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']})\n{'var': ['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']}\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 140, in render\nreturn self._render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 134, in _render\nreturn self.nodelist.render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 823, in render\nbit = self.render_node(node, context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/debug.py\", line 74, in render_node\nreturn node.render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader_tags.py\", line 165, in render\ntemplate = get_template(template_name)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader.py\", line 145, in get_template\ntemplate, origin = find_template(template_name)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader.py\", line 138, in find_template\nraise TemplateDoesNotExist(name)\nTemplateDoesNotExist: ['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']\nThe 'fix' is to change \u200bthis line from get_template to select_template, though this might now be slightly complicated by the recent changes in 5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c to allow for rendering of Template instances.\nChanging to select_template on 1.4 yields the results I'd expect:\n>>> from django.template import Template, Context\n>>> tmpl = Template('{% include var %}')\n>>> ctx = Context({'var':['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']})\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\n... some HTML output ...\nBoth the above shell sessions assume django.contrib.admin is in INSTALLED_APPS.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of the `{% include %}` template tag, the `get_template` method, and potentially the `select_template` method, as well as any recent changes that might affect the proposed fix. Here are the API calls that we should make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for where the `{% include %}` template tag is implemented. Since this tag is likely defined within a class or a method, we'll first try to find its implementation details:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"{% include %}\")\n```\n\n2. We need to find the implementation of the `get_template` method to understand its current use:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"get_template\")\n```\n\n3. Similarly, we want to look at the `select_template` method implementation because the issue suggests changing from `get_template` to `select_template`:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"select_template\")\n```\n\n4. The traceback in the issue description mentions specific files and methods (`loader_tags.py` at `render` method and `loader.py` at `get_template` method). We can fetch more context around these mentions to understand their implementations and how they're currently used:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method_in_file(\"render\", \"django/template/loader_tags.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/loader.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of how `{% include %}` is implemented, how `get_template` and `select_template` are used within the Django framework, and any potential implications or considerations for swapping `get_template` with `select_template`."
