        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the deprecation warning with Python 3.12\u2019s `shutil.rmtree`, the `rm_rf` function should be updated to support the new `onexc` parameter instead of `onerror`. This means adapting the call to `rmtree` and possibly the design of `on_rm_rf_error` to align with the new API expectations, ensuring errors during directory and file removal are handled appropriately. The functionality should ensure that when errors are encountered during removal, they are processed in a manner compatible with `onexc`, enabling custom error handling while preserving the behavior of safely removing files and directories, including handling read-only attribute errors."

        "method": "addDuration",
        "intended_behavior": "To comply with Python 3.12's updates, a new method named `addDuration` needs to be added to the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method would receive timing information about how long a test case took to execute. The `addDuration` method's role would be to update the test case result with the duration of execution, maintaining compatibility with Python 3.12\u2019s test suite expectations. It must be ensured that this update is compatible with how Pytest handles and reports test durations, effectively integrating with Pytest's existing test result reporting mechanisms. This addition will prevent the warning that occurs when Pytest runs under Python 3.12 with warnings treated as errors, ensuring smooth operation and compatibility."
