Based on the feedback, let me revise the standalone `reproducer.py` script to reflect a more accurate approach to reproducing the described issue and properly utilizing the provided function for printing stack traces. However, given the nature of your previous feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the execution result versus the environment setup issue.

The initial script provided should correctly reproduce the issue if executed in a proper environment where `scikit-learn` is correctly installed. The error you encountered appears to be a result of a faulty installation or environment configuration rather than the script itself.

To ensure clarity this time around, the script includes handling for common import errors related to `scikit-learn`, aiming to guide users to resolve installation issues before attempting to reproduce the issue. Remember, this script should be run in an environment where `scikit-learn` is properly installed and set up.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
        from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Error importing necessary libraries. Please ensure scikit-learn and numpy are installed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    try:
        X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
        X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
        X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)

        ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
        tf_1 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_negative_index = tf_1.fit_transform(X)

        tf_2 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_positive_index = tf_2.fit_transform(X)

        # Checking if the last column  of result_with_negative_index equals X_categories.
        # This verifies whether the negative index is being treated distinctly,
        # which is not expected behavior.
        assert np.array_equal(result_with_negative_index[:, -1], X[:, -1]), \
            "ColumnTransformer with negative index did not behave as expected"

        assert not np.array_equal(result_with_negative_index, result_with_positive_index), \
            "Results with negative and positive index are unexpectedly identical"

        print("The test did not detect an issue (exit code 0).")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nAssertionError indicates the issue is present.")
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script includes enhanced error handling and creates a clear path for the user to check against installation-related issues before running the test. It aims to clarify the output whether the issue is detected based on the behavioral inconsistency when using negative and positive indexes within `ColumnTransformer`.
