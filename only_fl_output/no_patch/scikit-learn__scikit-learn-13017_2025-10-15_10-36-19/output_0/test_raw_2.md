To ensure we address the situation according to the latest instructions and reflecting the need to identify whether the discrepancy related to handling negative indices in `ColumnTransformer` persists, I have written a Python script titled `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to be standalone, requiring only the execution environment to have `numpy` and `scikit-learn` installed.

The script precisely follows the steps you've outlined, aiming to use negative and positive indices within a `ColumnTransformer` setup and compare their outcomes. Upon detection of inconsistency or confirmation that the issue has been resolved, the script will behave as specified - raising an `AssertionError` if the issue persists and exiting cleanly with code 0 if the issue is fixed. Additionally, it incorporates the provided function for clear and informative stack trace printing in case of exceptions.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
import sys


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    try:
        X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
        X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
        X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)

        ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
        tf_1 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_negative_index = tf_1.fit_transform(X)

        tf_2 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_positive_index = tf_2.fit_transform(X)

        # Check if results are identical, implying the issue is resolved
        if np.array_equal(result_with_negative_index[:, :-1], result_with_positive_index):
            print("The issue seems to be resolved.", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Inconsistent behavior when using negative and positive indices.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run this script, save it as `reproducer.py` at the root directory of your project, ensure you have `numpy` and `scikit-learn` installed in your execution environment, and run it using the following command:
```shell
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script performs the essential checks and respects your instructions for error handling and exit codes. Upon execution, if the issue is present, you'll see an `AssertionError` with a clear stack trace, facilitated by the `print_stacktrace` function. If the behavior is as expected (meaning the issue has been addressed in the version of `scikit-learn` you are using), the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.
