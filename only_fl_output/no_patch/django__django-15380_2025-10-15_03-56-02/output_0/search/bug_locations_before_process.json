        "intended_behavior": "The method 'generate_renamed_fields' in the 'MigrationAutodetector' class should correctly handle scenarios where both a model and some of its fields are renamed between states ('from_state' and 'to_state'). To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality:\n\n- Before attempting to access 'self.to_state.models[app_label, old_model_name]', the method needs to ensure that 'old_model_name' is correctly resolved, taking into account any model renames that have occurred. This might involve improving the logic that maps old model names to new ones within the state transition, ensuring that any rename is accounted for before attempting to access the model's state.\n\n- Adjust the logic that detects and handles field renames in the context of a model rename. Ensure that when querying for a model's state, it uses the most current name (accounting for renames) to avoid 'KeyError'.\n\n- Implement additional checks or update the data structures that track model and field names throughout migrations to ensure consistency and prevent errors when accessing model states post-rename.\n\nThe fix should ensure that the migration autodetector can gracefully handle combinations of model and field renames without crashing, fully reflecting the intended changes in the generated migration operations."
