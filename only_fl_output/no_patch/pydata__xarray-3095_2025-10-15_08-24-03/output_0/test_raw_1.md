Given the complexity of the issue and the need for precision, let's adjust the reproducer script to accurately capture and report the dtype casting issue in xarray. Please find the updated version below:

```python
import xarray
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xarray.Dataset(
        coords={'x': ['foo'], 'y': ('x', ['bar'])},
        data_vars={'z': ('x', ['baz'])})

    # Output before copy
    print("Before copy:")
    print(ds)

    # Copy with deep=True
    ds_copy_deep = ds.copy(deep=True)

    # Assertion to check if dtype remains unchanged
    try:
        assert ds.x.dtype == ds_copy_deep.x.dtype, "Dtype changed after deep copy"
        print("After deep copy:\nDtype remains consistent. No regression detected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script initializes a sample `xarray.Dataset` object with specific data types for its indices and data variables. It then proceeds to copy this dataset using deep copying. The assertion checks if the dtype of the 'x' coordinate has been altered following the deep copy, which should not occur under normal circumstances and is indicative of the regression issue mentioned.

If the issue is present, the script will print a detailed stack trace pinpointing the failure point in the code, and exit with code 1 (indicating an error). Conversely, if the dtype remains consistent as expected, it will print a confirmation message and exit with code 0, indicating that the issue is resolved or not present.

Please adjust and run the above script in your environment to reproduce and diagnose the issue accordingly.
