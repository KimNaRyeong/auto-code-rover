        "content": "<issue>handle Decimal in json encoder\nThe `simplejson` removal (#3555) decreased the flask encoding capabilities as the built-in `json` doesn't cover cases like `Decimal` types. The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)\n```python\nfrom flask import json as fjson\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\nimport simplejson as sjson\nimport decimal\nfrom datetime import datetime\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\n```\nThe custom encoder:\n```python\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\n'''\nAdd Decimal coverage\n'''\ndef default(self, o):\nif isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\nreturn str(o)\nreturn super().default(o)\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\n```\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.8.10\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\n</issue>"
