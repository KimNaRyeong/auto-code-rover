        "intended_behavior": "The `default` method within the `JSONEncoder` class needs to be extended to handle `Decimal` types explicitly. This extension should preserve the existing functionality of the code for serializing dates, UUIDs, dataclasses, and objects with a `__html__` method while adding a new conditional branch to check for `decimal.Decimal` instances.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should be updated as follows:\n\n- Check if the object `o` is an instance of `decimal.Decimal`.\n- If so, return `str(o)` to convert the `Decimal` to a string that is JSON serializable. This approach mirrors how other specific types are handled within the method, ensuring that `Decimal` objects can be serialized without breaking compatibility with `datetime` objects or any other types currently supported.\n- This change allows both `Decimal` and `datetime` objects to be correctly serialized by Flask's built-in JSON encoding mechanisms, eliminating the need for workarounds that involve switching back to `simplejson` or writing custom encoders for common use cases."
