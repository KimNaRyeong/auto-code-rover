        "intended_behavior": "The code within `linkcheck.py` should correctly handle anchor parsing and matching in a way that is compatible with both GitHub's way of rendering reStructuredText documents (adding `user-content-` prefix to anchors) and traditional anchor naming. This implies the linkchecker logic should be robust enough to recognize and validate anchors in URLs regardless of whether they include the `user-content-` prefix or not. The existing functionality of checking links and anchors for correctness should be preserved while expanding its capability to understand and validate GitHub-specific anchor transformations. This could involve adding a pre-validation step or a normalization process for anchors before attempting to match them with targets in the checked document, ensuring compatibility with GitHub's anchor naming conventions without affecting its ability to validate other types of links and anchors."
