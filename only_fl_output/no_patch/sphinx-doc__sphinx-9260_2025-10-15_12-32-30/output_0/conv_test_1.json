You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\r\n\r\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\nAndreas.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\r\n```html\r\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\r\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\r\n```\r\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\r\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct. \r\n\r\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- Python version: 3.9.2\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\r\n- Firefox: 86.0\r\n\n"

        "content": "Certainly, to address the specifics of reproducing the described issue with a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`, one needs to simulate the behavior of the Sphinx linkchecker, especially as it pertains to handling and verifying anchors in HTML documents derived from GitHub-rendered reStructuredText. The original issue suggests a discrepancy in how anchors are checked or interpreted by the tool.\n\nGiven the constraints and goals outlined, the `reproducer.py` script provided below attempts to mimic the actions of fetching an HTML page, parsing it to find specific anchors, and verifying their existence according to the behavior described in the issue. However, it's important to note that a complete replication of the Sphinx linkchecker's environment or internal logic might require more context or dependencies than provided in this simplified script. This script focuses on the core aspect of fetching and checking anchors in HTML to illustrate the issue.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef check_anchor(url, anchor):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        raise Exception(f\"Failed to fetch URL: {url}\")\n\n    page_content = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    anchor_tag = page_content.find(id=anchor)\n    if anchor_tag is None:\n        # Attempt to find using 'name' attribute for compatibility\n        anchor_tag = page_content.find(attrs={\"name\": anchor})\n\n    assert anchor_tag is not None, f\"Anchor '{anchor}' not found in {url}\"\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        # Original anchor that worked previously\n        check_anchor(\"https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst\", \"make-changes\")\n        \n        # New anchor that works due to GitHub's rendering change\n        check_anchor(\"https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst\", \"user-content-make-changes\")\n        \n        print(\"Both anchors were successfully found.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An unexpected error occurred.\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n```\n\nRemember, to execute this script, you'll need Python 3 and the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` packages installed in your environment. This script makes real HTTP requests to the specified URL and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and look for the specified anchors. If an anchor is not found, an `AssertionError` is raised, triggering the printing of the stack trace as requested."
