Given the issue description, we are interested in the `LabelEncoder` class and its `transform` method because the traceback leads there. Additionally, we need to understand how numpy's `searchsorted` function is interfacing with `LabelEncoder`, particularly with empty arrays and differing data types. \n\nLet's start by locating the `LabelEncoder` class and its `transform` method. We will also look for any code snippets directly related to the error, such as calls to `numpy` 's `searchsorted` within `LabelEncoder`.\n\n1. `search_class(\"LabelEncoder\")` - This should locate the `LabelEncoder` class in the project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"LabelEncoder\")` - This will help us find the `transform` method within the `LabelEncoder` class.\n3. `search_code(\"np.searchsorted\")` - Since the error trace mentioned `np.searchsorted`, we want to find all occurrences of this function to understand its usage context, particularly in relation to `LabelEncoder`.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context for the issue, enabling us to figure out why transforming empty lists results in a type error after fitting `LabelEncoder` with string values."
