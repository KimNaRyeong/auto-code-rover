        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `transform` method should be enhanced to handle empty lists (`y`) gracefully. This involves checking if `y` is empty immediately after its conversion to a columnar format with `column_or_1d(y, warn=True)` and before it gets processed by `np.searchsorted`. If `y` is indeed empty, the method should return an empty array that matches the dtype of `self.classes_` without proceeding to `np.searchsorted`. This ensures that when `transform` is called with an empty list, regardless of the data type of the elements fitted, it consistently returns an empty array with the expected dtype, maintaining the functionality for non-empty inputs while correctly handling empty inputs, thus adhering to the expected behavior described in the issue.\n\nThis adjustment would preempt the type compatibility issue that arises within `np.searchsorted` by ensuring that the scenario leading to the error (transforming an empty list after fitting with non-numeric values) is addressed explicitly, thereby avoiding any unnecessary operations on empty inputs."
