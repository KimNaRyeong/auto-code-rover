This script specifically checks for successful inset axes creation by asserting that the `axins` object has a `plot` attribute, which should be true for a properly instantiated Axes object. In the event of a failure that matches the reported bug, the script is designed to print a detailed stack trace before exiting with a non-zero status code, signaling an error consistent with the reproduction of the reported issue. If the issue is resolved or not present, it prints a success message and exits with code 0.
