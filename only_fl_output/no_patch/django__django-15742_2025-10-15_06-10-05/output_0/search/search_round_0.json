Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we must gather information about the components involved in processing the `blocktranslate` tag with the `asvar` argument. This involves looking into the Django template engine, specifically how it handles translation blocks and variable escaping. Based on the description, the relevant areas to investigate include:\n\n1. The implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag.\n2. The way Django templates handle variable escaping, especially in conjunction with `asvar`.\n3. How `SafeString` instances are treated differently from normal `str` instances during template rendering.\n\nGiven these areas, we can draft a series of API calls to acquire the necessary context.\n\n1. **Search for the implementation of `blocktranslate`:** Since `blocktranslate` is a template tag, it's likely defined within Django's templating engine, possibly in a file related to i18n (internationalization) or translation. However, without the specific file name, we'll start with a search in the entire codebase.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"BlockTranslateNode\")\n    search_method(\"blocktranslate\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Searching for variable escaping and `SafeString` handling:** Django templates automatically escape variables to prevent XSS attacks, but `SafeString` instances are an exception. It's crucial to understand how Django makes this distinction and how `asvar` interacts with this mechanism.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Template\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"render\", \"Template\")\n    search_code(\"SafeString\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Exploring how variables are stored when `asvar` is used:** Understanding the implementation details of how Django stores variables marked with `asvar` in the context can help us grasp why double escaping occurs. This is likely related to the way `blocktranslate` processes and assigns variables.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"resolve_variable\")\n    search_code(\"{% blocktranslate asvar\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls focus on gathering insights into the `blocktranslate` implementation, the template rendering process, the handling of safe and unsafe strings, and the specifics of variable assignment and escaping in Django templates. This information will be crucial for designing a patch to prevent double escaping when using the `asvar` argument with `blocktranslate`."
