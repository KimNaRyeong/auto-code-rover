        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue, we need detailed context about the `Float` class constructor, how precision is handled currently, and where the conversion from decimal to binary precision is implemented. Let's break down the steps required to gather this context:\n\n1. Find the file and location of the `Float` class definition to understand its current constructor and attributes, especially the handling of `prec` attribute.\n2. Find the implementation of the constructor to see how `prec` is being converted to binary precision.\n3. Check if there's an explicit method or code snippet that deals with this conversion from decimal precision to binary precision.\n4. Since the issue mentions that in other parts of `Sympy` and `mpmath`, `prec` refers to binary precision, it might be useful to look at how `prec` is handled or defined in other classes or methods for comparison.\n\nBased on these steps, we'll need to use the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Float\")`: To find the location and details of the `Float` class definition.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Float\")`: To directly find the constructor of the `Float` class and its implementation details.\n- `search_code(\"prec\"): To get instances where `prec` is mentioned or handled, to understand its usage across the project, which could give clues on handling binary vs decimal precision.\n\nThese calls should give us a good starting point to understand how to address the issue described."
