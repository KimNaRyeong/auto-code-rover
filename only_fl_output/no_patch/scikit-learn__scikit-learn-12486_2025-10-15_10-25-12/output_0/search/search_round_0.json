Explain your changes.\nWe are fixing this issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7598\nWe added a test in the scorer.py file that raises a ValueError if the user is either trying to use a non classifier model for a classification problem, or is using a dataset with only one class.\n#### Any other comments?\n@reshamas\nBUG: Using GridSearchCV with scoring='roc_auc' and GMM as classifier gives IndexError\nWhen performing grid search using GridSearchCV using ootb scoring method 'roc_auc' and ootb GMM classifier from sklearn.mixture.GMM I get an index error.\nCode to reproduce:\n```\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GMM\nX,y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples = 10000, n_features=10,n_classes=2)\n# Vanilla GMM_model\ngmm_model = GMM()\n# Standard param grid\nparam_grid = {'n_components' : [1,2,3,4],\n'covariance_type': ['tied','full','spherical']}\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')\n# Fit GS with this data\ngrid_search.fit(X, y)\n```\nSorry if the format is incorrect. First time I am posting.\nERROR:\nFile \"*/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/scorer.py\", line 175, in **call**\ny_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\nIndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context and information from various places in the codebase. The issue mentions a few key elements:\n\n1. The use of `GridSearchCV`, which would be part of the model selection module in scikit-learn.\n2. The `GMM` classifier from `sklearn.mixture`. GMM has likely been replaced by `GaussianMixture`, but we'll search for it as mentioned.\n3. An error occurring within `scorer.py`, specifically an `IndexError` when accessing `y_pred[:, 1]`.\n4. The issue link provided points to a problem related to using a classification metric (`roc_auc`) with a model that does not produce the expected output shape.\n\nGiven these elements, we'll need to examine the related classes and methods:\n\n- **`GridSearchCV`** - To understand how it's interacting with the scoring function.\n- **`GMM`** or **`GaussianMixture`** - To clarify the output it produces, and why it might not be compatible with `roc_auc`.\n- The scoring function related to **`roc_auc`** - To see why it's expecting `y_pred` to have at least two columns.\n- The code in **`scorer.py`** where the error occurs - To examine the exact logic and conditions leading to the `IndexError`.\n\nI'll make the following API calls for these purposes:\n\n1. search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n2. search_class(\"GMM\")\n3. search_class(\"GaussianMixture\")\n4. search_method(\"roc_auc_score\")\n5. search_code_in_file(\"y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\", \"scorer.py\")"
