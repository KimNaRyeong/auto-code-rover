This script aims to reproduce the issue described using Python 3 and exits with code 0 only when the issue is resolved.

It ensures that any caught `IndexError` during `grid_search.fit(X, y)` execution is accurately reported, providing clarity on the nature of the error with a stack trace. This approach facilitates understanding and diagnosing the problem within the given context, making the script a valuable tool for detecting and responding to the described issue."
