To create a script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the reported issue, follow the code block below. This script specifically targets the described scenario and includes functionality to assert the presence of the problem through an `IndexError`. Additionally, it applies the recommended function to print the stack trace for clearer error identification. Upon the resolution of the issue, this script should exit with code 0 without any exceptions raised.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
    X, y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)
    gmm_model = GaussianMixture()

    param_grid = {'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']}
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')

    try:
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The reported IndexError issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_issue()
```

Ensure you modify the following parts if necessary before execution:
- Replace `from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV` with `from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV` since `grid_search` was deprecated and moved to `model_selection`.
- Use `GaussianMixture` instead of the deprecated `GMM` as this reflects the modern API of `sklearn.mixture`.

This script checks for the specific `IndexError` as described, providing a comprehensive stack trace if the error is caught. Resolving the core issue will stop the `AssertionError` from being triggered, allowing the script to exit gracefully with code 0.
