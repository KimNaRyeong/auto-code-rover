This could entail creating a method to manage the determination and application of `dtypes` to the output DataFrame, invoked when the output configuration demands dtype preservation. The method should work seamlessly with the existing `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function to ensure that dtypes are preserved according to the original DataFrame, when applicable."

This parameter would contain the data types of the original input DataFrame that need to be preserved in the output. The function should apply these `dtypes` to the output DataFrame while ensuring that any data type conversion errors are handled gracefully (e.g., by providing warnings and falling back to default dtype conversions). This ensures dtype preservation without impacting the robustness of data transformations."

This includes passing the original input dtypes to `_wrap_in_pandas_container` when the configuration specifies dtype preservation. Changes here should ensure that this enhancement integrates smoothly with the existing configurations and settings, maintaining backward compatibility while adding the new functionality."
