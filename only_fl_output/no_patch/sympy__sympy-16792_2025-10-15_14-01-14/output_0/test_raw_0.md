Here's a standalone `reproducer.py` script designed to execute as per your instructions. This script will run the problematic scenario described, attempt to catch the `TypeError` gracefully, and if caught, print a detailed stack trace. It will exit with status code 0 if the issue is fixed, otherwise, it will raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_autowrap_cython_backend_with_unused_array_args():
    from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    import numpy as np
    
    x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
    expr = 1.0
    try:
        f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')
        result = f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
        assert result == 1.0, "Result is not as expected."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Autowrap with cython backend failed due to an unhandled exception.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_autowrap_cython_backend_with_unused_array_args()
```

This script:

1. Defines a function to print a stack trace upon catching an exception.
2. Defines a test function which sets up and runs the example code demonstrating the issue with autowrap and the Cython backend. This is precisely the scenario where an array argument is provided but not used in the expression that's being auto-wrapped.
3. Catches any errors that happen during the function execution, prints their stack trace, and raises an `AssertionError` to indicate the problem persists.
4. If the issue is fixed (i.e., the script does not run into any catch block), the script will complete successfully showing that the assumed fix is working as intended.

Running `python3 reproducer.py` will execute this test. If the issue is still there, it will print a detailed error message and exit unsuccessfully.
