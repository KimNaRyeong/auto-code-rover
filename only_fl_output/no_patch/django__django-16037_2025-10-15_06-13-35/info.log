The intended behavior is to ensure that any subquery used within an annotation or any similar queryset transformation strictly returns only the necessary columns - typically one for aggregation purposes. This might involve reviewing the annotation logic to ensure it's correctly tailored to produce a valid SQL statement that is compatible with both SQLite and PostgreSQL, ensuring the aggregation properly captures the count of `liked_by` without causing structural issues in the generated subquery."
