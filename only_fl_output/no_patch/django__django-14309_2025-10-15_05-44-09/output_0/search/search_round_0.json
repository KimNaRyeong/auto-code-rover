Therefore, I will call the following APIs with specific arguments to get relevant information:\n\n- search_class(\"Q\"): To get information on the `Q` class, which is crucial for understanding how query objects are combined and negated.\n- search_class(\"Exists\"): To gather details on the `Exists` class to see how it's implemented and how it interacts with other query objects like `Q`.\n- search_method(\"combine\"): Since the issue mentions combining `Q` and `Exists`, it's important to understand the implementation of the combine method that might be used for this operation.\n- search_code(\"def combine(self, other, connector, negate)\"): This search will help find the exact implementation of the combine method, which is crucial for understanding how negation is applied or misapplied in this context.\n- search_method_in_class(\"__and__\", \"Q\"): To understand how the `&` operator is implemented for `Q` objects as it's directly related to the issue reported.\n\nThese API calls will help gather sufficient code context to begin resolving the issue."
