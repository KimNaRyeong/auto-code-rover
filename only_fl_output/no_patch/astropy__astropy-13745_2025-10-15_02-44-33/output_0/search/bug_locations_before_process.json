        "intended_behavior": "The `_validate_angles` method should incorporate a tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies when validating latitude angles, especially near the extreme values of -90 and +90 degrees. This involves adjusting the comparison operations to allow angles that are within a very small epsilon of -\u03c0/2 to \u03c0/2 radians (or -90 to +90 degrees) to be considered valid. This tolerance should respect the precision of the data type of the angle being validated (e.g., float32), ensuring functionality that accommodates practical precision limits while preserving the existing functionality for more precise data types like float64. This can be done by determining an acceptable epsilon value for different data types or by introducing a more dynamic validation logic that accounts for the type and precision of the input angle value. The calculation of `limit` may need to be adjusted to include this epsilon, or an additional comparison step may need to be incorporated that checks if the angle is within epsilon of the limit. This precision-aware approach will ensure that valid latitude values, such as the float32 representation of \u03c0/2, are not incorrectly flagged as invalid due to minor precision discrepancies."
