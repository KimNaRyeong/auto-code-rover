This script will try to recreate the aforementioned issue where a `ValueError` is raised when attempting to create a `Latitude` object with a `float32` representation that is very close to but slightly exceeds Ï€/2 due to floating-point precision limits. The `AssertionError` will indicate that the issue is present, and the stack trace will be printed for detailed debugging information. When the issue is resolved, it's expected that the script completes successfully and exits with code 0, printing a success message.
