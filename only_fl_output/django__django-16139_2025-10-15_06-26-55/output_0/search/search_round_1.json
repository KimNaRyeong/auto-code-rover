If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results gives us a clearer view of the part of the code associated with the issue.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `UserChangeForm` class in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` is designed for handling user data changes in the Django admin. A notable feature of this form is the `password` field, which uses a `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`. The `__init__` method of this class modifies the help text of the `password` field to include a link to a form where the password can be changed. This is accomplished by formatting the `help_text` of the `password` field with a relative URL to the password change form.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue arises because the formatting of the `help_text` for the `password` field uses a static relative path `(\"../password/\")`. In instances where `UserAdmin` is accessed not by its primary key (pk) but by another field specified by `to_field` (for example, `uuid`), this relative path becomes incorrect, leading to a 404 error when attempting to access the password change form. This is the core of the bug reported in the issue.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the `help_text` of the `password` field to dynamically generate the correct relative URL to the password change form, taking into account how the `UserAdmin` is being accessed. This means creating the URL based on the actual way the user object is being referenced (e.g., its `pk` or any field specified by `to_field`), ensuring the link to the password change form works correctly in all cases. The provided solution involves formatting the `help_text` with a URL that includes the instance's primary key (pk), ensuring the link remains valid regardless of how the `UserAdmin` page is accessed.\n\nThe next steps should involve modifying the code in such a way that it constructs the URL dynamically, correctly pointing to the password reset form relative to the user's unique identifier within the URL path, addressing the bug described."

The dynamic link should account for the case when `UserAdmin` is accessed by a field specified by `to_field`. Instead of using a relative path that assumes the user is accessed by its primary key, the path should dynamically include the user's primary key or the relevant identifier specified by `to_field`. This ensures that the link to the password change form remains valid and does not lead to a 404 error.\n\n   To achieve this, the code:\n   ```python\n   password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n   ```\n   should be replaced with a dynamic path construction that utilizes the instance's PK or the relevant identifying field, such as:\n   ```python\n   password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\n   ```\n   This change will dynamically construct the URL based on the instance's primary key, thus resolving the issue described and preserving the existing functionality of allowing users to navigate to the password change form from the help text link."
