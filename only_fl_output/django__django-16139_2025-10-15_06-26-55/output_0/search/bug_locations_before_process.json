        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of `UserChangeForm` should be updated to ensure that the help text for the `password` field generates a dynamic link that correctly points to the password change form, regardless of how the `UserAdmin` is accessed. The dynamic link should account for the case when `UserAdmin` is accessed by a field specified by `to_field`. Instead of using a relative path that assumes the user is accessed by its primary key, the path should dynamically include the user's primary key or the relevant identifier specified by `to_field`. This ensures that the link to the password change form remains valid and does not lead to a 404 error."
