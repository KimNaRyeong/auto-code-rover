        "intended_behavior": "The `_deprecate_ci` function should be modified to include logic for handling the case when `ci=None`. Specifically, when `ci=None` is encountered, the function should issue a user warning informing them of the deprecation of the `ci` parameter in favor of directly using `errorbar=None` for equivalent functionality. This ensures that users intending to disable confidence intervals in their plots are correctly guided towards the new parameter usage without altering the function's handling of other `ci` values. This change should preserve the existing functionality for all other cases where `ci` is not `None`, ensuring that the transition to `errorbar` does not disrupt existing codebases relying on seaborn's `lineplot`."
