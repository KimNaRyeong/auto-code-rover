This script will try to print the string representation of `DateField.input_formats` from the Django forms. If it fails to do so due to the issue described, it will print the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exit with an `AssertionError`. If the issue is fixed, it'll print a confirmation message and exit with code 0, indicating that the problem is no longer present.
