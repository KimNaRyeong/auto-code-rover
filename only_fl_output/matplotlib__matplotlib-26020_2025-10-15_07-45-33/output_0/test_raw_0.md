This script aims at identifying the presence of the bug as described in the issue report: when attempting to create an `AxesGrid` using `GeoAxes` from `cartopy` as the `axes_class`, it should raise a `TypeError` with the message `'method' object is not subscriptable`. This error replicates the reported issue where `AxesGrid` fails to interpolate with a non-default `axes_class`, particularly with `GeoAxes`.

The script should be saved as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the intended project. When executed, it will either:
- Print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` if the bug is present.
- Exit with code 0 (indicating successful completion without errors or the absence of the reported issue) if the bug cannot be reproduced, meaning either the environment is unaffected by this issue or the issue has been fixed in the tested version of the involved libraries.
