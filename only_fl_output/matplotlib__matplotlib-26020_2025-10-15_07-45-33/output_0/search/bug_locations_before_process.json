        "intended_behavior": "The `_tick_only` method should be modified to determine whether the `axis` attribute of the provided `ax` object is a method (indicative of a `GeoAxes` instance) or a subscriptable object (standard matplotlib axes). This can be achieved by implementing an `if` condition to check if `ax.axis` is callable. If true (indicating a `GeoAxes` object or similar), the method should employ an alternate approach to toggle ticklabels and labels that does not involve subscripting. If false, the method can proceed as it currently does for standard axes.\n\nThis modification ensures that the functionality to toggle visibility of tick labels and labels remains operational across all types of axes objects supported by matplotlib and its extensions. The solution must ensure that no existing functionality is broken for standard axes while extending support for `GeoAxes` by handling them appropriately according to their nature."
