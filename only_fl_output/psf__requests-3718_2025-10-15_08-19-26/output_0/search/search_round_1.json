Understanding how `InvalidLinkBear` is implemented and what it does in the `run` method is crucial.\n2. **The `get_status_code` method in `InvalidLinkBear`**: This method directly relates to the operation causing the error, as it's responsible for network requests that seem to result in the object's `raw` attribute being `None`.\n3. **The use of `requests` library in `InvalidLinkBear.get_status_code`**: Since the issue appears after upgrading `requests`, understanding how `requests` is used within `get_status_code` will be necessary. Specifically, seeing how `requests.head` or `requests.get` (if used) is implemented within this context.\n4. **Interaction with `requests_mock`**: The use of `requests_mock` in the stack trace suggests there is stubbing or mocking of web requests, which could be affecting the `raw` response object. Understanding its setup and usage could unveil misuse or outdated practices with the new `requests` version.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather the required context:\n\n- `search_class(\"InvalidLinkBear\")`: To get an overall view of the `InvalidLinkBear` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"run\", \"InvalidLinkBear\")`: To inspect the `run` method of `InvalidLinkBear`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_status_code\", \"InvalidLinkBear\")`: To examine the implementation of `get_status_code` within `InvalidLinkBear`.\n\nThis selection aims at understanding the flow leading to the error, the specific use of `requests` that might be problematic, and any potential misuse of `requests_mock` regarding how the `raw` object is handled."

        "content": "Given that the search for the `InvalidLinkBear` class and methods directly within it returned no results, it's possible that the class or methods might have been renamed, or there's an issue with the search parameters. Alternatively, the `InvalidLinkBear` might be part of a library or a plugin system where its definition is not straightforward. Another possibility is that the code resides in a different repository or a location that the search API does not directly index.\n\nTo navigate around these limitations, we can adjust our strategy by:\n\n1. Expanding the search to methods and code snippets that are mentioned in the stack trace and are likely to exist in the codebase. Specifically, we can look into how the `requests` library is utilized since it's a common library and the error seems related to its usage.\n2. Given the error occurs in `requests.models.py` during a call to `.content`, which in turn tries to read from `self.raw.read`, it would be insightful to know how the `requests` session is initialized and used in the context that leads to this call. This includes examining the customization and handling of responses, especially focusing on streaming or chunked responses, as these features directly interact with `self.raw.read`.\n3. Since `requests_mock` is mentioned, understanding its setup and usage in the tests could provide insights into why `self.raw` could be `None`.\n\nLet's make the following API calls to further our investigation based on the stack trace information and the components involved in the bug:\n\n- `search_code(\"requests.head\")`: Since the `head` method from requests is explicitly mentioned, examining how it's used across the codebase might reveal customizations or usage patterns that lead to `self.raw` being `None`.\n- `search_code(\"requests_mock\")`: This will help us understand how `requests_mock` is configured and used, highlighting potential issues with mock setups that could lead to the observed issue.\n- `search_code(\"self.raw.read\")`: Although it's less likely to find direct references to this internal `requests` operation, there could be relevant handling or checks around `self.raw` that are custom to the coala project, especially in the context of error handling or response processing.\n\nThese adjusted calls aim to uncover how `requests` and `requests_mock` are integrated and used within the project, providing clues on the interaction that leads to `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "2. Without direct access to the specific source code and based on the given stack trace and error description, we can infer the following potential bug location and propose an intended behavior to resolve the issue:\n\n### Bug Location:\n- **File**: `bears/general/InvalidLinkBear.py`\n- **Class**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests the issue is within the implementation related to handling HTTP requests, possibly in a method that deals with fetching HTTP headers or content. The direct method implicated is `get_status_code`.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\nThe issue arises from a `NoneType` object, which suggests that `self.raw` is `None` at the time `.read` is called. The intended behavior is to ensure `self.raw` is not `None` before attempting to read from it. This can be a part of error-handling logic around network requests where the response object is thoroughly checked before accessing its contents. Specifically:\n- Implement or enhance checks around the response object to ensure `self.raw` is available and not `None` before proceeding with any operation that assumes its presence.\n- In the case where `self.raw` could be `None` (e.g., mocked responses, errors in fetching, or unexpected response types), the code should gracefully handle these scenarios, possibly by logging an error or returning a default error code indicating the failure to obtain a valid HTTP response.\n- Additionally, review the usage of `requests_mock` or any other mocking/stubbing mechanism to ensure it's correctly simulating network responses, including setting the `raw` attribute when needed.\n\nAnother aspect to consider could be the upgrade of the `requests` library and its compatibility with `requests_mock` or how the project uses the library's interfaces, which might have changed between versions. The intended behavior here would include ensuring compatibility with newer versions of `requests` or adjusting usage patterns to match the expected behavior of the updated library.\n\nDue to the limitations in directly pinpointing the method within `InvalidLinkBear.py` without precise search results, the described intended behavior provides a generic strategy to address the identified issue based on the nature of the error and the surrounding context of its occurrence."
