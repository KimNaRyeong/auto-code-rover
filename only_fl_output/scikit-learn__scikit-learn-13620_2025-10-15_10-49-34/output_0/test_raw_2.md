Understood, let's rewrite the `reproducer.py` file with an explicit check for the issue and ensuring it appropriately raises an `AssertionError` when the feature importance sum does not equal 1. Additionally, it will exit with code 0 when no issue is detected or after showcasing the issue precisely.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_feature_importance_sum(clf, expected_sum=1.0):
    feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
    if not np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, expected_sum, atol=1e-6):
        raise AssertionError(f"Feature importance sum {feature_importance_sum} != expected sum {expected_sum}")

try:
    # Load the Boston housing dataset
    boston = datasets.load_boston()
    X, Y = boston.data, boston.target

    # Define the Gradient Boosting model
    params = {'n_estimators': 720, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    # Check the overall feature importance
    check_feature_importance_sum(clf)

    # If no issue is found
    print("No issue detected with feature importances. They correctly sum to 1.")
    sys.exit(0)

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
    
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script executes the same steps as proposed, but it includes a dedicated check function `check_feature_importance_sum` to assess if there's an issue with the feature importance sum not equaling 1. The script attempts to capture any issues accurately, including unexpected exceptions, which could highlight potential underlying problems not directly related to the primary issue being checked. Place this file in the root directory of your project and execute it with Python 3 to test for the reported issue.
