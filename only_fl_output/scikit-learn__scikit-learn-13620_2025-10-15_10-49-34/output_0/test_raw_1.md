Based on your request to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that aims to address the specific issue involving feature importances in gradient boosting not summing to 1, I've revised the script to ensure it performs the necessary checks and handles any issues by printing a stack trace. This version of the script will also attempt a graceful exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved or not present, following your specifications:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    # Prepare the data
    boston = datasets.load_boston()
    X, Y = boston.data, boston.target

    params = {
        'n_estimators': 720,
        'max_depth': 6,
        'learning_rate': 0.1,
    }
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    overall_feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
    print(f"Overall feature importance sum = {overall_feature_importance_sum}")

    # Assertion to check if overall feature importance sums to 1
    try:
        assert np.isclose(overall_feature_importance_sum, 1.0), "Overall feature importance sum does not equal 1."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Verify each tree's feature importance
    for i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):
        feature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)
        try:
            assert np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, 1.0), f"At n_estimators = {i}, feature importance sum = {feature_importance_sum}"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print(f"Failed at n_estimators = {i}")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            break  # Break on first error to avoid flooding the output

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        print("No issue found. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script includes a comprehensive check for the described issue by:
- Fitting a `GradientBoostingRegressor` to the Boston housing dataset.
- Checking the aggregated feature importances sum to verify if it equals 1.
- If the check fails, an `AssertionError` is raised, and a stack trace is printed.
- Additionally, it iterates through each tree's feature importance sum, ensuring each one individually sums to 1, to tackle the issue thoroughly from both an overall and a granular perspective.
- Appropriate exception handling is implemented to capture and print stack trace information for any assertion or unexpected exception, adhering to the provided method format for clarity and debugging purposes.

This script is intended to be placed in the root directory of the project and should be run with Python 3 to ensure compatibility and proper functioning, especially considering potential issues related to the Python or library versions.
