        "intended_behavior": "In the `__new__` method of the `Idx` class, there should be an enhancement in the validation logic to check both elements of a tuple (if a tuple is provided) to ensure they are integer expressions. This validation should occur before creating a new instance of `Idx`. If either the lower or upper bound in the tuple is not an integer expression, the method should raise a `TypeError` indicating that `Idx` object bounds must be integers. This change will prevent the acceptance of non-integer bounds for the `Idx` object and will ensure consistency with the error handling mechanism already inplace for a single non-integer bound case."
