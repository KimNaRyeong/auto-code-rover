        "content": "<issue>Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

Based on the conditions, it assigns the `self._figure` attribute to different targets depending on whether the target is a `matplotlib.figure.Figure`, a `matplotlib.figure.SubFigure`, or something else. The critical lines for the issue are:\n\n- Line 179 initially sets `self._figure` to `target.figure` if the target has a `.figure` attribute (probably intended for typical matplotlib Axes objects).\n- Lines 183-186 checks if the `target` is an instance of `mpl.figure.SubFigure`, a feature added in matplotlib 3.4, and then assigns `figure = target.figure`.\n- Line 195 updates `self._figure` with the figure determined by the preceding conditions.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug report mentions that when plotting using the seaborn objects API on subfigures, the figure title gets removed. The issue was temporarily resolved by modifying line 186 from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target`. The code snippet shows that when dealing with subfigures, the original implementation tries to associate the `Subplots` object's figure attribute (`self._figure`) not with the `SubFigure` instance directly but with its parent figure. This reassignment likely disrupts the proper handling of titles in subfigure contexts, possibly because the title is set on the subfigure level, not the main figure level, but the seaborn plot association redirects focus away from the subfigure to the main figure.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be for seaborn's objects API to correctly handle plotting on subfigures without interfering with figure-wide properties such as titles. This means the `Subplots.init_figure` method should correctly distinguish between when to associate plots with the entire figure vs. when to work directly with subfigures, ensuring that operations on subfigures (like adding a title) are maintained irrespective of seaborn plotting functions.\n\nThe correction suggested by the issue reporter involves changing the handling so that when detecting a `SubFigure` instance, the seaborn plot associates itself directly with this `SubFigure` without redirecting to the parent figure \u2014 preserving any figure-level attributes or modifications specific to the subfigure.\n\nGiven this analysis, further actions could include examining how the `figure` attribute is utilized throughout the seaborn objects API, especially in rendering plots, to ensure that changing this assignment doesn't introduce other undesired behaviors. Additional context might be required to cover how titles are managed or how plots are drawn on `SubFigure` instances to validate the suggested fix's impact comprehensively."

This change ensures that operations and attributes specific to a subfigure, such as setting a title, are preserved and not overridden or lost when seaborn plots are drawn on these subfigures. The line `figure = target.figure` should be adjusted to `figure = target` when the target is a `SubFigure` instance. This modification will allow seaborn's object API to maintain the expected behavior of subfigures, including keeping the figure title intact when plotting. This adjustment should be made with consideration to preserve all existing functionality where the target is not a `SubFigure`, ensuring that the fix does not inadvertently affect other use cases."
