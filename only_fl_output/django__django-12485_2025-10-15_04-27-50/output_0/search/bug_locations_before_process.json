        "intended_behavior": "During the parsing of multipart/form-data request bodies, especially when parsing the content-disposition header for filenames (`filename` and `filename*` attributes), ensure that filenames enclosed in double quotes are correctly processed. This means trimming the leading and trailing double quotes from the filename before it's used or stored, maintaining existing functionality for correctly formatted filenames but adding resilience against filenames provided with extra double quotes. This enhancement would include checking if a filename parsed from the content-disposition header begins and ends with double quotes and, if so, removing these quotes. Special consideration should be given to escaped quotes within the filename itself, ensuring they are not incorrectly trimmed or altered. The goal is to accurately handle filenames as they're typically provided by user agents or tools like PostmanCanary, which might include extra double-quote characters wrapping the filename, ensuring these characters do not end up as part of the filename stored or returned by Django."

        "method": "parse_header",
        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the `parse_header` function to ensure that when parsing headers, especially focusing on filename extraction from the content-disposition, it robustly handles and removes enclosing double quotes around values, including filenames, without altering the rest of the existing parsing logic. Specifically, after splitting and decoding the value as per the current functionality, implement an additional check to strip leading and trailing double quotes from the extracted filename value. This improvement should be careful to preserve any internal double quotes or special characters that are part of the filename itself, ensuring only extraneous quotes wrapping the entire value are affected. The approach will align Django's filename handling in multipart/form-data parsing more closely with practices seen in other tools and languages, improving interoperability and reducing issues related to unexpected filename formatting."
