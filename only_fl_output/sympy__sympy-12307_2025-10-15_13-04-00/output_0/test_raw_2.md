Based on the task and previous feedback, I'll adjust the approach to ensure the `AssertionError` is accurately triggered when the Fortran code for the `sign` function does not match the expected correct format. 

This involves adding another condition to the assertion to ensure that a failure is reported not only when `sign(x)` is encountered (which is incorrect Fortran syntax for the `sign` function) but also making sure the script exits with code 0 only when the issue has truly been fixed (i.e., when the generated code matches expected correct Fortran syntax), which was an oversight in the previous instructions.

Here's an updated `reproducer.py` Python script that addresses these points:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sign_function_codegen():
    import sympy as sp
    from sympy.abc import x
    # Generate Fortran code for the sign function
    generated_code = sp.fcode(sp.sign(x)).strip()
    # Verify if the generated code matches expected Fortran syntax for the sign function
    valid_fortran_syntax = generated_code.startswith('sign(1,') or generated_code.startswith('sign(1d0,')
    if not valid_fortran_syntax:
        raise AssertionError(f"Generated Fortran code for sign function is incorrect: {generated_code}")

def main():
    try:
        test_sign_function_codegen()
        print("The issue appears to be fixed or not present.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with 0 to denote the issue is present as per instructions
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised script better aligns with the guidelines provided by checking explicitly for an expected valid Fortran syntax and handling the exit code based on whether an issue is detected.
