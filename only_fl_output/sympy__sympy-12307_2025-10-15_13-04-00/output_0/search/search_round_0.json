        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to the Fortran code generation for the sign function by Sympy, we need to focus on investigating how the Fortran code generation is implemented in Sympy, especially concerning the `sign` function. The relevant components would likely involve the `fcode` function which is used to generate Fortran code, and possibly any classes or methods related to code generation rules for mathematical functions.\n\nGiven the provided information, the following API calls can provide the needed context:\n\n1. Search for where the `fcode` function is implemented or referenced within the Sympy codebase. This will give us an insight into how `fcode` handles different cases, including the `sign` function.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"fcode\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions that it relates to the `sign` function's handling, finding where in the codebase the `sign` function is specifically dealt with during Fortran code generation would be critical.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"sign(x)\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help us identify the parts of the code that need to be modified to correctly generate Fortran code for the `sign` function, adhering to the syntax expected by Fortran compilers as highlighted in the issue description."
