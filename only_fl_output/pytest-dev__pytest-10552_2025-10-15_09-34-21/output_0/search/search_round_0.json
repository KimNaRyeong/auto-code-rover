Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nclass TestFoo:\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod() -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod_inner(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_staticmethod_outer(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod(cls) -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod_inner(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_classmethod_outer(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n```\nThe most worrysome cases are `test_classmethod` and `test_classmethod_outer`, which are not discovered by pytest.

        "content": "To address the issue related to inconsistent support for `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in pytest discovery and execution, especially with parametrization, we need to collect more information about how these methods are structured and used in the codebase, as well as how pytest configuration or custom pytest hooks might be interacting with them.\n\nBased on the code snippets provided in the issue, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the `TestFoo` class to understand if there are any specific configurations or fixtures applied at the class level that might influence the test discovery and execution process.\n   - `search_class(\"TestFoo\")`\n\n2. Since the use of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` with or without the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator behaves inconsistently according to the issue, it\u2019s essential to locate other occurrences of such patterns to see if they differ in any way or if there's a common factor causing the issue.\n   - `search_method(\"@staticmethod\\ndef test_\")`\n   - `search_method(\"@classmethod\\ndef test_\")`\n\n3. The issue description hints at how decorators\u2019 ordering (`@staticmethod`/`@classmethod` with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`) affects pytest's ability to run these tests. Finding more examples of these usage patterns might shed light on best practices or common pitfalls within the current project.\n   - `search_code(\"@staticmethod\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize\")`\n   - `search_code(\"@classmethod\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize\")`\n   - `search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\\n@staticmethod\")`\n   - `search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\\n@classmethod\")`\n\nThese calls aim to gather a comprehensive view of how class-based tests and parameterized tests are structured across the project, identifying if the issue described is isolated or part of a broader pattern necessitating a consistent approach to address it."
