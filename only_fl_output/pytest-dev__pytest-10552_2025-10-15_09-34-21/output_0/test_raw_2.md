To directly target the issue described with `pytest`, this revised script aims to create test scenarios programmatically and attempts to run `pytest` directly from within the script, checking if those `classmethod` and `staticmethod` tests are properly discovered and executed. Since the core issue involves `pytest`'s behavior with collecting and running these methods, particularly when combined with parameterization or missing it, we'll have to invoke `pytest` programmatically and analyze its output or results to determine whether the issue persists.

Please note, this approach genuinely attempts to interact with `pytest`, relying on `pytest`'s APIs and output parsing to check if the tests have been collected and executed as expected. The script will dynamically create a test file with `staticmethod` and `classmethod` cases and then run `pytest` on this file, checking the outcomes based on `pytest`'s results.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    with open('test_reproducer.py', 'w') as test_file:
        test_file.write(file_contents)

        result = subprocess.run(['pytest', 'test_reproducer.py', '-v'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        if result.returncode != 0 and ("collected 0 items" in result.stdout or "collected 0 items" in result.stderr):
            raise AssertionError("No tests were collected, indicating potential issue with staticmethod/classmethod handling")

This script dynamically writes the test cases including `staticmethod` and `classmethod` into a temporary test file and tries to run `pytest` against it, aiming to closely reproduce the described issue. It interprets `pytest`'s output to determine whether the tests are correctly collected and executed, providing a more accurate reproduction of the issue you highlighted.
