When such arguments are passed, call_command should correctly parse and use them without causing errors related to required arguments or incorrect parsing. This might involve adjusting how call_command builds its internal representation of command arguments or how it deals with argument defaults and mutually exclusive groups. The solution should ensure that mutually exclusive arguments can be programmatically specified in a way that matches their command-line usage, ensuring that the process respects the original intention of such arguments being mutually exclusive."

        "intended_behavior": "Potentially within custom command classes (e.g., the user-provided 'Command' class where 'add_arguments' is defined), there could be a requirement to redefine or adjust how arguments are added or how mutually exclusive arguments are handled within these classes. However, based on the provided information and results, the primary issue seems to stem from how 'call_command' handles these arguments rather than how they are defined in command classes. Therefore, unless further analysis suggests issues with specific implementations of 'add_arguments' in custom command classes, the focus is on adjusting 'call_command' to accommodate the described use case."
