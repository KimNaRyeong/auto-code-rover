        "intended_behavior": "The `is_ajax` method should be marked as deprecated to notify developers of its pending removal in future releases. This involves:\n\n- Adding a deprecation warning that aligns with Django's deprecation policy. This warning should inform developers when the method will be removed and suggest alternatives for achieving the desired functionality, such as inspecting the `Accept` header directly or using other modern JavaScript techniques that are not dependent on the `X-Requested-With` header.\n- Preserving the existing functionality of the `is_ajax` method until its eventual removal. This ensures that developers have time to transition their codebase away from using `is_ajax` without immediate disruption.\n- In the deprecation warning, guiding developers on more standard-compliant ways to determine if a request is made with Ajax, possibly by example or reference to the Django documentation that highlights using the `Accept` header or other modern JavaScript APIs like `fetch()`, which do not inherently set the `X-Requested-With` header.\n\nThis strategy ensures a smooth transition away from the deprecated method by providing clear guidance and maintaining backward compatibility until the method is removed."
