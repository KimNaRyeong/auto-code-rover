Based on the information given in the issue, we should consider the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `UploadFileForm` class**: This class is directly involved in processing the file upload. Understanding its definition might provide insights into how file names and extensions are processed.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"UploadFileForm\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the `index` view method**: The `index` function is where the error occurs during the file upload process when the uploaded file name contains null bytes. Analyzing its code could help in identifying the exact point where the exception is raised, and where validation or sanitization could be applied.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"index\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for code related to `request.FILES` handling**: Since the `request.FILES` dict-like object is used to access uploaded files, looking into how it's handled could reveal potential places to implement a check for null bytes in filenames.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"request.FILES\")\n```\n\nThese API calls will provide a solid foundation by gathering the necessary code context to develop a strategy for resolving the issue related to file uploads where the filename contains null characters."
