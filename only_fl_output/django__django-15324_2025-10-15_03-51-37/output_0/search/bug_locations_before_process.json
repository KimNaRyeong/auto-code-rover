This could be implemented as a method override in FileField or in any method responsible for handling the file name before it's used to create temporary files. The validation should throw a clear validation error if a null byte is detected, preventing the upload process from proceeding to the point where a temporary file is attempted to be created with a null byte in its name."

This utility function should be called wherever file names are handled or stored, especially before creating temporary files, ensuring that no part of the system attempts to handle file names that contain null bytes."
