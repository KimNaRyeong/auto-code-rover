        "intended_behavior": "The code within this location, specifically where it calls self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight), is intended to correctly initialize the regressor using the provided initial estimator. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to ensure compatibility with the signature of Pipeline.fit. This means adjusting the calling convention to pass sample_weight as a named argument within **fit_params if self.init_ is indeed a pipeline (or supports **fit_params). This change would allow users to use a Pipeline as the initial estimator without encountering a TypeError. The modified implementation should check if self.init_ can accept sample_weight directly or as part of **fit_params and then adapt the call accordingly. This ensures that the functionality is preserved when using custom estimators as the initial model while adding support for Pipeline objects. The check could involve inspecting the fit method signature of self.init_ or safely attempting to pass sample_weight and adjusting based on the outcome. This solution seeks to maintain existing functionalities for all current users of GradientBoostingRegressor while extending its flexibility to allow Pipeline objects as initial estimators, thus solving the reported issue without breaking compatibility with other parts of the scikit-learn framework."
