        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that when a figure is saved with 'bbox_inches=\"tight\"' and using a layout set through 'subplot_mosaic' with 'layout='compressed'', the layout settings are preserved accurately across multiple save operations. This entails maintaining the figure's layout and compression settings in the figure's state, such that repeated saves do not alter the layout appearance. This requires potentially caching or reaffirming the layout configuration just before the save operation if 'bbox_inches=\"tight\"' is used, ensuring the layout compression is applied equally across all save operations."

        "intended_behavior": "The 'subplot_mosaic' method implementation must ensure that once a compressed layout is set up for a figure, these settings are embedded into the figure's metadata or state in a manner that they are referred to or reapplied in subsequent operations affecting the figure's layout, including saving with 'bbox_inches=\"tight\"'. This means enhancing how layout settings are stored or referenced within a figure's lifecycle, ensuring consistency between the visualization on-screen and the saved files."
