This script will attempt to reproduce the specific failure in the `sympy` test suite mentioned in your scenario. The conducted approach sets the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable first, making sure that the hash randomization is consistent with the initial reproduction steps. It then runs a specific part (4/4) of the Sympy test suite with a specific seed to attempt and reproduce the issue at hand.

By catching `AssertionError` specifically during the execution of the original test function, it uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print a detailed trace of the error which should preserve line numbers and code context as requested. The script exits with status code 1 upon encountering the specific issue and 0 otherwise, allowing for easy integration into automated testing or CI environments.
