Given the specific requirements for reproducing the issue described and ensuring the standalone script functions properly within the constraints you've identified, let's revise the script accordingly. The previous script may have ventured off-course by attempting to indirectly trigger the specific test within the entire suite, possibly leading to the observed timeout. This time, we'll directly address the issue from the provided details, focusing on invoking the necessary parts of the test that led to the `AssertionError` in a more streamlined and direct manner.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue_reproducer():
    import os
    import sympy

    # Setting the environment variable as specified to control hash seed behavior
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'

    # Directly reproducing the logic that caused the failure based on the provided traceback
    try:
        from sympy import symbols
        from sympy.simplify.cse_opts import cse

        x0, x1, x2 = symbols('x0 x1 x2')
        exprs = [x0 + x1 + x2, x0**2 + x1 + x2**2]
        
        # Perform Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
        replacements, reduced_exprs = cse(exprs)

        # Asserting based on the failed assertion reproducing the issue
        assert not any(i.is_Mul for a in replacements for i in a[1].args), "Issue not fixed"

        print("The issue is not present, test passed without AssertionError.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code indicating the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # General catch for unexpected errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_issue_reproducer()
```

This script narrows down the focus directly to the part of the code that triggers the `AssertionError`, based only on the snippet provided and assuming the issue's presence in a way similar to how the original test case might execute. It uses the environment variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` to follow the instructions for replicating the issue's environment, then it aims to directly replicate the failure by executing a minimal equivalent of the test logic that caused the issue originally.

The script exits with status code 0 only if the problematic assertion does not trigger an `AssertionError`, interpreted as the issue being fixed. If the assertion fails, it catches this specific exception, prints a detailed stack trace using your provided function, and exits with status code 1, indicating the issue's presence.
