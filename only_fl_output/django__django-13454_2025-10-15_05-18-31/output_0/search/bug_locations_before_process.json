Since `GenericForeignKey` does not have direct database columns, the modification should enable `EmptyFieldListFilter` to work with the two underlying fields (`content_type_id` and `object_id`) indirectly referenced by `GenericForeignKey`. The filter should check for the presence or absence of linked objects by considering if both or either of the underlying fields are empty."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not inherently buggy, to facilitate the usage with `EmptyFieldListFilter`, `GenericForeignKey` might need a method or attribute to simulate `empty_strings_allowed` behavior based on its linked fields. This would mean creating a mechanism to allow `EmptyFieldListFilter` to recognize when `GenericForeignKey` is effectively empty or null by evaluating its composed `content_type` and `object_id` fields. This could be a new method or property in `GenericForeignKey` that `EmptyFieldListFilter` can call to determine if the generic relation is empty."
