Based on the instructions and the nature of the issue described, here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that aims to correctly raise an `AssertionError` when the issue of `DatasetGroupBy` objects not implementing the `quantile` function is present. If fixed, the script should acknowledge that no issue was detected.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', line_number, ": ", code_context, file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Create a sample dataset
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # Attempt to access the `quantile` method on a dataset grouped by a condition.
        quantile_attr = getattr(ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0), 'quantile', None)
        
        # Assert that the `quantile` attribute exists, i.e., is not None
        assert quantile_attr is not None, "DatasetGroupBy object does not implement quantile."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # Captures any other unexpected exception
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If everything goes fine, and `quantile` exists, print a success message.
        print("No issue detected. The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script follows a structured exception handling strategy:
- It first creates a sample dataset and attempts to reference the `quantile` method on a `DatasetGroupBy` object.
- If `quantile` is not present, it explicitly raises an `AssertionError` to indicate the issue persists.
- The `print_stacktrace` function neatly formats any exception encountered, maintaining clarity in tracking the source of failure.
- Adequate exit codes (`exit(1)` for failure, `exit(0)` for success) have been used to reflect the outcome of the script execution properly.
