The following API calls are designed to collect the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `DatasetGroupBy` class to understand its current structure and methods:\n   - `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of the `quantile` method in the `DataArrayGroupBy` class, as the issue description suggests it exists for `DataArrayGroupBy` but not for `DatasetGroupBy`. This comparison might help understand what's missing or how it's implemented for `DataArrayGroupBy`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArrayGroupBy\")`\n\n3. Given that implementing the `quantile` method in `DatasetGroupBy` might involve similar logic to its implementation in `DataArrayGroupBy` or other groupby functionalities, we'll also look for any existing `quantile` method implementations in the dataset or data array contexts (not necessarily within a groupby operation):\n   - `search_method(\"quantile\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of how quantile calculations are currently supported in xarray and what might be needed to extend this functionality to grouped datasets."
