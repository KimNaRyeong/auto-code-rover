Given the error message you provided, it seems the initial issue of the script not reproducing the desired behavior could be due to an environment-specific problem, particularly with the sklearn installation. However, focusing strictly on the task as presented, assuming an operational environment where sklearn is correctly installed and operational, the following `reproducer.py` script adheres to your requirements:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    try:
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)  # Fetches dataset
        X, y = census.data, census.target  # Splits into features and target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']  # Defines columns
        
        # Attempts to fit the model, should fail if the issue is present due to non-C-contiguous arrays
        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X[numerical_cols], y)
        
        # If the issue is fixed, exit with code 0
        print("The issue seems to be resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # If the issue is present, prints the stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

# Function to print stack trace in a detailed manner
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run this script:
- It will attempt to execute the code snippet that is expected to produce the `ValueError` as a consequence of the `ndarray` not being C-contiguous.
- If the problem persists (meaning the data is not automatically converted into a C-contiguous array as required by `ArrayData`), the script prints a stack trace of the issue and exits by raising an `AssertionError`.
- If the issue is resolved (meaning the conversion to C-contiguous arrays is handled properly, preventing the `ValueError`), then the script prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0, indicating the absence of the problem.
