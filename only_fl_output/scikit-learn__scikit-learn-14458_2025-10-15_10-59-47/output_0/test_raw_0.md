This script attempts to reproduce the specified issue by running the problematic code snippet. If the issue is present, it will print the stack trace of the exception and exit with an `AssertionError`. If no issue is encountered (indicating a potential fix has been applied), it prints a success message and exits cleanly with code 0.

This script adheres to the requested conditions, including:
- Standing alone as a Python file named `reproducer.py`.
- Capable of being executed in the root directory of a project with `python3 reproducer.py`.
- Designed to clearly output a stack trace for precise error identification if the issue persists.
- Exiting with code 0 if the issue is not present, conforming to the detailed error-handling specifications given.
