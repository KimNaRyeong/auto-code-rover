Certainly! Based on the initial task description and subsequent clarifications, here's an updated standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to replicate the issue. The objective is to trigger a `ValueError` due to a non-C-contiguous array when fitting a model, and gracefully handle the exception by printing a detailed stack trace. The file will exit with code 0 if the issue has been resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    try:
        # Fetches the dataset
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target

        # Defines columns of interest
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

        # Attempts to fit the Ridge model with the 'sag' solver
        # The fitting process should raise a ValueError if the issue is present
        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X[numerical_cols], y)

        print("Issue appears to be resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Prints the stack trace if an exception is encountered
        print_stacktrace(e)

        # Raises an AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)

    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)

    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script should be saved as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project. Upon execution with Python 3, it tries to fit a Ridge regression model with the specified numerical columns from the fetched dataset using the 'sag' solver. The purpose is to trigger the aforementioned `ValueError` due to a non-C-contiguous array. If this occurs, the script captures and prints the stack trace using the detailed formatting provided in your request. This way, the exact location and nature of the issue are clearly reported. If the problem has been resolved (e.g., by a library update or an upstream fix that handles the non-C-contiguous case), the script will terminate with a success message and exit code 0.
