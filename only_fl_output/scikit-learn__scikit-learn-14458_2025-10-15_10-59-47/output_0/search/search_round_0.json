        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more information about the classes and methods mentioned in the error and the issue description. Specifically, we should look into the `ArrayData` constructor (as it's directly mentioned in the error traceback), check if `check_array` or similar functionality is being used properly before data reaches `ArrayData`, and also understand the context of the call in `Ridge.fit()` method, since that's where the issue originates from.\n\nLet's start by examining the classes and methods involved:\n\n1. Review the definition and usage of `ArrayData` to understand its expectations regarding C-contiguity of numpy arrays.\n2. Investigate the `Ridge.fit` method, to understand how the data is being passed to `ArrayData`.\n3. Check the usage of `check_array` in `Ridge.fit` or earlier in the call stack to ensure arrays are properly validated or transformed to meet `ArrayData`'s requirements.\n\nThe following API calls will support gathering this context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ArrayData\")`: This will help us locate the class definition and any relevant comments or method definitions that specify the requirements for the data input, including why it expects a C-contiguous numpy array.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"Ridge\")`: To see how `Ridge.fit` handles the input data before passing it to `ArrayData` and whether there's any preprocessing or checks like `check_array` being performed.\n\n3. `search_code(\"check_array\")`: This will help us find instances where `check_array` is used in the codebase, particularly in relation to preparing data for `ArrayData`, which might provide a precedent for ensuring data contiguity or suggest a spot where such a check could be added. \n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive look at how the data is expected to be structured by `ArrayData`, any missing data preparation steps in the `Ridge` class, and potential spots for incorporating a `check_array` call to avoid the `ValueError`."
