        "intended_behavior": "The method(s) in `FileField` responsible for linking the field to its model should ensure that the `model` attribute of any `FileField` (including image fields, which are a subclass of `FileField`) correctly points back to the concrete model it belongs to. This linkage should not be broken or made ambiguous due to any refactorings or changes intended to optimize or clean up the code as might have happened after the fix for #31701. The intended behavior is to preserve or restore the ability for developers to introspect the model from the field, which is essential for a number of Django extensions and possibly for internal Django operations as well. This involves potentially revising the changes made around Django 3.2 that affected how `FileField` objects are associated with their models, specifically ensuring that `contribute_to_class` or any other method involved properly maintains the `model` attribute linkage without breaking existing functionality."
