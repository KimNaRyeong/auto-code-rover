Please describe.**\n[:kbd:](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#role-kbd) describes \"a sequence of keystrokes\". Sphinx converts it to a single [`<kbd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) element:\n```\n:kbd:`Control-x Control-f`\n```\nbecomes\n```html\n<kbd>Control-x Control-f</kbd>\n```\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nPotentially sphinx could parse the `:kbd:` value and convert it to individual (or nested) `<kbd>` elements, which is what [MDN suggests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd#Representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) as a way to represent key combinations. Something like:\n```html\n<-- Individual -->\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n<-- Nested -->\n<kbd>\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatively the sphinx user could rewrite their markup:\n```\n:kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`x` :kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`f`\n```\n**Related**\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3160\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4197\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get more context about the issue and how to approach solving it, we should perform the following searches:\n\n1. Since the issue is about the `:kbd:` role conversion in Sphinx documentation, we need to find out how Sphinx currently handles this role. We specifically need to look at the class or method that handles role conversion or parsing in the Sphinx codebase. The issue doesn't specify a class or method name, so we have to start broadly.\n\n2. The conversion happens when Sphinx parses reStructuredText (reST) directives and converts them into HTML. So, we're likely looking for a method that deals with parsing reST or converting it to HTML.\n\n3. We also know that this involves the `<kbd>` element specifically in the context of handling reStructuredText roles to HTML elements conversion.\n\nGiven these points, we should initially search for methods and code that could be directly involved in parsing and converting reStructuredText (reST) roles to HTML, particularly focusing on `:kbd:` if such direct references exist in the code.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n- search_method(\"parse_restructuredtext\")\n- search_method(\"convert_to_html\")\n- search_code(\":kbd:\")"
