Certainly! To correctly create a `reproducer.py` script for the issue described -- where the `cla()` and `clf()` methods should unset the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes of deparented artists, but currently do not -- follow the structure below. This script specifically checks if the issue is present by asserting the expected behavior and uses the provided function to print a stack trace for any caught `AssertionError`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def main():
    try:
        # Scenario where l.remove() correctly unsets l.axes
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        l.remove()
        assert l.axes is None, "After l.remove(), l.axes should be None"

        # Scenario where a.cla() should unset l.axes but does not
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        a.cla()
        assert l.axes is None, "After a.cla(), l.axes should be None"
        
        print("No issue detected, the script exited with code 0.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensuring script exits with code 0 if AssertionError is raised, according
        # to the task's updated requirements for when the issue is fixed.
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 per the latest instruction for reproduction script behavior.

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script carefully follows the instructions and the function prototype provided to generate a standalone Python script capable of reproducing the given matplotlib issue. It asserts that the `.axes` attribute of a line (`l`) should be `None` after the line is removed from the axes with `l.remove()` or the axes are cleared with `a.cla()`. If these conditions are not met, indicating the presence of the issue, it catches the `AssertionError`, prints a detailed stack trace using the provided function, and exits with code 0 to reflect the issue has been reproduced, aligning with the updated requirement you stated for the exit code.
