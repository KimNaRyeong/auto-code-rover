        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how window expressions and conditional statements (like `Case` and `When`) are evaluated and processed within Django's ORM layer. The regression mentioned seems to be a specific change affecting how Django ORM handles window expressions in `SELECT` clauses. Here are the API calls that would be most relevant to get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `NotSupportedError` to find where it's raised in relation to window functions or expressions within the Django ORM. This will help us understand the conditions under which the error is thrown.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"NotSupportedError\")\n```\n\n2. The `Window` class is crucial to understanding how window expressions are built and how they might interact with the ORM's mechanism for constructing queries. Getting context around its implementation will provide insights into potential locations for the regression.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Window\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue refers to the use of `Case` and `When` within an annotation, it's essential to examine these classes as well. This will give us insight into how conditional expressions are handled and evaluated, particularly in conjunction with window functions.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Case\")\nsearch_class(\"When\")\n```\n\n4. The error appears during the processing of an annotation which suggests that the issue might lie within the logic that handles the compilation or execution of annotations, particularly those involving window functions.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"annotate\")\n```\n\n5. Because the issue description specifically mentions that the regression was introduced in a certain commit (`4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4`), it would be beneficial to examine changes related to window expressions or the `annotate` method around this commit. Unfortunately, without direct access to the repository's commit history through these APIs, we can focus on the areas most likely affected based on the information provided.\n\nBy performing these searches, we aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of how Django's ORM handles window expressions and conditional statements within the `SELECT` clause and pinpoint where the regression might have been introduced."
