On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in relation to the reported issue about inconsistent datetime logging in Django's runserver:\n\n### WSGIRequestHandler\n- **What it does**: This class handles HTTP requests coming into the Django development server. Methods like `log_message`, `handle`, and `handle_one_request` are of particular interest for logging requests.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: The issue describes how `log_message` within this handler uses `server_time` calculated differently than other parts of the server logging system. Specifically, this would involve how timestamps are formatted and generated for logs.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the `log_message` method or related logging functionalities within `WSGIRequestHandler` should align with the rest of the Django's logging system in terms of datetime formatting, ensuring consistency across all logged messages.\n\n### WSGIServer\n- **What it does**: `WSGIServer` is a class extending the basic WSGI server to handle web requests. It includes configurations like `request_queue_size` and methods like `handle_error`.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: According to the issue description, `WSGIServer` uses logging without `server_time`, contrasting with `WSGIRequestHandler`'s method of logging. This discrepancy could lead to inconsistent logging formats.\n- **Intended behavior**: The server should either incorporate a consistent way of formatting timestamps in logs or allow configuration to specify how timestamps are formatted across different components including the `WSGIServer`.\n\n### ServerFormatter\n- **What it does**: `ServerFormatter` extends `logging.Formatter`, providing a custom formatter for log records. Key methods include the constructor, `format`, and potentially `uses_server_time` (though the exact use of this method is not detailed in the snippet).\n- **Relationship with the bug**: The custom `format` function in `ServerFormatter` might be where the inconsistency is addressed or could be further enhanced. Considering the issue, this class is likely where adjustments can be made to ensure consistent datetime formatting in logs.\n- **Intended behavior**: `ServerFormatter` should ensure consistent formatting of log messages, possibly by using the same timestamp format across all log messages or by allowing configurable formatting options.\n\nGiven the findings and the lack of code snippets for `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s`, it is clear that further investigation is needed in areas directly involved in logging configuration and format specification. Given this, additional API calls that could enrich the context include:\n- Searching for documentation or comments that suggest the logging format, since direct code snippets weren't found. This might include default configurations for Django's development server logging.\n- Investigating how `log_message` within `WSGIRequestHandler` generates and formats `server_time`.\n- Examining how the `format` method in `ServerFormatter` applies the timestamp and if it can or does use `server_time` or `asctime`.\n\nHowever, given the restriction to API calls and the need for direct context, focusing on code where datetime formatting is explicitly mentioned or implied might be the next step. Since no direct hits were found for `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s`, examining nearby code especially in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py` and `django/utils/log.py` could provide clues or pathways for making the logging system more consistent and, ideally, configurable:\n\n- Search for logging configuration or formatting within these files might uncover how these formats are applied and potential discrepancies between them."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. \n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: django/core/servers/basehttp.py\n  - **Class**: WSGIRequestHandler\n  - **Method**: log_message\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `log_message` method should be modified or extended to use a consistent datetime format for logging, aligning with the format used by `WSGIServer`. This may involve either directly formatting the datetime in the log message using a standardized format string or ensuring any datetime objects passed to logging methods are formatted consistently across the server. It is essential that this format be configurable, allowing developers to specify the datetime format string used in `settings.py`.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: django/core/servers/basehttp.py\n  - **Class**: WSGIServer\n  - **Intended Behavior**: While the specific method causing inconsistency isn't pinpointed, the initialization and logging configuration parts of `WSGIServer` might need to ensure that any logged messages, including errors or system logs, adhere to the same datetime formatting rules as those applied in `WSGIRequestHandler`. If logging in `WSGIServer` does not directly involve datetime formatting, ensuring consistency might involve passing formatted datetime strings to the logging system or applying a consistent formatting approach via a shared configuration or formatter object.\n\n- **Bug Location 3**: \n  - **File**: django/utils/log.py\n  - **Class**: ServerFormatter\n  - **Method**: format\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `format` method should be enhanced to support configurable date formats, possibly by allowing the format to be specified via Django settings. This would involve checking for a user-defined datetime format in the settings and applying it when formatting log messages. If `uses_server_time` method implies a custom handling of timestamps, ensuring this method also respects the configured format would be necessary to achieve overall consistency in datetime logging.\n\nThese changes aim to unify the datetime logging format across different parts of the Django server, ensuring that whether it's a request log via `WSGIRequestHandler` or system/error logs via `WSGIServer` and `ServerFormatter`, they all use a consistent and configurable datetime format. This would not only resolve the inconsistency issue but also enhance Django's logging system's flexibility."
