However, this is not currently the case. For example, consider a model with the following class variable:\npub_date = models.DateTimeField(\"date published\")\nChanging the publication date for an object of that model, will display \"Changed pub_date.\" in its admin history, rather than \"Change date published.\" as one would expect (as older versions of Django did).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of models history not using verbose names in Django's admin, we need to understand how the history logging mechanism works and where the verbose names should be used. To gather the needed context, let's invoke a few API calls to look into the admin and model sections of the project.\n\n1. Let's start by finding out where the model's history changes are being logged. This could be in a method related to saving or updating the model's history in the Django admin. We can look for methods named similarly to \"log_change\", \"save_history\", or \"log_history\" that may handle these operations.\n\n2. Since the issue describes a scenario where a field's verbose name is not being used, we also need the context around how field names are retrieved and used when creating history messages. This could involve methods or functions that serialize model fields for logging purposes. Necessary methods could be named like \"get_field_names\", \"get_verbose_name\", or similar.\n\n3. Lastly, it's worth checking if there's a specific utility or handler in the Django admin responsible for formatting history messages. This could involve searching for helper functions or methods that format these logs.\n\nI will make the following API calls based on the steps outlined above:\n\n- search_method(\"log_change\")\n- search_method(\"save_history\")\n- search_method(\"log_history\")\n- search_code(\"get_verbose_name\")\n- search_code(\"Changed pub_date\")"
