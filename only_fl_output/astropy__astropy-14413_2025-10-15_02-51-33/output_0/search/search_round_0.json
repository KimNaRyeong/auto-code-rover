        "content": "To effectively gather the context needed to address the issue regarding spaces in unit representations in `unicode` and `console` format in Astropy, we should perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the method where the issue likely originates, which is the method responsible for converting units to a string representation. The description suggests an issue with `to_string`, so search for this method in the context of the unit formatting: `search_method(method_name=\"to_string\")`.\n\n2. Given the formats discussed (`unicode` and `console`), we should also find where these formats are handled or defined in the codebase. Since `format` is a parameter for `to_string`, we need to understand how it influences the output: `search_code(code_str=\"unicode\")` and `search_code(code_str=\"console\")`.\n\nThese searches will help us pinpoint where in the code the issue of the leading space is introduced or can be corrected."
