        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have significant insights into how `BaseFormSet` operates, especially concerning `empty_form` and how `form_kwargs` are managed. Let's delve into the details:\n\n### 1. `BaseFormSet` Class Overview\n\nThe `BaseFormSet` class is foundational for creating formsets in Django, enabling multiple forms of the same type to be displayed and processed together. It's especially relevant for our issue since the problem resides in how `empty_form` behaves when `empty_permitted` is specified in `form_kwargs`.\n\n### Analysis of `__init__` Method in `BaseFormSet`\n\n```python\ndef __init__(\n    self,\n    data=None,\n    files=None,\n    auto_id=\"id_%s\",\n    prefix=None,\n    initial=None,\n    error_class=ErrorList,\n    form_kwargs=None,\n    error_messages=None,\n):\n```\n\nThis method initializes a new instance of `BaseFormSet`, taking various parameters, including `form_kwargs`, which allows custom arguments to be passed to forms within the formset. This is directly related to the issue, as `empty_permitted` is being passed through `form_kwargs`, impacting how forms are initialized and validated.\n\n### Analysis of `empty_form` Method in `BaseFormSet`\n\n```python\ndef empty_form(self):\n    form = self.form(\n        auto_id=self.auto_id,\n        prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n        empty_permitted=True,\n        use_required_attribute=False,\n        **self.get_form_kwargs(None),\n        renderer=self.renderer,\n    )\n    self.add_fields(form, None)\n    return form\n```\n\nHere, the `empty_form` property plays a crucial role by generating a template form that can be used to add additional items dynamically on the client side. Notably, `empty_permitted=True` is hardcoded, suggesting that each `empty_form` inherently allows being empty, which is logical since it's a template for new entries rather than a form meant to be submitted with data initially.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe issue states that specifying `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` leads to a `KeyError` when rendering `empty_form`. However, the analysis shows that `empty_form` already explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True`, which should render any `empty_permitted` value passed via `form_kwargs` redundant, at least for the `empty_form` case. This contradiction hints at a probable oversight in handling `form_kwargs` when generating the `empty_form`.\n\n### Intended Behavior Regarding the Issue\n\nGiven the issue description and the insights from the codebase:\n- **Expected behavior**: `form_kwargs` including `empty_permitted` should be applied to actual form instances within the formset but not affect the `empty_form`, as `empty_permitted` is fixed at `True` for `empty_form`. The system should either ignore `empty_permitted` when generating `empty_form` or ensure it does not cause conflicts/key errors during processing.\n- **Actual Issue Encountered**: The application crashes with a `KeyError` when `empty_permitted` is explicitly passed in `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`, indicating a mishandling or misinterpretation of `form_kwargs` during `empty_form` generation.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Investigate** how `get_form_kwargs(None)` is implemented, specifically how it processes `None` and whether it correctly filters or adjusts `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`.\n- **Review** the entire workflow of `form_kwargs` application to forms in the formset, focusing on exception handling for keys or arguments irrelevant for some forms, like `empty_form`.\n  \nTo conclude, the code's expected behavior clashes with the encountered bug due to how `form_kwargs` and its contents are applied to or ignored by `empty_form`. Further investigation should target the handling and filtering of `form_kwargs` for compatibility with fixed attributes of `empty_form`."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This means ensuring that the `empty_form` remains functional even when `empty_permitted` is explicitly set in `form_kwargs`. This could potentially involve filtering out `empty_permitted` from the `form_kwargs` before they are applied to `empty_form` if it's determined that explicitly setting `empty_permitted` within `form_kwargs` leads to conflicts or errors. The preservation of existing functionality implies that any modifications should not interfere with how `form_kwargs` are applied to other forms within the formset\u2014only to `empty_form`, in a way that respects its unique role and requirements (namely, that it should always have `empty_permitted=True`).\n\nThe solution should focus on ensuring the `empty_form` property in `BaseFormSet` handles `form_kwargs` in a way that avoids the KeyError and maintains the expected behavior of `empty_permitted` for all forms within the formset, including the `empty_form`. This might involve enhancing how `get_form_kwargs(None)` is executed or introducing additional logic to selectively apply or ignore `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`."
