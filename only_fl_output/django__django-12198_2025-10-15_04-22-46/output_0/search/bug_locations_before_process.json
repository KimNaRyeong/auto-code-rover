        "intended_behavior": "The `sensitive_variables` decorator should be adjusted to ensure that it preserves the signature of the decorated function. This can be achieved by ensuring that any wrapping performed by the decorator does not modify the function's signature in a way that makes it unrecognizable to `inspect.getcallargs`. Utilizing `functools.wraps` is a step in the right direction but may require further refinement or additional mechanisms to explicitly preserve and expose the original function signature, even when variables are marked as sensitive."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary issue may not directly lie within the `authenticate` function itself, ensuring that this function and its interaction with `inspect.getcallargs` accommodate the presence of decorators like `sensitive_variables` is crucial. This may not necessitate a direct change in the `authenticate` function but a revision on how backends are validated against provided credentials. Ensuring that `inspect.getcallargs` can accurately interpret and validate credentials against a possibly decorated `authenticate` method in custom backends without falsely proceeding or raising a TypeError is essential. This might include a more sophisticated method of evaluating a backend's `authenticate` method's compatibility with provided credentials, potentially involving introspection techniques that reliably discern the original method signature post-decoration."
