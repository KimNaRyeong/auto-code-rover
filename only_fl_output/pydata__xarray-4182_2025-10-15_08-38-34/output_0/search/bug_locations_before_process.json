This could involve adjusting the HTML template or JavaScript used to generate the collapsible sections, ensuring they are rendered in an expanded state by default. Care must be taken to ensure this does not negatively impact the performance or usability, especially when dealing with large datasets. The existing functionality for interactive exploration (e.g., collapsing and expanding sections) should be preserved."

The modification should keep in mind the consistent and intuitive display of datasets, especially those with complex structures or backed by Dask arrays. The change should preserve the user's ability to interact with the representation for large datasets, such as collapsing/expanding sections as needed."
