        "content": "To address the issue regarding the HTML representation of DataArray/Variable in xarray and the proposal to pre-expand data and attributes sections by default, we need to gather more context about how the HTML representation is generated and handled within the xarray project. Specifically, we need to look into the classes and methods that generate the HTML representation for DataArray and Variable objects. \n\nGiven the nature of the issue, we might be interested in the methods that are involved in creating the HTML repr (representation) of these objects. It is likely that the logic for deciding whether sections are expanded or collapsed by default is contained within these methods or related utility functions. \n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the `DataArray` and `Variable` classes to understand the objects' structure:\n   - `search_class(\"DataArray\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Variable\")`\n\n2. Search for methods that could be responsible for generating the HTML repr within these classes or related code. Since the issue doesn't specify exact method names, we'll start by searching for a common method name used in Python for HTML representations, `._repr_html_`, within the entire codebase:\n   - `search_method(\"_repr_html_\")`\n\n3. Additionally, the issue mentions improvements to the repr for nested dask arrays. It might be useful to also understand how those representations are generated. Searching for \"dask array\" related code might give insights into specific handling for dask arrays within xarray:\n   - `search_code(\"dask array\")`\n\nThese searches aim to gather sufficient context about where and how the decision to expand or collapse sections in the HTML representation is implemented, which will be crucial for proposing a modification to pre-expand data and attributes by default."
