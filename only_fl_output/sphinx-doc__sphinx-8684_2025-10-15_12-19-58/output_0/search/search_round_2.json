        "content": "Based on the collected context, it appears our relevant findings are centered around the code snippets containing `\"indentation\"` within the Sphinx project files. Given the nature of the issue, which is to make the `:dedent:` option for `code-block` and `literalinclude` more flexible or intuitive, similar to Python's `textwrap.dedent`, these files are likely to be in or around the functionality that needs to be modified or extended.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The code snippets found likely relate to handling indentation in documentation strings or files. Sphinx is a tool used for generating documentation, which aligns with the context of the issue regarding `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives. Functions within these files probably deal with formatting or parsing documentation to maintain consistent indentation or modify it according to directive options.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given the issue's focus on indentation management for certain directives, these snippets are very likely to be the places where the `:dedent:` behavior is implemented or where it could be extended to meet the issue's requirements. The presence of indentation-related functionality in these files signifies where Sphinx processes directives and applies formatting rules, which directly ties into the requested feature enhancement.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to modify or extend the existing handling of indentation, specifically for the `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives, to automatically dedent text as Python's `textwrap.dedent` does when no explicit `:dedent:` value is provided. It requires implementing an automatic deduction of the common whitespace prefix from each line in text blocks defined under these directives, much like how `textwrap.dedent` operates in Python. This would entail an enhancement in the logic within these areas to auto-detect and remove excessive indentation, thus making documentation cleaner and reducing manual formatting efforts.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\nGiven this analysis, we need a detailed examination of the code within the mentioned files to precisely identify the methods or logic blocks where enhancements or changes should be made.\n\n1. **Location 1:**\n   - **File:** `sphinx/pycode/parser.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Investigate how indentation is processed in this file to extend or modify the handling in accordance with the new `:dedent:` expectations for relevant directives. Ensure that if `:dedent:` is not specified, a general dedent is applied, removing the common leading whitespace from all lines.\n\n2. **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `sphinx/domains/std.py`, `sphinx/util/docstrings.py`, `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** In each of these files, examine the directive processing mechanisms to integrate automatic dedentation where required. The goal is to detect and implement a parsing extension that automatically adjusts indentation based on the common minimum whitespace, specifically for `code-block` and `literalinclude` contexts.\n\nGiven this plan, the next step would be to inspect these files and identify specific methods or classes where modifications are required. Further searches may not be necessary at this stage, as the located files should encompass the logic pertinent to the issue at hand."

To resolve the issue, the parser's handling of code blocks should be extended to automatically dedent them unless a specific `:dedent:` value is given. This will allow for easier inclusion of code samples without manually adjusting indentation.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/domains/std.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** As this file likely includes directive processing logic for the standard domain, it should be ensured that the `:dedent:` option for `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives automatically removes common leading whitespace from all lines in the absence of an explicit dedent value. The change should maintain backward compatibility, allowing users to still specify a dedent value when desired.\n\n- **Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/util/docstrings.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This file is probably responsible for processing docstring content. Enhancements should be made to apply the automatic dedentation logic for code blocks and literal includes within docstrings, applying a universal dedent if no `:dedent:` value is specified. This modifies the docstring handling to better format embedded code snippets.\n\n- **Location 4:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This file's functionality includes automatically documenting Python source code files. The modification needed here involves ensuring that when extracting docstrings that include `code-block` or `literalinclude` directives, an automatic dedent is applied to these blocks if they lack a specific `:dedent:` value. This change should gracefully handle existing documentation and new inclusions alike, promoting ease of documentation writing and consistency in documentation appearance.\n\nThese intended behaviors aim to seamlessly integrate the new dedentation logic without disrupting existing functionality, providing a more intuitive experience for documentation authors."
