        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding extending the `:dedent:` behavior for `code-block` and `literalinclude`, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code where these directives are implemented or processed. Based on the issue description, it sounds like these directives are likely part of a documentation generator or a similar tool that processes text files. They might be defined in classes or methods related to rendering or processing markup language.\n\nFirst, let's identify any classes or methods that specifically handle the `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives, as well as any existing implementation of `:dedent:`. Since the issue description mentions the behavior being more akin to Python's `textwrap.dedent`, it's likely we are looking for parsing or text processing parts of the code.\n\n1. Search for the classes or methods handling the `code-block` directive:\n   - `search_method(\"code-block\")`\n   \n2. Search for the classes or methods handling the `literalinclude` directive:\n   - `search_method(\"literalinclude\")`\n\n3. Search for any existing implementation or handling of `:dedent:`:\n   - `search_code(\":dedent:\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by identifying relevant sections of the codebase."
