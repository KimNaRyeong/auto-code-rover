        "intended_behavior": "The `create_new_paste` method should accurately submit any text content to bpaste.net without causing HTTP errors due to lexer mismatches. To resolve the issue, the method should set the `lexer` parameter to `\"text\"` instead of `\"python3\"` within the `params` dictionary. This change ensures that the bpaste.net service treats the uploaded content as arbitrary text, which is more appropriate for the variety of output `pytest` may produce. It preserves the existing functionality of uploading text to bpaste.net while preventing the HTTP 400 error caused by specifying an incorrect lexer for non-Python content."
