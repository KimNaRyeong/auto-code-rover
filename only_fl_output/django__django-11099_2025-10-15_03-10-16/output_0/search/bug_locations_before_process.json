        "intended_behavior": "The `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class is intended to validate usernames containing only English letters, numbers, and specific symbols (`@`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `_`) without allowing trailing newline characters. To resolve the issue, the regex pattern in the `regex` attribute must be changed from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change ensures that the end of the string is explicitly defined to not include newline characters, preserving the existing functionality while preventing the acceptance of usernames ending with a newline."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class should enforce that usernames consist solely of letters (Unicode supported), numbers, and the symbols `@`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `_` without allowing trailing newline characters. The regex pattern shall be updated from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'` to properly prevent usernames from ending with a newline character. This action fixes the issue while maintaining the validator\u2019s purpose to include a wider range of character encodings in usernames."
