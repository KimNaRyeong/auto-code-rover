Specifically, when `remainder='drop'` is used, and additional columns are present in `X`, the transformation should proceed without errors, focusing on the columns it was fit on. The method should warn the user about ignoring additional columns unless explicitly stated otherwise in a new or existing parameter."

        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new method or attribute for tracking `n_features_in_` or a similar concept that notes the number (and possibly names) of columns the `ColumnTransformer` was fit on. This capability will enhance input validation by enabling a check against the column structure of data passed to `transform`, thus respecting the principle that the shape and ordering of input data should match that seen during fitting, with allowances made where logically consistent (e.g., additional columns ignored when not impacting the transform outcome)."
