        "intended_behavior": "The `floatformat` method should ensure its output string is compatible with Django's gettext string formatting. Given the issue where passing floats directly causes `TypeError` in translation scenarios, an intended behavior could include a condition to stringify floats in a numeric context recognized by gettext (e.g., ensuring formatted string represents a valid numeric value without trailing dots or unconventional numeric formatting). Additionally, ensuring that the output from `floatformat` does not disrupt Django's translation string interpolation mechanism by potentially adjusting the output format to align with common numeric representations accepted across different locales."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that the `do_translate` method is responsible for processing translation tags, it should robustly handle the incorporation of variables into translation strings, particularly when these variables come from filters that format data types like floats. While the method primarily orchestrates translation tag processing, its intended behavior changes could involve: Enhancing error handling to provide more informative messages when a translation fails due to variable type incompatibilities, guiding developers towards resolution. Potentially implementing or utilizing a mechanism to assure that formatted string variables, especially those modified by `floatformat`, maintain their integrity and type compatibility within the translation process."
