        "intended_behavior": "The `astype` method should be updated to include an `order` parameter, aligning its functionality with that of `numpy.ndarray.astype`. This method should then handle the `order` parameter appropriately when casting the data type of the arrays. The implementation should ensure that when the `order` parameter is specified, it affects the memory layout of the returned array as expected ('C' for row-major and 'F' for column-major order, etc.). This change must preserve the existing functionality of allowing data type casting while extending it to support order specification."

The implementation should ensure that the `order` parameter meaningfully alters the memory layout of the array, respecting the underlying data handling and representation logic in xarray."
