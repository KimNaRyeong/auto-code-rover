Given the feedback, let's correct the code format in the `print_stacktrace` function and ensure the script addresses the specific testing scenario as requested. The error observed previously indicates an environment issue rather than the script's logic, so please ensure the correct environment and xarray version are being used.

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    try:
        import xarray as xr

        # Verifying the version of xarray
        version = xr.__version__
        print(f"xarray version: {version}")

        # Creating a data array and attempting to use the 'order' parameter with astype method
        strides = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).astype(dtype='d', order='F').values.strides
        
        # Asserting to cause failure if the issue exists
        assert strides == (8, 16), "astype method order parameter is not functioning as expected."
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catching assertion errors and printing detailed stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Re-raise the exception to exit with a non-zero status code if the test fails
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other exception, including the loss of the 'order' parameter
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Re-raise the exception to ensure the script exits with a non-zero status code

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please make sure the environment where this script is executed has the correct version of `xarray` installed that you wish to test against. The error message received previously implies there might be an issue related to the `numpy` version, possibly being too advanced for the installed `xarray` version. Adjusting the environment to match the required dependencies for `xarray` version `0.16.2` (the version with the reported issue) should resolve environment-related problems.
