See the attached log: [sphinx-err-325ndteh.log](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/files/4842672/sphinx-err-325ndteh.log)\n**To Reproduce**\n```\n$ git https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n$ cd screenpy/docs\n$ python -m venv env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install sphinx pyhamcrest selenium typing_extensions\n$ make html\n```\nObserve the docs command fails with a TypeError.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs can still be built when generics are involved.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac 10.15.5 (19F101)\n- Python version: 3.7.7\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  sphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.intersphinx, sphinx.ext.coverage, sphinx.ext.ifconfig, sphinx.ext.napoleon\n**Additional context**\nThis might just be me not knowing how to make Sphinx-friendly generic typing, if that's the case please let me know!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather information about where and how generically-typed classes are being handled in the `screenpy` project, specifically in relation to Sphinx documentation generation. Given the information from the issue, we are interested in how Sphinx's Autodoc extension, or potentially the project's configuration, is interacting with Python's typing, especially generic types. The error mentioned involves `mock._make_subclass` which suggests that the problem may be related to how subclasses or generic types are mocked or documented by Sphinx Autodoc.\n\nGiven the context, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a problem with generically-typed classes and Sphinx's Autodoc extension, it's crucial to understand how these classes are defined in the `screenpy` project. However, without explicit class names or files mentioned, we cannot directly target our search. Hence, an initial step might involve a manual review to identify key generically-typed classes in the project documentation or by browsing the project's codebase if accessible.\n\n2. The error from Sphinx (`mock._make_subclass` throwing `TypeError`) is very specific. Although we don't have the exact location or subclass causing the issue, searching for the `mock._make_subclass` usage within the Sphinx configuration or extension files in the `screenpy` project might provide some insights. However, without direct access to project files via API and given that `mock._make_subclass` is likely part of Sphinx's internal mechanisms rather than the project's code, our search via APIs is limited in scope for this specific internal call.\n\n3. The issue description does not provide direct snippets of code or specific configurations that lead to the TypeError, making it difficult to target our search without further information on how generics are utilized in the project. Searching for \"generic class\" or related typing extensions features used (`TypeVar`, possibly) without knowing the exact usage patterns or class names in the project might not yield meaningful results directly via the APIs provided.\n\nGiven these constraints, the most effective approach to gather context for the issue would likely require:\n- A review of the `screenpy` project's documentation and codebase to identify how generically-typed classes are implemented and referenced in Sphinx documentation.\n- An examination of the Sphinx configuration used in the `screenpy` project (`conf.py` or similar) and any custom extensions or settings that might affect how Autodoc processes typing information.\n\nWithout specific class names, method names, or code snippets to target our search, and considering the issue's focus on the interaction between generically-typed classes and Sphinx's documentation generation process, our ability to directly utilize the provided search APIs is limited.\n\nFor addressing the issue accurately, obtaining more specific information or being able to browse the project's codebase manually would be necessary steps to inform subsequent queries or API calls."

Since the bug involves generically-typed classes and their interaction with Sphinx's Autodoc, it would be valuable to look at how these classes are defined and documented within the `screenpy` project. Although we don't have specific class names, we're looking for instances where `TypeVar` might be used or where generic type annotations are prominent. This information is essential but not directly accessible through the APIs without knowing specific class names or files.\n\n2. The error mentioned involves `mock._make_subclass` and `TypeError` due to the concatenation of a `str` and a `TypeVar`, which points toward the implementation within Sphinx or the customization in the `screenpy` project that handles these types. Without direct access to Sphinx's internal code or knowing how `screenpy` might extend or customize Sphinx or Autodoc functionality, we can't accurately target the search through these APIs.\n\nGiven these considerations, a different approach to directly invoke the APIs without specific argument values is necessary. We need to formulate a hypothetical approach that might involve:\n\n- Identifying generically-typed classes within the `screenpy` project by reviewing documentation or source code to find class names.\n- Reviewing Sphinx configuration or customization within the project that pertains to documentation generation, specifically looking for Autodoc settings or extensions.\n\nIf specific classes or custom Sphinx extension modules were named, we could execute API calls like:\n\n- `search_class(\"ClassName\")` to find the generically-typed class causing issues.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"TypeVar\", \"path/to/sphinx_extension.py\")` to search for usages of `TypeVar` in Sphinx extension modules (with a hypothetical file path).\n\nHowever, without direct identifiers, such as class names or specific customization files, executing these APIs as initially requested is not feasible."

Search for usage of `TypeVar` across the project, as it's crucial for defining generic classes, which seems to relate to the issue at hand.\n2. Search for a common generically-typed class definition pattern in Python, which might help in identifying how such classes are set up in the project, assuming that `GenericType[T]` could be a placeholder for actual usages in the project.\n\nGiven these considerations, the API calls could be:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"TypeVar\")\nsearch_code(\"GenericType[T]\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to find code snippets that define generic types or use `TypeVar`, potentially leading to identifying files or classes that are relevant to the Sphinx documentation issue described."
