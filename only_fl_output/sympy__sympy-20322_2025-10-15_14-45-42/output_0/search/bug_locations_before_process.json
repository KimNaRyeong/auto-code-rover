This preserves user intent and ensures that subsequent calls to `simplify` or other operations do not inadvertently change the expression's form. The intended behavior is to ensure that the AST transformation respects the `evaluate` parameter throughout, consistently interpreting and maintaining the structure of mathematical expressions including `ceiling`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method should correctly handle expressions returned by `sympify` with `evaluate=False`, ensuring that the simplification process respects the original structure of expressions involving `ceiling`. If `sympify` is maintaining structure as intended, `simplify` needs to account for such structures by preventing over-aggressive simplification that changes the expression's meaning or representation, especially in cases where `evaluate=False` might result in different AST representations. The behavior should be consistent regardless of the `evaluate` parameter to `sympify`, ensuring that expressions like `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` are simplified in a mathematically equivalent manner that respects the user's intent regarding evaluation."
