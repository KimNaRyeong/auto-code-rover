Instead of enforcing X to be an array or sparse matrix of numerics, the validation step should verify if the base estimator can handle the data format of X. If the base estimator can process more versatile data types (e.g., lists of text blobs), _validate_estimator should not restrict this capability."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the fit method to accommodate and check for the flexible handling of different data types by the base estimator. Before validation and feeding X to the base estimator, the fit method should verify that X's format is compatible with the base estimator's requirements. This may involve incorporating a check that adjusts or skips stringent data type validations if the base estimator is known to support more flexible data inputs. The overall functionality of fitting the model should remain intact, with the only change being the more adaptable handling of input data types."
