The enhancement should preserve the function\u2019s ability to iterate through middleware settings and append error messages accordingly, but with added logic to validate the correct order of middleware. After ensuring all required middlewares are present, it could iterate again or simultaneously check that if AuthenticationMiddleware is present, SessionMiddleware must precede it in the order, producing a new, specific error message if this condition is not met."

        "intended_behavior": "While the AssertionError thrown here is essentially an operational safeguard, its messaging could be enhanced to be more informative or directive regarding the proper ordering of middlewares, in addition to its current checks. However, ideally, with the proper checks implemented as described above in the admin checks, developers would be guided correctly before this assertion error can be raised. Enhancing the error message could still serve as a final catch, ensuring developers are well-informed of the cause. A potential modification could involve adding suggestions or a more detailed exception message that instructs the correct middleware order explicitly, thereby aiding in quicker resolution from the developers\u2019 end without having to consult documentation separately. This message should instruct to inspect the MIDDLEWARE setting for not only the presence of SessionMiddleware but also its order relative to AuthenticationMiddleware."
