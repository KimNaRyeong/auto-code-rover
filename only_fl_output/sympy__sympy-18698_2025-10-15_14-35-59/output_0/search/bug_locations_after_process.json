The method should remain as is if it correctly implements square-free factorization, but it's crucial to verify that its output is consistently in a form that `sqf_list` can accurately process. If any adjustments are needed, they should be focused on ensuring that the polynomial data handed off to `sqf_list` is in a format that doesn\u2019t lead to the misrepresentation of factor multiplicities. If `sqf` is found to correctly perform its function, no change is necessary here, but it must be confirmed that errors in `sqf_list` are not due to misinterpretation of `sqf` outputs."
