        "content": "<issue>.htaccesss redirect to non ASCII folder does not work\nHello,\nI have the following setup on a shared hoster:\n- Apache 2.2.15\n- A Japanese language .\u307f\u3093\u306a (.minna; xn--q9jyb4c) IDN domain.\n- A blog which is in the subfolder \u30d6\u30ed\u30b0 (blog)\n- A redirect in the .htaccess file like this: `Redirect /index.html /\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0/`\nSo I usually open the domain http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a and the server redirects to http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0. This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to handling redirects to non-ASCII folder names in `.htaccess` configuration, executing targeted search API calls will be crucial. From the description, we need to understand how the project (probably a web server or a web application framework) handles `.htaccess` files and manages redirects. Specifically, the project might have custom handling for `.htaccess` files or might interact with the Apache server configuration in a specific way, including the processing of URIs with non-ASCII characters. Reflecting on the problem, useful information might be retrieved about:\n\n1. How redirection rules are parsed and executed from `.htaccess` files.\n2. Encoding handling for non-ASCII URIs during redirects.\n\nGiven we don't have explicit names of classes, methods, or files related to `.htaccess` handling or URI encoding from the issue description, our approach will start broadly and then narrow down based on findings. Here are some API calls that could provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for any code snippets or functions that handle redirects, specifically looking for \u201cRedirect\u201d or `.htaccess` related logic. This could provide leads on where and how redirect rules are processed.\n2. Since `.htaccess` is an Apache-related configuration, it's plausible that the project has utilities or modules specifically for handling Apache configurations. Searching for \"Apache\" or \".htaccess\" in class names or code snippets might reveal relevant parts of the project.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"Redirect /index.html\")\nsearch_code(\".htaccess\")\nsearch_code(\"URLEncoder\")  # To check if there's any standard URL encoding utility being used\nsearch_class(\"ApacheConfig\")\nsearch_code(\"encoding\")\n```\n\nGiven the wide scope, the intention is to first identify areas of the code that deal with redirect processing, `.htaccess` files, and encoding issues, which are likely at the heart of the described bug. Depending on the results from these initial searches, more targeted follow-up queries can be made to delve deeper into relevant classes, methods, or configuration files."
