    # This option 'set_output(transform="pandas")' is used for illustrative purposes
    # as it mimics the proposed solution mechanism and does not exist as of the knowledge cutoff in July 2021.
    # This line would potentially be modified or removed once the feature is implemented or if the API changes.
    # For the sake of this reproducible example, let's pretend this method exists and is correctly setting the output format.
    #selector.set_output(transform="pandas")
    X_out = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
    
    # Check for dtype preservation
    try:
        assert X_out.dtypes["petal width (cm)"] == np.float16, "petal width (cm) dtype not preserved"

Note: The `selector.set_output(transform="pandas")` is depicted based on the proposed solution and reflects how one might envision using a method or feature within the sklearn interface to specify output types or formats post-transformation, which doesn't exist as of the latest updates available to me. Hence, this part of the script serves illustrative purposes to conceptually align with the initial issue description and isn't actual runnable code in the current sklearn version.
