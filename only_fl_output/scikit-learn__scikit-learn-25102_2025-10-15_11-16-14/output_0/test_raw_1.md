Given the initial description, the above script checks if the dtypes are preserved post transformation which is the core of the issue. However, it's important to note that `SelectKBest` may drop columns based on their scores which means that categorical data or certain float types might not be present in the output `DataFrame`. 

Therefore, the assertion might not be directly related to the preservation of dtypes in terms of transformation output (since it might just assert on columns that have remained), but it sets the stage for checking the integrity of the transformation in the context provided. This assumes an environment where the primary concern is whether the `.fit_transform()` method preserves the data types of the input `DataFrame`.
