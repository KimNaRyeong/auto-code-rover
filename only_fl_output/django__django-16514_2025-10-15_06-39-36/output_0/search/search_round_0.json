It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to filtering `LogEntries` by registered models within the `AdminSite`, we need to gather information from the relevant classes and methods within the Django codebase. Given the nature of the ticket, we'll likely need to look into the implementation of `LogEntry`, `AdminSite`, and any mechanism they use to filter or display log entries. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`: This search will help us understand how `LogEntry` objects are structured and likely give insight into how they are currently being retrieved unfiltered.\n\n2. `search_class(\"AdminSite\")`: By examining the `AdminSite` class, we can understand how models are registered and potentially identify existing methods that we could extend or modify to filter `LogEntry` objects by the registered models.\n\n3. `search_method(\"register\")`: Since the issue mentions registering models to an `AdminSite`, finding the `register` method will help us understand how models are associated with a specific `AdminSite`.\n\n4. `search_method(\"get_queryset\")`: It's common in Django for lists of objects to be controlled by overriding the `get_queryset` method in model admins. Finding how this method is used within the context of `AdminSite` or related classes might reveal insights into how log entries can be filtered."
