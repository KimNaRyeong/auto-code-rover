When the `autoreload` option is set to `True`, this should enable the template backend to utilize a caching mechanism that also supports checking for changes in template files. The existing functionality for initializing the backend and configuring it based on provided parameters should be preserved, while adding the capability to register or acknowledge an autoreload mechanism."

        "intended_behavior": "Considering there was no direct reference to a `CachedLoader` class in the provided API search results, but assuming its existence based on Django's naming and implementation patterns, the intended behavior here would be to enhance or ensure the `get_template` method (or equivalent functionality within the cached loading mechanism) supports autoreloading. This means implementing a check for template file changes before serving a cached version of a template. If a change is detected, the loader should refresh its cache for the changed template. This behavior should only be activated when the `autoreload` option is enabled in the backend configuration to avoid affecting performance in production environments."
