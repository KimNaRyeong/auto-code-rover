As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue reported, it's crucial to gather more context about how attributes and their type hints are handled in the classes mentioned. The issue points to the use of `attrs` and potentially `dataclasses` for declaring class attributes with type hints, and a problem occurs when generating documentation using Sphinx's `napoleon` extension. Attributes are not getting their types from annotations when using the google-style docstring format.\n\nWe will need to inspect the implementation of the classes mentioned in the issue, especially focusing on their attribute declarations and any related Sphinx directives or configuration utilized for documentation purposes. Since the issue specifically mentions issues with the documentation of class attributes when using type hints, and points out potential related issues in Sphinx's handling, it makes sense to explore the classes in the `pheres` project, particularly those involved with `attrs` or `dataclasses`.\n\nFrom the issue description, the `[code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)` provides a direct pointer to where we should look first.\n\nGiven this information, the initial set of API calls should focus on inspecting the relevant class definitions within the specified `exceptions.py` file. This would include fetching the context around class definitions and any peculiar or undocumented use of `attrs` or `dataclasses`. Since the issue description does not mention specific class names, we have to broadly search within the given file.\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"BaseException\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"attr.s(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n3. `search_code_in_file(\"dataclass(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find instances of class declarations using `attr.s` or `@dataclass`, and a look at `BaseException` as a generic attempt to find a potentially relevant class, assuming it might be inheriting or related to Python's built-in `BaseException` but could be customized within the `pheres` project.\n\nThis approach will provide a foundation upon which to build a deeper understanding of how the project defines and documents its attributes, which is essential for addressing the issue at hand."

        "content": "Given the results indicating that the file `src/pheres/exceptions.py` cannot be found in the codebase, it seems I attempted to access a file that either doesn't exist or is located at a different path. The original problem formulation targets a real-world issue related to Sphinx documentation generation for Python projects using `attr.s` from `attrs` or `@dataclass` from the `dataclasses` module, along with type hints. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the documentation generated for class attributes correctly includes type information without duplication.\n\nTo correct my approach, given that direct queries to the specified file yielded no results, I should consider alternative strategies. Without access to the actual file path as stated in the issue description, my next step should revolve around more general inquiries that might illuminate how `attr.s` and `dataclasses` are typically handled within the project's context or how Sphinx is configured for autodocumentation.\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx Configuration**: Since a specific part of the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`) was directly referenced, it might be beneficial to examine it for any settings related to `napoleon` or `autodoc` that might influence the behavior described in the issue. However, I understand from the initial set of API capabilities provided that there's not a direct method to search configuration files by name.\n\n2. **Broader Search for Usage Patterns**: Given the limitations in directly accessing a specified file or configuration, a broader strategy might involve searching for usage patterns of `attrs` and `dataclasses` across the project to understand if there's a common pattern or issue in how attributes are documented. Unfortunately, without more specific class or method names mentioned in the issue, a targeted search is challenging.\n\n3. **Focus on `attr.s` and `dataclass` Decorators**: Since the issue specifically mentions problems arising with attributes defined through `attr.s` and `dataclasses`, searching for these decorators across the project could provide insight. However, the initial search results indicated an inability to locate the specified source file, and a broader search across the codebase might not be viable without corresponding API support for such broad searches.\n\nGiven the limitations encountered and the APIs available, a more fruitful approach might not be feasible without additional capabilities or adjustments to the search parameters. Specifically, without the ability to search across the entire project for patterns or file contents not explicitly named, or to correct the file path discrepancy, further context-specific investigation is limited.\n\nIn summary, the challenge hinges on the lack of access to specific project files as mentioned in the issue, and without the means to broadly search or correct for possible file path discrepancies, collecting additional context is constrained. For moving forward, it might be necessary to either adjust the search to focus on any available project files or components related to Sphinx documentation, `attrs`, and `dataclasses` in a broader sense, or to acquire more precise file paths or project structure details that would enable targeted searches."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

However, based on the description of the issue, we can theorize about the general area of concern and the intended behavior that would address the reported problem:\n\n### Theoretical Bug Location(s) and Intended Behavior:\n\n**1. Buggy Location:**\n- **File:** Likely within configuration files related to Sphinx, such as `conf.py`, or in a Sphinx extension if customizations were attempted.\n- **Module/Extension:** Sphinx's `autodoc` or `napoleon` extensions configuration.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- Modify or enhance the Sphinx configuration to ensure that `napoleon` or `autodoc` extracts and displays the type hint information from class attributes correctly, merging documentation comments with type annotations to avoid duplication. This may involve adjusting settings in the `conf.py` file, such as `napoleon_use_ivar=True` or exploring ways to customize or extend the behavior of `napoleon` to handle annotated attributes as described.\n  \n**2. Buggy Location:**\n- **Files/Classes/Methods:** Specific classes that utilize `attr.s` or `dataclasses.dataclass` decorators for attribute definition and are documented following the Google style guide.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- Ensure that for each attribute within these classes, the documentation generated correctly combines type hint information from the annotations with the descriptive text in the docstring, avoiding duplication. This might not involve changing the code itself but ensuring the documentation tools handle the existing structure correctly.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\nWhile the above outlines a theoretical approach to what might need to be addressed, without direct access to the specific files or project structure, such as the Sphinx configuration in `conf.py` or the exact implementation within classes using `attr.s` or `@dataclass`, these remain speculative solutions.\n\nTo adequately resolve the issue, access to the specific configurations, class implementations, and an understanding of the current Sphinx setup within the project would be essential. This would enable precise identification of code locations that might need to be patched and the development of a detailed approach to correct the documentation generation process as per the requirements noted in the issue."
