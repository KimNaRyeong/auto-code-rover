[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style
Following [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.

When generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.

While it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.

It would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.

This might be related to #7582  and #4074 .
