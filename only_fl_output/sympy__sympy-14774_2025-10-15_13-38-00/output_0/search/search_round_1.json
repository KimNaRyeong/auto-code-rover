        "content": "From the collected context, we can derive insights and connections to the reported issue:\n\n### Analysis of `_print_Function` in `latex.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The snippet around line 743 within the `_print_Function` method in `latex.py` defines an `inv_trig_table` list that includes shorthand notations for inverse trigonometric functions: \"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", and \"acot\". These are presumably used to check if a given function should be printed in an abbreviated or full form, depending on the `inv_trig_style` setting.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The bug report indicates that `acsc` and `asec` do not return their full names when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified, unlike other inverse trig functions like `asin(x)`. Since `acsc` and `asec` are not present in the `inv_trig_table`, this absence likely prevents the code from recognizing these as functions that can have a full name, resulting in the default `\\\\operatorname{acsc}` and `\\\\operatorname{asec}` instead of the expected `\\\\arccsc` and `\\\\arcsec`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would be for the `latex` function to recognize `acsc` and `asec` as inverse trigonometric functions that have both abbreviated and full representations. When `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified, it should return `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` and `\\\\arcsec{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` respectively for `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` and `latex(asec(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")`. To support this, `acsc` and `asec` need to be added to the `inv_trig_table`.\n\n### Analysis of `latex` Function in `latex.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `latex` function serves as the entry point for converting SymPy expressions to their LaTeX string representations. It details various settings that influence the latex printing, including `inv_trig_style` which controls how inverse trigonometric functions are formatted. This function delegates the actual printing logic to the `LatexPrinter` class, passing along the settings provided by the user.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   While this function itself does not directly implement the logic for rendering inverse trigonometric functions, it's pivotal for understanding how settings like `inv_trig_style` are passed to and interpreted by the `LatexPrinter`. Thus, it's key in ensuring the bug fix respects user preferences regarding function representation.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   While this function properly sets up and passes settings, including `inv_trig_style`, its behavior points to the necessity of ensuring that the `LatexPrinter` (specifically its `_print_Function` method) fully respects these settings for all inverse trigonometric functions, including `acsc` and `asec`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe logical step forward involves modifying the `inv_trig_table` within `latex.py` to include `acsc` and `asec` as part of the fix for this issue. This adjustment aligns the behavior of `latex` with the expectations set forth in the issue description for all inverse trigonometric functions when rendered with the \"full\" style, completing the bridge between user-specified settings and the actual output provided by SymPy's LaTeX printing functionality."

This means extending the `inv_trig_table` list on line 743 to include `\"acsc\"` and `\"asec\"`, making it `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\", \"acsc\", \"asec\"]`. This modification will ensure that when `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` or `latex(asec(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` is called, the output will be `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` and `\\\\arcsec{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` respectively, aligning with the full name printing style of other inverse trigonometric functions. This update preserves the existing functionality, allowing both the abbreviated and full styles to be accurately applied to all relevant functions, thereby fixing the issue described."
