Creating a standalone script that replicates a database migration issue specific to a Django project requires an approach that simulates Django's behavior as closely as possible, without access to an actual Django project's structure. This means setting up models, initiating Django's settings, and triggering migration-like operations manually within the script. This setup can allude to the issue, although accurately emulating Django's migration system in a script has its limitations.

The goal here will involve:
- Configuring Django settings within the script to avoid early `ImproperlyConfigured` errors.
- Simulating the creation of two models with the same name in different apps, akin to the initial issue setup.
- Attempting a model renaming operation to mimic the `RenameModel` migration step that leads to failure.

Here's how one could try to approximate this process:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, migrations
from django.core.management.color import no_style
from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor
from django.db.migrations.state import ProjectState
from django.db.migrations.autodetector import MigrationAutodetector
from django.db.migrations.operations import RenameModel
from django.apps.registry import Apps

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup Django environment and configuration
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    BASE_DIR=BASE_DIR,
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.admin',
    ],
    TIME_ZONE='UTC',
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define temporary Django model within custom app registry
class TemporaryModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'temp_app'  # This simulates defining the model in one application

# Simulate renaming model operation akin to Django migration system
try:
    # Custom apps registry to simulate the application context
    apps = Apps(['temp_app'])

    # Define the starting state
    starting_state = ProjectState.from_apps(apps)
    
    # Attempt to rename the model, simulating a migration operation
    operation = RenameModel('TemporaryModel', 'RenamedModel')
    operation.state_forwards('temp_app', starting_state)

    # Normally, at this point, migration operations would be applied to the database, which might trigger errors
    
    # If no exceptions have occurred up to this point, the simulated issue has not occurred
    print("Simulated issue did NOT occur, no AssertionError.")
except Exception as e:
    # If an exception is caught, report and exit with an error to indicate reproduction of the issue
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("Simulated migration issue detected.")
```

This script aims to encapsulate and illustrate the process described in the original problem. Note that this is a simplification. Genuine database migrations involve more intricate steps and interactions that this script does not fully replicate. For instance, running actual migrations entails altering database schemas which isn't directly attempted here. The script primarily focuses on the renaming operation's logical simulation within Django's migration framework assumptions.

In real applications, triggering specific transactional errors or database alteration issues usually requires interacting with the actual database through Django's ORM and migration files. Hence, while this script attempts to approach the outlined problem, reproducing database-level intricacies and migration conflicts accurately within a standalone script remains challenging.
