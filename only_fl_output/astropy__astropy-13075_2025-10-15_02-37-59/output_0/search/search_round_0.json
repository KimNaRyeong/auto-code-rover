        "content": "To address the issue, let's perform the following search API calls to gather more context about how the Cosmology class interacts with I/O mechanisms, especially regarding writing to files, and also to understand how the `def_unit` method integrates the `format` argument which can then be applied to the MathJax representation in the proposed feature:\n\n1. Search for the `Cosmology` class to get an overview and locate the relevant file(s): `search_class(\"Cosmology\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the `write` method and proposes a new `write_html` method, look for the `write` method within the `Cosmology` class to understand its current implementation: `search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"Cosmology\")`\n\n3. To gather more information on how the `to_table` method might be used with `Cosmology`, it's important to find its current implementation or reference: `search_method(\"to_table\")`\n\n4. Given that `QTable.write` is mentioned for writing the formatted table to HTML, investigate how this method is currently implemented to ensure compatibility with the proposed feature: `search_method(\"write\")`\n\n5. The issue suggests that MathJax representation of each parameter should be stored similar to how units' `format` argument is stored in `def_unit`. Investigating `def_unit` could provide insights on implementing the suggested feature: `search_method(\"def_unit\")`\n\nThese API calls will help in understanding how the `Cosmology.write` method functions, how tables are currently created and manipulated within the Astropy Cosmology module, and the method of implementing formatting options for units, which can serve as an analogy for implementing the MathJax formatting."
