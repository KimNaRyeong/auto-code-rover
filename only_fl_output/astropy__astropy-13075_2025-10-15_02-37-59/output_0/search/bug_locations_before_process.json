        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new `write_html` method (or equivalent that fits within Astropy's naming and design conventions) for the `Cosmology` class. This method should: 1. Utilize the `to_table` method or functionality to convert a `Cosmology` instance into a table format. 2. Format the table to HTML, ensuring that mathematical expressions are converted to MathJax format where appropriate, likely leveraging the `parameter.format` attribute proposed in the issue. 3. Register this new `write` method with the Astropy I/O system to handle the `html` format specifically for `Cosmology` objects, using `register_writer` in `astropy/io/registry/core.py`."
