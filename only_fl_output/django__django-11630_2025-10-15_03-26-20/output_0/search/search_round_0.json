We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.\nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name, we need to get more details about how the models are defined across the base app and other conflicting apps. Specifically, we should look into the model definitions that share the same `db_table` value across different apps, and also understand how database routing or multi-database setup is configured, as this might be a key factor in resolving the issue.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. We need to see how the models are defined in the `base` app and any other app (`app2` as mentioned in the issue) that might be causing the conflict. Since we don't have file names, let's search for the class definitions across the entire codebase:\n   - `search_class(\"ModelName\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue mentions a setup where different apps talk to their own databases, it's likely there is some database routing logic implemented. Let's search for any database routers or settings that specify database configurations. Typically, in Django, this could be configured in a file named `settings.py` or `databases.py`, or a custom router might be implemented. We can start by looking for known method names that are involved in database routing, such as `db_for_read` or `db_for_write`, and any explicit db_table configurations in the model classes. Since we don't have specific filenames or class names for routers, let's perform a broader search:\n   - `search_method(\"db_for_read\")`\n   - `search_method(\"db_for_write\")`\n   - `search_code(\"db_table\")`\n\nThese searches should provide insight into how the models are defined with respect to their table names, and how the application handles database routing, which could be relevant for solving the conflict of table names across different apps."
