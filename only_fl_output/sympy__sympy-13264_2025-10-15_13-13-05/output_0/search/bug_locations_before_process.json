        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method should be enhanced to support an optional recursive simplification mode, governed by a new parameter `max_rec_steps`, which defaults to 0 for backward compatibility. When `max_rec_steps` is greater than 0, the method should recursively reapply simplification to its own result, decrementing `max_rec_steps` with each recursion, until either no further simplification is achieved or `max_rec_steps` reaches 0. This recursion should: - Be carefully designed to avoid excessive performance penalties, particularly for large expressions or in cases where recursive simplification yields negligible benefits. - Apply a mechanism to detect and prevent simplification loops where the same set of expressions are cyclically simplified without convergence. - Ensure that the default operation (`max_rec_steps=0`) matches the current behavior to preserve existing functionality for current users of the `simplify` function. This modification addresses the issue by enabling `simplify` to perform more thorough simplification in cases where multiple passes are necessary to reach the simplest form, as described by the issue submitter."
