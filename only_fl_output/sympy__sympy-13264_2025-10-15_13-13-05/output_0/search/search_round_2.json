Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

The `simplify` method appears across multiple files in the SymPy codebase, indicating its widespread use and importance in different contexts, such as logic, vector operations, matrix operations, physics, special functions, core expressions, and polynomial domains. The presence of `simplify` in these diverse files suggests it's a core utility function used for expression simplification across different mathematical domains in SymPy.\n\n2. The specific search for the modified version of the `simplify` method, as suggested by the issue submitter, yielded no results. This indicates that the current implementation of `simplify` in the codebase does not yet include the suggested parameters (`ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0`). The absence implies that the proposed enhancement or bug fix, which involves adding an optional recursive mode controlled by `max_rec_steps`, has not been implemented.\n\nGiven these outcomes, the next steps should focus on obtaining the current implementation details of the `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, as it's likely the central implementation affecting the reported issue. This can help answer the following questions based on the issue description:\n\n1. **Current Implementation and Behavior**: What is the current signature and implementation of `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`? Understanding this will clarify how it operates now and what strategies it employs for simplification.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: Since the issue implies that `simplify` does not fully factorize expressions on the first call but does so upon a second call, examining the existing logic will reveal why some simplification strategies might only apply or fully succeed after an initial simplification pass. This relates to the recursive enhancement proposed by the submitter.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `simplify` should be capable of recognizing when further simplification is possible and performing it in a single call. The issue suggests that by allowing a recursive simplification mode, where `simplify` can be applied again based on a measure of the expression's complexity (`measure` function) and a predefined `max_rec_steps`, the function would more thoroughly simplify expressions upon a single invocation.\n\nTo proceed, focusing on the implementation in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is essential. Therefore, the necessary API calls would include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")`: to retrieve the details of `simplify`'s implementation.\n- Optionally, understanding how `measure` and `shorter` functions are defined and used could also be insightful, requiring additional searches if they are not part of the `simplify` method's implementation details. This would entail calling `search_method(\"measure\")` and `search_method(\"shorter\")`, but let's first focus on the `simplify` method itself."

If\n391     your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n392     determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n393     together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n394     function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n395     will be robust.\n396 \n397     Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n398     anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n399     intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n400     example:\n401 \n402     >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n403     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n404     >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n405     >>> a\n406     (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n407     >>> simplify(a)\n408     x + 1\n409 \n410     Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n411     simplification functions:\n412 \n413     >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n414     >>> trigsimp(a)\n415     (x**2 + x)/x\n416     >>> cancel(_)\n417     x + 1\n418 \n419     In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n420     complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n421     cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n422     unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n423     to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n424     single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n425     expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n426     ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n427     :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n428     expression.\n429 \n430     For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n431     than input.\n432 \n433     ::\n434 \n435         >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n436         >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n437 \n438     Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n439     root is returned unchanged instead::\n440 \n441        >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n442        True\n443 \n444     If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n445 \n446         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n447         True\n448 \n449     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n450     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n451     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n452     choice.\n453 \n454     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n455     should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n456     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n457     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n458     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n459     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n460     one.\n461 \n462     For example:\n463 \n464     >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n465     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n466     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n467     >>> h = simplify(g)\n468     >>> h\n469     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n470     >>> count_ops(g)\n471     8\n472     >>> count_ops(h)\n473     5\n474 \n475     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n476     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n477     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n478     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n479     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n480 \n481     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n482     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n483     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n484     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n485 \n486     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n487     >>> def my_measure(expr):\n488     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n489     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n490     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n491     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n492     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n493     ...     return count\n494     >>> my_measure(g)\n495     8\n496     >>> my_measure(h)\n497     14\n498     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n499     True\n500     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n501     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n502 \n503     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n504     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n505     function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n506     from the input expression by doing this.\n507     \"\"\"\n508     expr = sympify(expr)\n509 \n510     try:\n511         return expr._eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure)\n512     except AttributeError:\n513         pass\n514 \n515     original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n516 \n517     from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n518     from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n519     from sympy import Sum, Product\n520 \n521     if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n522         return expr\n523 \n524     if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n525         if isinstance(expr, Function) and hasattr(expr, \"inverse\"):\n526             if len(expr.args) == 1 and len(expr.args[0].args) == 1 and \\\n527                isinstance(expr.args[0], expr.inverse(argindex=1)):\n528                 return simplify(expr.args[0].args[0], ratio=ratio,\n529                                 measure=measure, fu=fu)\n530         return expr.func(*[simplify(x, ratio=ratio, measure=measure, fu=fu)\n531                          for x in expr.args])\n532 \n533     # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n534     # is it a purely rational function?

It accepts an expression and optional arguments specifying the simplification ratio, a measure function to determine expression complexity, and a flag for further unspecified utilities (`fu`). The function attempts to apply a series of transformations and simplifications to reduce the complexity of the given expression while considering the stated constraints (e.g., the `ratio` parameter).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The reported bug is that calling `simplify` on certain expressions does not perform the final possible simplification step unless `simplify` is invoked again on the result. This indicates that, for some expressions, the initial call to `simplify` leaves the expression in a state that could be further simplified but isn't due to the current algorithm's limitations or the order in which various simplification strategies are applied.\n   \n   The provided code snippet does not currently attempt any form of recursion or reapplication of simplification strategies based on the results of initial passes. This aligns with the issue description, suggesting that an improvement could be to integrate a mechanism for additional simplification attempts when deemed beneficial, controlled by an additional parameter like `max_rec_steps`, as suggested by the issue's author.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior, to resolve the issue, would involve enhancing the `simplify` function to support recursive application, allowing it to reapply itself to the result of each simplification attempt up to a specified maximum number of recursive steps (`max_rec_steps`). This enhancement would enable the function to potentially catch and perform further simplifications that the current single-pass approach misses. \n\n   To preserve the existing functionality of the code while addressing the issue, any changes should default to the current behavior (i.e., non-recursive operation unless explicitly requested via the new parameter). This ensures backward compatibility for existing code relying on `simplify`.\n\nThus, the necessary enhancement to the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file and specifically to the `simplify` method would involve:\n- Adding a new parameter `max_rec_steps=0` to the function definition to control the maximum number of recursive simplification steps.\n- Implementing a recursive mechanism within the function that allows it to reapply itself, considering the new parameter, ensuring that the recursion depth does not exceed `max_rec_steps`.\n- Ensuring that this new feature does not negatively impact performance for cases where recursive simplification is not necessary or desired."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

When `max_rec_steps` is greater than 0, the method should recursively reapply simplification to its own result, decrementing `max_rec_steps` with each recursion, until either no further simplification is achieved or `max_rec_steps` reaches 0. \n\n   This recursion should:\n   - Be carefully designed to avoid excessive performance penalties, particularly for large expressions or in cases where recursive simplification yields negligible benefits.\n   - Apply a mechanism to detect and prevent simplification loops where the same set of expressions are cyclically simplified without convergence.\n   - Ensure that the default operation (`max_rec_steps=0`) matches the current behavior to preserve existing functionality for current users of the `simplify` function.\n\n   This modification addresses the issue by enabling `simplify` to perform more thorough simplification in cases where multiple passes are necessary to reach the simplest form, as described by the issue submitter."
