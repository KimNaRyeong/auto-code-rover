Given the requirements and the previous attempt's outcome, it appears there was a misunderstanding in executing the test that should reproduce the in-place addition issue with xarray DataArrays having differently ordered coordinates. Let's construct a modified version of `reproducer.py` that aims to accurately replicate the described problem, including a proper environment validation which should prevent unexpected exits due to package version incompatibilities, as seen with numpy. 

Here's the updated version:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_environment():
    import xarray
    import numpy

    # Verify xarray version to be relevant for this test
    xr_version = xarray.__version__
    major, minor, *_ = map(int, xr_version.split('.'))
    if major < 1 or (major == 0 and minor < 15):
        print(f"Error: Detected xarray version {xr_version} is too old for this test.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Verify numpy version for compatibility
    np_version = numpy.__version__
    major, minor, *_ = map(int, np_version.split('.'))
    if major > 1:
        print(f"Error: Detected numpy version {np_version} indicates an incompatible future version.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

def try_inplace_addition():
    import numpy as np
    import xarray as xr

    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        A += B
        print("In-place addition succeeded without error.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed with an error") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_environment()
    try_inplace_addition()
```

This revised edition introduces a preliminary environment verification step (`verify_environment`) to ensure that the execution environment meets the required conditions (in terms of both xarray and numpy versions) for the specific test case. This approach aims to mitigate potential discrepancies arising from the use of incompatible package versions, as highlighted in the earlier fails. Upon ensuring environmental compatibility, the script proceeds with the in-place addition test, retaining the use of the `print_stacktrace` functionality to handle and display exceptions meaningfully.
