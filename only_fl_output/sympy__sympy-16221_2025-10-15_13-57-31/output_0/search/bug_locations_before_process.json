        "intended_behavior": "This location requires the implementation or enhancement of a method responsible for handling the printing of matrices and arrays in the Mathematica format. The method should detect when the input object is a matrix or array and format it according to Mathematica's expectations for such data structures. This includes wrapping matrices in `MatrixForm` or an equivalent function and maintaining compatibility with existing print functionality for other types. The code should be designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing printing framework, possibly by extending existing classes or methods tailored for Mathematica output. The implementation must preserve the current capabilities of the module, ensuring that the addition of matrices and arrays does not disrupt the handling of other Mathematica expressions."
