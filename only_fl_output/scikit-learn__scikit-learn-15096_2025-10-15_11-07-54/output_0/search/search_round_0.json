I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context to address the issue mentioned, I will perform the following search API calls based on the details provided:\n\n1. The issue revolves around `GridSearchCV`, specifically its behavior when `n_jobs = 1`. Therefore, it's essential to find where `GridSearchCV` is defined in the codebase. I'll start by searching for the `GridSearchCV` class.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that `cv_results_['params']` and all `cv_results_['param_*']` objects contain fitted estimators, particularly concerning memory usage when these are dumped, I need to find where `cv_results_` is populated. I'll search for methods within `GridSearchCV` that deal with updating or assigning values to `cv_results_`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"cv_results_\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n3. The user suspects that the bug occurs because the estimators are not cloned before use. Cloning of estimators is a common practice in scikit-learn to ensure that the original estimators passed to grid search are not modified during the fitting process. Therefore, it is crucial to find where and how estimators are cloned within the `GridSearchCV` process. I'll search for the usage of the `clone` function or method within the context of `GridSearchCV`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"clone\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n4. It's also valuable to understand how the `fit` method of `GridSearchCV` operates since the fitting process involves the estimators that the issue points out. By examining the `fit` method, we can better understand how estimators are handled during the grid search.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive code context around the handling of estimators within `GridSearchCV`, specifically related to cloning, memory usage, and the population of `cv_results_`. This information will be pivotal in crafting a solution."
