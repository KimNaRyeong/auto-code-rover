        "intended_behavior": "The fit method (or a sub-method responsible for handling estimators) should ensure that when parameter grids include estimator objects, these are cloned before fitting to avoid storing fitted estimator instances within cv_results_. This would prevent unnecessary memory use and ensure that cv_results_ only stores unfitted estimators or, preferably, their parameters rather than fitted instances. Cloning should be employed consistently to preserve the original state of passed estimators, maintaining functionality while preventing side effects on memory and disk usage when dumping cv_results_. The implementation needs to verify if deep cloning of estimator parameters is performed when these are set in the param grid, ensuring that the state of these objects post-fit does not affect the dumped results. This would likely involve inspecting and possibly adjusting the internal logic of parameter handling and result logging within the grid search process, specifically tailored to handle cases where n_jobs = 1."
