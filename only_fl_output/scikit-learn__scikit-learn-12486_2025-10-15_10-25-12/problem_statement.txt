#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
We are fixing this issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7598
We added a test in the scorer.py file that raises a ValueError if the user is either trying to use a non classifier model for a classification problem, or is using a dataset with only one class. 

#### Any other comments?

BUG: Using GridSearchCV with scoring='roc_auc' and GMM as classifier gives IndexError
When performing grid search using GridSearchCV using ootb scoring method 'roc_auc' and ootb GMM classifier from sklearn.mixture.GMM I get an index error.
Code to reproduce:

```
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.mixture import GMM
X,y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples = 10000, n_features=10,n_classes=2)
# Vanilla GMM_model
gmm_model = GMM()
# Standard param grid
param_grid = {'n_components' : [1,2,3,4],
              'covariance_type': ['tied','full','spherical']}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')
# Fit GS with this data
grid_search.fit(X, y)
```

Sorry if the format is incorrect. First time I am posting.

ERROR:
  File "*/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/scorer.py", line 175, in **call**
    y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]
IndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1
