        "intended_behavior": "This method should include a validation check to ensure that the shape of `y_pred` conforms to expectations for binary classification tasks before attempting to index it. When `y_pred` does not have at least two columns (for binary classifiers), a descriptive error should be raised informing the user about the mismatch. This preserves the method's functionality while providing clearer guidance when used with models that do not produce binary classification-compatible outputs."

        "method": "__call__",
        "intended_behavior": "Similarly to `_ProbaScorer`, the `_ThresholdScorer` method should verify `y_pred`'s structure before indexing into it, ensuring it is compatible with binary classifiers' expected output format. If `y_pred` does not meet these criteria, the method should raise a descriptive error explaining the incompatibility, rather than failing with an `IndexError`. This change aims to make the error more understandable to the user and guide them towards appropriate usage of the model evaluation workflow with `GridSearchCV`."
