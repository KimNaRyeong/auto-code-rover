Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to find where in the codebase the `__isnull` lookup is being handled. This involves identifying the relevant classes or methods where the validation of `__isnull` values occurs or should occur. Here are the steps and corresponding API calls we could make to gather the needed context:\n\n1. Since `__isnull` is most likely part of a query interface or a model query parameter in a web framework (like Django), we need to locate its handling mechanism. We might start by looking for methods or classes related to query processing.\n\n2. The name `__isnull` suggests it's used with field lookups or query annotations, so we're looking for query-related classes or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) utilities.\n\nGiven the above, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"__isnull\")`: This will help identify if there's a dedicated method handling `__isnull` directly in the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"__isnull\")`: Since `__isnull` might not be a standalone method but part of larger query construction or validation logic, searching for the code snippet itself can lead us to the right locations in the project where it's being handled or parsed.\n\nThese calls are aimed at pinpointing the exact implementation or validation locations for `__isnull`, which we can then examine to understand where and how to introduce error-raising for non-boolean values."
