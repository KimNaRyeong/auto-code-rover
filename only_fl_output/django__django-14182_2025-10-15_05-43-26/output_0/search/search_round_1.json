        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls gives us some insights into how the issue might be approached and what modifications may be needed.\n\n### Analysis of the `Round` Class\n\nThe `Round` class is a subclass of `Transform`, with the `function` attribute set to `'ROUND'` and a `lookup_name` of `'round'`. This class is defined within `django/db/models/functions/math.py`, indicating it's a part of Django's ORM system for performing database operations.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThis part of the code defines a transformation function that Django can use to translate Python code into the SQL needed to round numerical values stored in the database. Since it inherits from `Transform`, it\u2019s designed to be used in query expressions to manipulate database fields directly in queries.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nThe issue points out that the `Round` function currently does not support a precision argument. Given the collected code snippet, it's clear that the `Round` class lacks any parameters for specifying precision when rounding. This is directly related to the issue as it highlights that the ability to specify precision would need to be added to this class.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the `Round` class to support an optional precision argument that allows users to specify how many decimal places to round to. This aligns with the request to enhance the functionality to be closer to what is natively supported by the underlying database backends (Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle).\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nSince the attempt to search for a method named `arity` within the `Round` class returned no results, it indicates that specifying the number of arguments (arity) directly in the class is not the current practice for this function. This could mean the class does not explicitly define or limit the number of arguments that can be passed to the database function.\n\nGiven that the search for the `function = 'ROUND'` code snippet only pointed to the previous discovery in `math.py`, the next step in understanding how to add the precision functionality involves looking at either how Django's `Transform` class handles arguments or exploring how arguments are passed to the underlying database function within Django's ORM framework.\n\nTo proceed, the following API calls could provide more context:\n\n1. **Investigate How Transform Classes Handle Arguments**:\n   To understand if there's a mechanism in place for handling additional arguments (like precision), examining the base `Transform` class may reveal relevant methods or patterns.\n   \n   ```\n   search_class(\"Transform\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Look for Method Invocations Within `Round`**:\n   Since there wasn't a direct hit for a method named `arity`, it might be useful to get a broader view of the `Round` class's code to identify how it\u2019s built and if there's any custom logic for handling function calls.\n   \n   ```\n   get_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/functions/math.py\", 162, 10)\n   ```\n\nThese steps should provide a clearer path towards implementing support for a precision argument within the `Round` function."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

This entails modifying the `Round` class definition to accept a precision parameter and propagate this parameter to the underlying SQL function call. The existing functionality, where calling the `Round` function without a precision argument defaults to rounding to the nearest integer, must be preserved. \n\n    A possible approach would involve extending the `__init__` method of the `Round` class to accept an additional argument, `precision=None`, and updating the logic that constructs the SQL query to include this precision argument when it is provided by the user. Care should be taken to ensure that this change is compatible with all database backends supported by Django, as mentioned in the issue description. This enhancement would allow Django developers to specify the number of decimal places to which a number should be rounded directly within their ORM queries, improving the versatility and utility of the `Round` function."
