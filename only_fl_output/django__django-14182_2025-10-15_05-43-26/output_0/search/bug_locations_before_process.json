        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `Round` class needs to be enhanced to support an optional precision argument. This entails modifying the `Round` class definition to accept a precision parameter and propagate this parameter to the underlying SQL function call. The existing functionality, where calling the `Round` function without a precision argument defaults to rounding to the nearest integer, must be preserved. A possible approach would involve extending the `__init__` method of the `Round` class to accept an additional argument, `precision=None`, and updating the logic that constructs the SQL query to include this precision argument when it is provided by the user. Care should be taken to ensure that this change is compatible with all database backends supported by Django, as mentioned in the issue description. This enhancement would allow Django developers to specify the number of decimal places to which a number should be rounded directly within their ORM queries, improving the versatility and utility of the `Round` function."
