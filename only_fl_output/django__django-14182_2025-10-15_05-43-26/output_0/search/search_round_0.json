If you need to round to a more specific precision you need to roll out your own solution.\nBut as far as I can tell, all backends natively supported by Django support a second argument to Round:\nPostgres: \u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-math.html#FUNCTIONS-MATH-FUNC-TABLE\nSqlite: \u200bhttps://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#round\nMySQL: \u200bhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mathematical-functions.html#function_round\nOracle: \u200bhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions135.htm\nIn my project (postgres only) my work around was to declare my own custom function:\nclass Round(Func):\nfunction = 'ROUND'\narity = 2\nBut having this built-in would be quite useful.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather the necessary context for adding precision argument support to the Round function, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `Round` class in the codebase to understand how it is currently implemented and see if there's a place where a precision argument could be easily added.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Round\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the user created their own workaround by defining a custom `Round` function, it would be helpful to search for where this `Round` function might be getting used or how similar functions are defined across the project. This might give insight into adding a new argument to the function signature.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"function = 'ROUND'\")\n   ```\n\n3. Additionally, it's beneficial to look for any existing methods related to the `Round` function, especially those that handle its parameters or could be involved in processing a precision argument.\n\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"arity\", \"Round\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide a good starting point for understanding how rounding is currently implemented across different database backends in the project and where modifications are necessary to support precision rounding."
