        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue about the `makemessages` command skipping the `nl-nl-x-informal` folder due to a locale validation problem, we need to focus on several areas:\n\n1. **DjangoTranslation class** - It's mentioned that this class uses the `to_locale` method correctly for the conversion, which implies we should understand how `to_locale` works and where it's implemented.\n2. **makemessages command** - Specifically, we need to examine how makemessages processes locales and why it might reject `nl_NL-x-informal`.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `DjangoTranslation` class to find its implementation and usage of `to_locale` method.\n2. Search for the `makemessages` command logic, which might be a function or part of a class, to understand its validation process for locales.\n3. Explore the `to_locale` method used by `DjangoTranslation`.\n4. Since the issue mentioned a specific commit, examining code around the introduced behavior would be beneficial. However, given the tool's constraints, direct examination of a commit's contents isn't possible, so we focus on the relevant functions or classes that might be influenced by that commit.\n\nLet's make the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"DjangoTranslation\")`\n- `search_method(\"to_locale\")`\n- `search_code(\"makemessages\")`"
