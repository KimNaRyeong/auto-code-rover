Certainly! Here's how you can create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` for reproducing the described issue. This script checks if the complement operation works as expected when the input is a combination of symbols and numbers. If the behaviour deviates from the expectation, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

```python
from sympy import Symbol, FiniteSet, Interval, Complement
from sympy.abc import x, y

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_complement_with_symbols_and_numbers():
    a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
    b = Interval(-10, 10)
    try:
        result = Complement(a, b)
        # Check for the expected output
        # The expected behavior is that the complement {x, y, 2} \ [-10, 10]
        # would include the symbols and the number that are not in the interval,
        # so the correct output here would indeed be something that represents
        # {x, y} since 2 is in the interval [-10, 10], but the symbols x, y are
        # not numerically bounded. However, the precise expected result is subject
        # to the interpretation of how symbolic elements should be handled in
        # set operations with numerical intervals.
        # The described issue implies we're expecting {x, y} \ [-10,10] as output
        # hence asserting result is not simply {x, y} as FiniteSet might suggest it.
        assert str(result) == "{x, y} \\ Interval(-10, 10)", "Complement does not match the expected output {x, y} \\ [-10,10]"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise the AssertionError after printing stacktrace

try:
    test_complement_with_symbols_and_numbers()
except AssertionError:
    pass  # If an AssertionError is raised, it has been caught and handled by print_stacktrace.
else:
    print("The issue has been fixed.")

```

This script focuses on the specific behavior of the complement operation involving symbolic and numerical elements. It asserts the expected behavior and prints detailed information about any deviations, facilitating debugging. Note that the issue resolution might involve adjusting the expectation based on the symbolic math library's (Sympy, in this case) design and handling of such cases.
