This means adjusting the logic to not just handle numeric elements and their intervals in relation to the other set but also to explicitly include any symbols in the FiniteSet in the final complement output. The condition that checks for the presence of numeric elements (if other == S.Reals and nums != []) might need to be adapted or supplemented with logic that ensures symbols are handled correctly and explicitly included, not just as a byproduct of numeric handling."

        "method": "_complement",
        "intended_behavior": "While the method primarily focuses on numerical boundaries for intervals, it should also account for cases where the other set is a FiniteSet containing symbols. Specifically, when an interval's complement is computed against such a set, the result should recognize that symbols do not fall within numerical ranges and thus are part of the complemented set. An enhancement here should ensure that complement operations involving FiniteSets with symbols yield a result that accurately reflects the symbols as part of the complement, particularly by refining the handling in cases like if isinstance(other, FiniteSet): to ensure symbols are explicitly considered and included in the output."
