This class has methods like `_complement`, `_union`, `_intersect`, etc., which are typical set operations. The issue involves the `_complement` operation when a `FiniteSet` interacts with an `Interval`.\n\n2. **Interval:** Represents a continuous interval on the real line. It also has similar set operations methods, including `_complement`. An `Interval` can be open or closed at either end, determined by the `left_open` and `right_open` properties.\n\n3. **Complement Functionality:** The issue reported cannot be directly linked to a method named `Complement` since such a method wasn't found. This implies the operation might be facilitated through other mechanisms such as the `_complement` method in each class or through some overarching function that handles set operations by calling these class-specific methods.\n\n#### Relationship with the Issue\nThe reported bug indicates an issue with the complement operation (`Complement`) between a `FiniteSet` containing symbols and numbers and an `Interval`. Specifically, the expected behavior is to retain the symbols alongside the numerical complement calculation. \n\nGiven both classes support a `_complement` method, the issue likely arises from how these methods are implemented or how they are invoked in the context of a mixed-type set operation (symbols and real intervals).\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior appears to involve special handling when the `FiniteSet` and `Interval` are involved in a complement operation:\n- When performing a complement of a `FiniteSet` against an `Interval`, the output should exclude any elements from the `FiniteSet` that fall within the numerical range of the `Interval` but retain symbols and numbers outside the interval.\n- This suggests that the complement operation needs to be aware of the nature of elements within the `FiniteSet` (symbolic versus numerical) and handle them accordingly.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above analysis, further investigation is required in these areas:\n- **Implementation of the `_complement` methods** within both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` to understand their current handling of complements.\n- **Mechanism of dispatching** `Complement` operations to understand how the complement between a `FiniteSet` and an `Interval` is computed, particularly in the absence of a direct `Complement` method.\n\nTo advance the investigation, I'll need to examine the implementations of the `_complement` methods within both classes. This will help understand the existing logic and identify where adjustments are needed to accommodate the expected behavior with mixed symbolic and numerical elements.\n\n#### Required API Calls for Further Investigation\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_complement\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_complement\", \"Interval\")`"

Specifically, it should ensure that when calculating the complement of `FiniteSet` with an `Interval`, symbols are retained in the output, signifying that they do not participate in the numerical range operation but are still part of the set's complement.\n\n    - **Bug Location 2:**\n        - **File:** `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n        - **Class:** `Interval`\n        - **Method:** `_complement`\n        - **Intended Behavior:** While the primary issue seems to be with how `FiniteSet` handles complements, it is also crucial to review the `_complement` method within the `Interval` class to ensure it correctly interacts with sets that contain a mix of symbols and numbers. The method should maintain existing functionality for numerical operations while correctly accounting for symbols as non-numerical entities that do not fall within any numerical range.\n\n    These are speculative bug locations and their intended behavior based on the initial analysis. A detailed review of the `_complement` methods' implementations is necessary to identify specific code sections that need to be modified."

It sorts numeric members, calculates intervals between these members, and, if there are symbols, includes them in the complement result.\n\n2. **Relationship to Bug:** The logic partially addresses the reported issue by attempting to handle symbols within a `FiniteSet` when calculating its complement against an interval. However, the issue seems to arise because the expected behavior\u2014retaining symbols in the result alongside calculated intervals\u2014may not function correctly under all circumstances. For example, the condition `if other == S.Reals and nums != []:` suggests that the handling is specific to when the `other` set is the entire set of reals. The bug might be related to the specific conditions under which symbols are included or excluded in the final complement.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior for `_complement` here would correctly handle the scenario where a `FiniteSet` contains both symbols and numbers. When complementing with an interval, the method should ensure symbols are preserved in the output, indicating that they remain part of the complemented set. This implies there may need to be an adjustment or expansion in the logic that specifically checks and retains symbols in the final output, regardless of the numeric content of the `FiniteSet` or the nature of the interval (whether it is `S.Reals` or a more restricted interval).\n\n#### Interval._complement Method\n1. **What It Does:** This method computes the complement of an interval, considering cases when `other` is the set of all reals and when it is a `FiniteSet`. It handles numeric elements within a `FiniteSet` but returns `None` if the `FiniteSet` does not contain numbers, indicating it does not currently handle symbol-only or mixed content well in complement calculations.\n\n2. **Relationship to Bug:** Although this method directly deals with finding the complement of an interval, its handling of cases involving `FiniteSet`s might not be comprehensive enough to account for situations where the `FiniteSet` includes symbolic elements. This could contribute to the overall issue if the methodology for identifying and retaining symbols during complement operations is not robust or if the operation does not account for symbol retention correctly.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** The method should be enhanced to ensure that when an interval's complement is taken against a `FiniteSet` containing symbols, the resulting set includes these symbols. This might involve adjusting or extending the logic to explicitly consider and retain symbols as part of the complement calculation, ensuring that symbols are not inadvertently excluded from the output.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth the `_complement` implementations in `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes appear to handle numeric and symbolic elements to some degree but might not fully support the expected behavior described in the issue. The solution may involve refining these methods to better discern and preserve symbols in complement operations involving a mix of numeric and symbolic elements within `FiniteSet` against `Interval` objects, ensuring symbols are consistently included in the result."
