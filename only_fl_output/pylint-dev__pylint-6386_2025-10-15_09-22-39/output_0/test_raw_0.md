This script attempts to reproduce the issue as described. It runs `pylint` with the `-v` option, expecting to trigger the specific error message about an argument being expected for the verbose option. If the error occurs, it captures the output, prints a stack trace detailing where the error was caught, and exits with a status code to indicate the presence of the bug. If the script executes without encountering the expected error, it suggests that the issue might have been resolved, exiting with a different status code to indicate a potentially fixed state.
