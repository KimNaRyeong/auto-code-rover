        "intended_behavior": "The constructor of the Float class, likely the __new__ method or a class method like _new, should be modified to clearly differentiate and accept both decimal (dps) and binary (prec) precision specifications explicitly. If both are specified, the method should trigger an error, advising the user that only one type of precision specification is allowed at a time. This ensures clarity and prevents misuse while maintaining backward compatibility, as much as possible, by introducing clear and distinct parameters for each type of precision. The code should also contain adequate documentation/comments about this behavior for future maintainers. This adjustment would resolve the current issue by aligning the naming and functionality with the conventions used across sympy and mpmath, where prec refers to binary precision and a new parameter dps (or use the already present one if applicable) refers to decimal precision."

        "intended_behavior": "Any method within the Float class that directly or indirectly interacts with the precision of a Float object, especially those involved in converting between binary and decimal precision or setting the _prec attribute, should be audited and possibly modified to ensure it correctly interprets and handles the distinction between prec and dps. This includes methods that might calculate, adjust, or infer precision based on provided inputs or existing attributes. This modification could involve adjusting how binary precision is calculated from decimal precision to ensure that it adheres to the proper interpretation of precision, whether binary or decimal, based on the newly enforced distinction."
