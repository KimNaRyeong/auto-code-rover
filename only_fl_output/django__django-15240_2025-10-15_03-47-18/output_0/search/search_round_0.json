        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue about deleting nonexistent migrations from the `django_migrations` table effectively, we need some specific pieces of information from the Django codebase. Specifically, we'll need to understand where and how Django interacts with the `django_migrations` table, the implementation of the migration mechanism, especially focusing on the `squashmigrations` command, the migrate command, and any mechanism that tracks and applies migrations. \n\nThe first step is to locate the parts of the Django codebase responsible for the functionality mentioned in the issue. Looking into how migrations are recorded and how the `django_migrations` table is updated will be crucial. Based on the description, the following API calls would be necessary to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. **Migration Application Mechanism**: To understand how migrations are applied and recorded in `django_migrations`.\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationRecorder\")`\n   - This is because Django uses a recorder to keep track of applied migrations, and this class likely interacts with the `django_migrations` table.\n\n2. **SquashMigrations Command**: To see how the squashing of migrations is handled.\n   - `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`\n   - Since the issue involves squashed migrations being reintroduced with conflicting names, understanding the implementation of `squashmigrations` could reveal insights on potential hooks for cleaning up the migrations table.\n\n3. **Migrate Command**: To explore how migration files are applied and how it could be enhanced to clean up the `django_migrations` table.\n   - `search_method(\"migrate\")`\n   - Enhancements or checks could be introduced in the `migrate` command process to ensure only existing migrations are considered applied.\n\n4. **Detection and Deletion of Nonexistent Migrations**: To find any existing mechanisms or places in code where a similar operation might be implemented or where the proposed feature could be integrated.\n   - `search_code(\"django_migrations\")`\n   - This will help us find direct references to the `django_migrations` table, providing insight into where and how it's manipulated throughout the Django codebase.\n\nThese calls will provide a broad spectrum of the code and mechanisms involved in migration application, tracking, and the specific issue of handling non-existent migrations post-squash. Understanding these mechanisms will be essential for crafting a solution to the issue described."
