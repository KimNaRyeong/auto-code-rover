        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue about deleting nonexistent migrations from the `django_migrations` table effectively, we need some specific pieces of information from the Django codebase. Specifically, we'll need to understand where and how Django interacts with the `django_migrations` table, the implementation of the migration mechanism, especially focusing on the `squashmigrations` command, the migrate command, and any mechanism that tracks and applies migrations. \n\nThe first step is to locate the parts of the Django codebase responsible for the functionality mentioned in the issue. Looking into how migrations are recorded and how the `django_migrations` table is updated will be crucial. Based on the description, the following API calls would be necessary to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. **Migration Application Mechanism**: To understand how migrations are applied and recorded in `django_migrations`.\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationRecorder\")`\n   - This is because Django uses a recorder to keep track of applied migrations, and this class likely interacts with the `django_migrations` table.\n\n2. **SquashMigrations Command**: To see how the squashing of migrations is handled.\n   - `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`\n   - Since the issue involves squashed migrations being reintroduced with conflicting names, understanding the implementation of `squashmigrations` could reveal insights on potential hooks for cleaning up the migrations table.\n\n3. **Migrate Command**: To explore how migration files are applied and how it could be enhanced to clean up the `django_migrations` table.\n   - `search_method(\"migrate\")`\n   - Enhancements or checks could be introduced in the `migrate` command process to ensure only existing migrations are considered applied.\n\n4. **Detection and Deletion of Nonexistent Migrations**: To find any existing mechanisms or places in code where a similar operation might be implemented or where the proposed feature could be integrated.\n   - `search_code(\"django_migrations\")`\n   - This will help us find direct references to the `django_migrations` table, providing insight into where and how it's manipulated throughout the Django codebase.\n\nThese calls will provide a broad spectrum of the code and mechanisms involved in migration application, tracking, and the specific issue of handling non-existent migrations post-squash. Understanding these mechanisms will be essential for crafting a solution to the issue described."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `MigrationRecorder` class is responsible for recording which migrations have been applied to the database. It facilitates tracking these through operations like determining if the migrations table (`django_migrations`) exists, creating a schema for it if necessary, recording migrations as applied or unapplied, and fetching the list of applied migrations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue at hand involves the `django_migrations` table potentially containing references to migrations that no longer exist after squashing. The `MigrationRecorder` class, by interacting with this table, is directly related to the issue. It is likely that any patch or mechanism designed to rectify or mitigate the issue would involve modifications or extensions to the functionality encapsulated by this class.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code, given the issue description:**\n   - Ideally, this class should include functionality to validate the records in the `django_migrations` table against the actual migration files present in the Django project. This would involve adding methods to detect and remove records of nonexistent migrations, ensuring that the table reflects only migrations that exist and can be applied.\n\n#### migrate method in django/db/migrations/executor.py\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `migrate` method orchestrates the migration process to the database up to specified targets. It checks if migrations need to be applied, ensures the migrations schema is up to date, calculates the migration plan, and then either applies all planned migrations forward, or, if necessary, reverts them.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method's logic includes ensuring the `django_migrations` table is in the correct state before and after applying migrations. Given the issue revolves around incorrect entries remaining in this table, there's a clear relationship. The method might need adjustments to include the validation of migration records against the file system, especially after a squash operation.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code, given the issue description:**\n   - To prevent the described issue, the `migrate` method could incorporate a step to clean up the `django_migrations` table, either before migrating or after, to ensure that only valid, extant migrations are considered applied. This step should intelligently handle squashed migrations, perhaps by consulting a new method in the `MigrationRecorder` that checks for the existence of the physical migration files.\n\n#### search_code(\"django_migrations\") findings\n\nThe code snippets containing references to `django_migrations` are located within both the `MigrationRecorder` class and the `migrate` method, indicating that these points in the codebase are where Django interacts with the migrations table. Given the issue, scrutiny of these interactions offers a clear path towards implementing a solution. The close involvement of these code areas with the reported bug means that enhancing them to account for the existence of migrations or the cleanup of legacy or squashed migrations is essential to the intended solution.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps in creating a patch would involve:\n\n- Proposing additional methods within the `MigrationRecorder` class to validate migration records against the file system.\n- Altering the `migrate` method logic to invoke this validation at appropriate times.\n- Developing a comprehensive strategy for safely identifying and handling squashed and deleted migrations without losing necessary historical data which might be crucial for rollbacks or audits.\n\nFurther, it might be worth exploring the documentation or trying to emit signals around migrations application to allow for custom handling or extensions by third-party packages or custom Django app code. This would provide developers with hooks to address similar issues in a more flexible manner."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

It might need to access the migration file directory to compare the list of migrations in the filesystem against those recorded in the database. Migrations listed in the database but not found in the file system should be handled appropriately, possibly with a mechanism to retain records of migrations that are intentionally \"squashed\" but still acknowledged by newer migration files.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: django/db/migrations/executor.py, Method: migrate\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Modify the `migrate` method to integrate a call to the newly proposed `MigrationRecorder.validate_migrations_existence` method at a strategic point before applying migrations. This adjustment ensures that the database's `django_migrations` table reflects only those migrations that are actively part of the project or are acknowledged by squashed migrations. Care must be taken to ensure this validation does not impede the squash migrations process or inadvertently remove historical data necessary for future rollbacks or audits.\n\nThese modifications carefully balance the need to clean up outdated migration records while preserving the integrity and historical tracking provided by the `django_migrations` table. The proposed changes also guard against potential issues where migrations might be reapplied or incorrectly ignored due to stale records in the database."
