        "intended_behavior": "This class should incorporate a new method (e.g., `validate_migrations_existence`) tasked with checking the `django_migrations` table for any records of migrations that no longer exist in the file system. It might need to access the migration file directory to compare the list of migrations in the filesystem against those recorded in the database. Migrations listed in the database but not found in the file system should be handled appropriately, possibly with a mechanism to retain records of migrations that are intentionally \"squashed\" but still acknowledged by newer migration files."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `migrate` method to integrate a call to the newly proposed `MigrationRecorder.validate_migrations_existence` method at a strategic point before applying migrations. This adjustment ensures that the database's `django_migrations` table reflects only those migrations that are actively part of the project or are acknowledged by squashed migrations. Care must be taken to ensure this validation does not impede the squash migrations process or inadvertently remove historical data necessary for future rollbacks or audits."
