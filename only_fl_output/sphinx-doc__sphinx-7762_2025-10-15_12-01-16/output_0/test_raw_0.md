Below is the `reproducer.py` file designed to reproduce the issue described. The script mimics the behavior of sending an HTTP request with a custom `Accept` header to the specified GitHub Actions badge URL and expects a `200 OK` response. If the response status is different (e.g., `406 Not Acceptable`), the script raises an `AssertionError`, leveraging the provided `print_stacktrace` function to give insight into the exception.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_request_with_custom_headers():
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    # Customizing the HTTP 'Accept' header as alleged in the issue's description.
    # It's set to a value that GitHub's server originally responds to with 'HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable'.
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
        'User-Agent': 'Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4'
    }
    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)
    # The expected status code is 200 OK. If the received status code is not 200, raise an AssertionError
    try:
        assert response.status_code == 200, f"Expected status code 200, got {response.status_code}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        make_request_with_custom_headers()
        print("Success: The issue is not present, or it has been fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

When executed (`python3 reproducer.py`), this script attempts to reproduce the issue by sending an HTTP request including a hardcoded custom `Accept` header that the GitHub server is expected to respond to unfavorably (with a `406 Not Acceptable` status). If the `Accept` header modification causes a response different from `200 OK`, it's indicative that the issue persists, triggering an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the response status is `200 OK`, it implies the issue is either not present or has been resolved, and the script exits gracefully with code `0`.
