Even though `clim` is not a direct parameter, `vmin` and `vmax` serve its purpose. The function should ensure that these values, when provided, correctly adjust the color scaling to reflect the specified limits. To resolve the issue, ensure that when `vmin` and `vmax` are set, their values are used to limit the color scaling directly before the call to `_scale_norm`, preserving the expected functionality of adjusting color scale limits. This might require updating the logic around how `vmin` and `vmax` are handled, ensuring they are always considered when scaling the norm and hence affecting the color mapping as per user expectation.\n\n**Intended Modifications to Resolve the Issue:**\n- Verify that `vmin` and `vmax` parameters are correctly utilized to influence the color mapping scale, ensuring they are effectively passed to `_scale_norm` with the correct priority and application to reflect the user-defined color limits.\n- If necessary, implement additional checks or logic before the call to `collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)` in `tripcolor` to ascertain that these parameters (`vmin`, `vmax`) correctly adjust the color mapping within the plotting function, ensuring it is within the bounds defined by the `clim` parameter or its equivalent, `vmin` and `vmax`. This might involve examining the interaction between `vmin`, `vmax`, and `norm` to ensure that the precedence and effect of these parameters are as intended.\n- Maintain all existing functionalities of `tripcolor`, ensuring that any adjustments made to accommodate the `clim` behavior do not adversely affect the behavior of other parameters or the function's overall capabilities."
