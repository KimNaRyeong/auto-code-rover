        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather relevant context about how `tripcolor` function handles the `clim` parameter, as well as where and how it should properly apply normalization or scaling of colors according to that parameter. The described bug indicates that the handling of `kwargs`, specifically `clim`, needs to be adjusted within the implementation of `tripcolor`. Given that the `clim` parameter is supposed to control the limits of the color scaling, we should focus on the implementation details of `tripcolor` and related mechanisms for color scaling, such as `_scale_norm`, mentioned in the issue. These details would be essential for crafting a fix.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"tripcolor\"): To locate the `tripcolor` method in the codebase.\n- search_method(\"_scale_norm\"): To find the `_scale_norm` method, as it is likely related to the handling of color scaling and may be the method where `clim` should be taken into account."
