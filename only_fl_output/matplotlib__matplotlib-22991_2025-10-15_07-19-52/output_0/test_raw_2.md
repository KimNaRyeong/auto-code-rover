Based on your specific instructions for creating a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that should either result in an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or exit with code 0 if fixed, hereâ€™s a refined approach considering your guidelines and the initial setup:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    try:
        fig = plt.figure()
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(2, 1)

        axarr = subfigs[0].subplots(2, 2)
        plt.sca(axarr[0, 0])

        # If the code reaches here without exceptions, the issue is considered fixed.
        print("No issues detected, which may indicate the problem has been fixed.")
        return 0

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue with plt.sca() on axes created using subfigures detected.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, when executed with `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project, will attempt to replicate the issue mentioned. If the issue exists (i.e., `plt.sca()` results in a `TypeError` when used with axes created using subfigures), it will catch the exception, print the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace(e)` function, and then raise an `AssertionError` indicating the problem's presence.

If the execution does not encounter any exceptions, indicating that either the issue might have been resolved or does not exist under the current testing environment, it will simply print out a message stating no issues were detected and exit with code 0. 

This approach ensures that there's a clear and automated way to identify the presence of the issue based on the exception handling around the problematic code snippet.
