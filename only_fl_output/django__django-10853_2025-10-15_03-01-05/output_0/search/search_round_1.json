        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for creating a patch to address the issue of SQLite version incompatibility with window functions and how Django handles it, I need to explore several parts of Django's codebase. Here are the API calls I would make to obtain this context:\n\n1. Identify where Django checks the SQLite version to see if there's a pre-existing mechanism that can be extended or if a new check needs to be implemented. Since the issue pertains to SQLite database usage, it's likely within Django's database backend for SQLite. I will search for code responsible for establishing database connections or executing SQL commands as a starting point.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"sqlite3.connect\")\nsearch_code(\"execute\")\n```\n\n2. Django raises exceptions for database errors through a layer that wraps around the database calls. I need to see how Django currently handles `OperationalError` for SQLite, as this is the exception type mentioned in the issue. This might involve searching for where `OperationalError` is caught and re-raised as `django.db.utils.OperationalError`.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"OperationalError\")\n```\n\n3. Investigate Django's handling of database features based on version compatibility. This includes looking for any mechanism that Django uses to conditionally enable or disable features based on the database version. This might be part of the database backend initialization or a utility function/module.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"database features\")\nsearch_code(\"version compatibility\")\n```\n\n4. Finally, to properly address the issue and contribute a fix, I should look at how window functions are integrated into Django's ORM, specifically how the `Window` expression and `RowNumber` function are processed. This will provide clues on where to inject the version check or how to gracefully degrade when window functions are not supported by the SQLite version in use.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Window\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"RowNumber\", \"Window\")\n```\n\nThese searches will give me a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of Django's codebase that I need to understand and modify to resolve the issue described."

        "content": "After reviewing the collected context from the API calls, let\u2019s address each piece of information to understand the problem better, decide on the necessary next steps, and identify potential solutions for the reported issue with SQLite version and window functions in Django.\n\n### 1. `sqlite3.connect` and `execute`\nWhile we did not find explicit references to `sqlite3.connect`, we found many instances of `execute` in various backend files. The `execute` method appears throughout Django's database interaction layer, particularly in files related to specific database backends (e.g., `sqlite3`, `mysql`, `postgresql`) and operations (e.g., `schema.py`, `base.py`, `operations.py`). \n\n**Analysis:**\n- These occurrences suggest where Django executes SQL commands, which includes places where modifications could be made to handle SQLite version incompatibilities.\n- The bug is related to SQL execution, specifically for SQLite when using window functions which are not supported in versions prior to 3.25.0. Django does not currently prevent or flag the use of window functions on unsupported SQLite versions, leading to runtime `OperationalError`s.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Ideally, Django would detect the SQLite version at runtime and either prevent the use of unsupported window functions or provide a clear, informative error message prior to attempting SQL execution that would result in an `OperationalError`.\n\n### 2. `OperationalError`\nOccurrences of `OperationalError` were noted in several places, including `django/db/__init__.py`, `utils.py`, `mysql/base.py`, and others. This suggests Django has a centralized mechanism for handling such SQL execution errors but does not specifically tailor its response to issues of SQLite version compatibility.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This is directly related to the bug since the issue arises as an `OperationalError`.\n- The presence of `OperationalError` in `utils.py` might be where Django translates lower-level database errors into exceptions that Django can manage more gracefully.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Modify the handling of `OperationalError` to check if it stems from using window functions on an unsupported SQLite version and raise a more informative error if so.\n\n### 3. Database Features and Version Compatibility\nNo direct findings were returned for \"database features\" or \"version compatibility,\" indicating that Django may not have a specific mechanism in place to handle feature support queries or checks against database version numbers within the codebase.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Given Django supports multiple database backends with differing capabilities and versions, it would be beneficial to have a feature check mechanism, especially for features like window functions that are not universally supported across all versions.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Implementing a way to dynamically check for database version compatibility before attempting to use features that may not be supported on the current version.\n\n### 4. `Window` Class from `django/db/models/expressions.py`\nThe `Window` class encapsulates the SQL window function construct within Django's ORM. It allows defining window expressions, including partitioning and ordering, that can be compiled into SQL.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This class is directly involved in the bug since it represents the ORM's entry point for window functions, which fail on older SQLite versions.\n- There's no indication within the class that Django performs any version checks before generating the SQL.\n\n**Intended behavior:**\n- Extend the `Window` class, or its usage patterns, to include a compatibility check for the database version specifically for SQLite, preventing the execution of window functions on unsupported versions and raising a clear, actionable error.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the analyses above, several next steps emerge:\n\n- **Perform a more detailed search** around the initialization and configuration of database connections in Django (perhaps missed under `sqlite3.connect` due to indirect invocation patterns) to find where version checks could be inserted.\n- **Review existing database feature flags or compatibility layers** to understand how Django might already be conditioning feature availability on other database backends. This might involve:\n  - Searching specifically for how Django initializes database connections (`search_code(\"DatabaseWrapper\")`, `search_method_in_file(\"init_connection_state\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`)\n  - Investigating existing patterns for handling database-specific features and exceptions (`search_code_in_file(\"feature_flag\", \"django/db/backends/*\")`, `search_method(\"check_constraints\")`).\n- **Investigating `Window` class usage** further to devise a strategy for incorporating version checks seamlessly into its logic. \n\nBy addressing these considerations, we can approach creating a patch that mitigates the mentioned issue efficiently, maintaining Django's philosophy of gracefully handling database abstraction across various backends."

This method should be called during the initialization of the database connection. This information should then be leveraged to determine feature support compatibility throughout Django's ORM operations, specifically for features like window functions that depend on the database version.\n\nLocation 2: File: django/db/models/expressions.py, Class: Window\n- Intended Behavior: Before generating the SQL for window functions, the `Window` class or the mechanism that compiles `Window` expressions into SQL should query the database version compatibility (using the information stored in the `DatabaseWrapper` during connection initialization). If the SQLite version is detected to be less than 3.25.0, the method should raise a `NotSupportedError` (or a similar custom exception) that clearly indicates window functions are not supported on the connected SQLite version. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality by allowing window function usage on supported database versions while providing clear error handling for unsupported versions."
