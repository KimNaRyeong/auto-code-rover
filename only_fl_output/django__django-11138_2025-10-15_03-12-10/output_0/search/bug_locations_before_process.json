        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `_convert_field_to_tz` method to check if the database's `TIME_ZONE` matches the Django `TIME_ZONE` setting. If they match, it should return `field_name` without applying any `CONVERT_TZ` operation. This addresses the reported issue by ensuring that when the database and Django's time zones are the same, queries do not attempt unnecessary time zone conversions. Additionally, it could be beneficial if this method dynamically retrieved the database's `TIME_ZONE` setting if specified, rather than assuming 'UTC' as the default. This would allow correct handling of cases where the database timestamps are not stored in UTC. The method should still retain its functionality to convert time zones when necessary (i.e., when the database's `TIME_ZONE` and Django's setting differ) to preserve the existing functionality for scenarios where conversions are indeed required. This adjustment ensures the database operations respect the configured time zones correctly, fixing the issue of illogical and unnecessary conversions. It maintains existing functionality by continuing to allow time zone conversions when the settings do not match but optimizes performance and accuracy when they do."
