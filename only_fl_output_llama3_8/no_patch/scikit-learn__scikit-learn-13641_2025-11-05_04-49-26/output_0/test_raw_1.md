The issue is not with the script itself, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. The error message indicates that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce this issue, you would need to install scikit-learn from source and then run the reproducer script. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository: `git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned directory: `cd scikit-learn`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Build scikit-learn: `python setup.py build`
5. Run the reproducer script: `python reproducer.py`

Here's what the reproducer script should look like:

```py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import sys
import traceback

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')
    cv.fit(['hello world']).vocabulary_
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

Please note that this script will only reproduce the issue if scikit-learn is installed from source and has not been built correctly.
