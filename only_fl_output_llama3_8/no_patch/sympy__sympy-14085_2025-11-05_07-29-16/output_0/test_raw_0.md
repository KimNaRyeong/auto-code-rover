Here is the reproducer script:

```python
import sympy as sp
from sympy import S, Symbol

def main():
    try:
        sp.sympify("α")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue should not be present")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to use `sympify` with the Greek letter "α". If an exception is raised, it prints the stack trace and raises an `AssertionError`.
