The issue is not with the reproducer script itself, but rather with the way scikit-learn was installed. The error message suggests that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce the issue, you can try installing scikit-learn from source and then running the reproducer script. Here's an example of how to do this:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
cd scikit-learn
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build and install scikit-learn:
```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```
5. Create a new file called `reproducer.py` with the following contents:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    binary_data = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]], dtype="bool").reshape((2, 6))
    pairwise_distances(binary_data, metric="jaccard")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")
sys.exit(0)
```
6. Run the reproducer script:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```
This should raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the error.

Note that this is just one possible way to reproduce the issue, and there may be other ways to do so depending on your specific environment and setup.
