Here is the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue:

```py
import json
from walrus import *

def test_json_encoder():
    assert (object:="foo") in json.dumps(object)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_json_encoder()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1 if isinstance(e, AssertionError) else 0)
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

You can run this script by executing `python3 reproducer.py`.
