Sets up a minimal Django environment to ensure that the HttpResponse class is properly configured.\n2. Tries three different `HttpResponse` creations: one with a string, one with bytes, and one with a `memoryview` object.\n3. Checks if the content of the `HttpResponse` matches the expected bytes string (`b\"My Content\"`) in each case.\n4. If the `memoryview` test fails, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function.\n5. Exits with code 0 if all tests pass.\n\nYou can run this script using `python3 reproducer.py` to check for the presence of the issue. The script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace if there's a problem with handling `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`.\n\nMake sure you have Django installed in your environment before running the script (`pip install Django`)."
