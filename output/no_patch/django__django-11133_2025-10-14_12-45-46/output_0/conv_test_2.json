Note that it uses a minimalist Django setup, requiring only the `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` settings to be configured for the purpose of creating a `HttpResponse`. \n\nMake sure Django is installed in your Python environment and that you're prepared for a minimalist Django command execution (`django-admin check`) within the script to bootstrap the minimal Django context necessary for `HttpResponse` to function as expected."
