I understand the task, and for a more precise approach, let me write a correct `reproducer.py` with detailed error tracing. This script is designed to run in a Django environment, to specifically reproduce the issue related to handling `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`. Please ensure Django is installed and properly configured before running this script. 

```python
# reproducer.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.conf import settings
import os

# Setup minimal settings for Django required to use HttpResponse
settings.configure(
    SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',
    DEBUG=True,
)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to instantiate HttpResponse with different types of content and verify the output
    try:
        # Test case with str content
        response = HttpResponse("Normal string")
        assert response.content == b"Normal string", "Failed: str handling"

        # Test case with bytes content
        response = HttpResponse(b"Bytes content")
        assert response.content == b"Bytes content", "Failed: bytes handling"
        
        # Test case with memoryview content
        response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"Memoryview content"))
        # Here is the assertion which should fail if the issue is present
        assert response.content == b"Memoryview content", "Failed: memoryview handling"
        
        print("Issue is fixed, all checks passed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    
    # Initialize Django to avoid SystemCheckError
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', __name__)
    execute_from_command_line(['django-admin', 'check'])
    
    # Run the test case
    main()
```

This script systematically checks the handling of `HttpResponse` with different types of contents including `memoryview`, raising an `AssertionError` with a complete stack trace if the issue is present. Note that it uses a minimalist Django setup, requiring only the `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG` settings to be configured for the purpose of creating a `HttpResponse`. 

Make sure Django is installed in your Python environment and that you're prepared for a minimalist Django command execution (`django-admin check`) within the script to bootstrap the minimal Django context necessary for `HttpResponse` to function as expected.
