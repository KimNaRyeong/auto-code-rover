        "intended_behavior": "The setter method for `content` in the `HttpResponse` class should be able to handle `memoryview` objects properly. When a `memoryview` object is passed to `response.content`, the setter must automatically convert it into bytes before storing it. This conversion ensures that the actual content of the `memoryview` is correctly reflected as the response body, instead of its string representation. This behavior should preserve the existing functionality for handling strings and bytestrings, only extending it to correctly manage `memoryview` objects by converting them to bytestrings (`memoryview.tobytes()`). This adjustment will align the handling of content from databases like Postgresql that return `memoryview` objects for binary fields, ensuring consistent behavior with other types of content."
