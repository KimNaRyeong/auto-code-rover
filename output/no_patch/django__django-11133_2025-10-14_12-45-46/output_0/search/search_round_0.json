When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n# String content\nresponse = HttpResponse(\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is correct\n# Bytes content\nresponse = HttpResponse(b\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is also correct\n# memoryview content\nresponse = HttpResponse(memoryview(b\"My Content\"))\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'\n# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'\n</issue>"

Therefore, I'd like to make the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")` - To locate the file and the class definition of `HttpResponse`.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"HttpResponse\")` - To understand how `HttpResponse` is initialized and if the issue arises from the initialization process.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__setitem__\", \"HttpResponse\")` - If setting the content uses a method like this, to see how it handles different types of content.\n4. `search_code(\"response.content\")` - Directly search for handling of the `response.content` attribute to see where and how content is processed and assigned.\n\nThese searches should provide an adequate overview of how `HttpResponse` manages its content and where adjustments might be needed to support `memoryview` objects properly."
