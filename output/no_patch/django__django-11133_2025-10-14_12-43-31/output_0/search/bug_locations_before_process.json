        "intended_behavior": "The `make_bytes` method should be updated to include a check for `memoryview` objects. If the input value is of type `memoryview`, it should directly convert the `memoryview` to bytes using `value.tobytes()` before any further processing. This will ensure that `memoryview` objects are correctly handled, preserving the byte content they represent."
