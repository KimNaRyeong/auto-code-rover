        "intended_behavior": "The content setter method in the `HttpResponse` class should be modified to explicitly handle `memoryview` objects by converting them into bytes before storing them in the `_container`. This change should ensure that when a `memoryview` object is provided to the `HttpResponse` constructor or assigned to an instance's content attribute, it is automatically converted to its byte representation, making it consistent with the handling of bytes and string types. This modification preserves the existing functionality for other types (strings, bytes, and generic iterables) while extending correct handling to `memoryview` objects. This will address the reported issue by ensuring that `memoryview` content is accurately represented as bytes in the HTTP response."
