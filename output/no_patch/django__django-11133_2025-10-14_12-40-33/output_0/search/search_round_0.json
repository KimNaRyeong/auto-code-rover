When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n# String content\nresponse = HttpResponse(\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is correct\n# Bytes content\nresponse = HttpResponse(b\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is also correct\n# memoryview content\nresponse = HttpResponse(memoryview(b\"My Content\"))\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'\n# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue related to `HttpResponse` not handling `memoryview` objects correctly, we would require more context about the `HttpResponse` class and how it processes the content assigned to it. Specifically, we need to uncover how various types of content (like strings, bytes, and in this case, `memoryview` objects) are managed and transformed internally.\n\nFirst, we need to explore the implementation of the `HttpResponse` class to understand its structure and the methods responsible for handling and storing response content. This can give us insight into where the issue with `memoryview` objects might arise.\n\nNext, we should examine how the `HttpResponse` class handles content assignments, especially focusing on methods that might deal with content conversion or serialization.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Searching for the `HttpResponse` class:\n   - `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")`\n\n2. Searching for methods within `HttpResponse` that might be relevant to setting or mutating the response content:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue may involve how specific types of content are processed or encoded, it might be helpful to see if there's a dedicated method for handling `memoryview` or a generic method that deals with different content types that might not adequately cover `memoryview` objects.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__setitem__\", \"HttpResponse\")`"
