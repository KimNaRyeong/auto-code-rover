Purpose of the Code:\n- The `HttpResponse` class is responsible for constructing HTTP responses.\n- The `content` property (getter) retrieves the content stored in `_container`.\n- The `content` setter assigns new content to the response, handling both iterable and non-iterable cases.\n\n#### 2. Relationship to the Bug:\n- The `content` setter handles different types of content, but it does not explicitly check for `memoryview` objects.\n- When `memoryview` is passed, it is treated not as a `bytes` or `str`, leading to the unexpected behavior reported in the issue.\n\n#### 3. Intended Behavior:\n- The `content` setter should recognize `memoryview` objects and convert them to bytes before storing them in `_container`.\n- This behavior should be similar to how `bytes` and `str` are handled.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step is to investigate if there is a utility method `make_bytes` in `HttpResponse` that can handle the conversion of `memoryview` to `bytes`.\n\n### Next API Call:\n- **Search for the `make_bytes` method in the `HttpResponse` class** to check if it can handle `memoryview` or if it needs modification.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"make_bytes\", \"HttpResponse\")\n```"

This should resolve the reported issue while preserving existing functionality."
