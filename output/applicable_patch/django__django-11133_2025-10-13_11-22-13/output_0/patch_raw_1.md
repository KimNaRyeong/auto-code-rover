To resolve the issue with handling `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`, we need to adjust the `content` setter method to properly convert `memoryview` objects to bytes before storing them in `_container`. The `make_bytes` method or an equivalent approach will be utilized to ensure this conversion.

Here is the patch for the issue:

        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
            content = b''.join(self.make_bytes(chunk) for chunk in value)
            if hasattr(value, 'close'):
                try:
                    value.close()
                except Exception:
                    pass
        else:
            content = self.make_bytes(value)

        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
            content = b''.join(self.make_bytes(chunk) for chunk in value)
            if hasattr(value, 'close'):
                try:
                    value.close()
                except Exception:
                    pass
        else:
            if isinstance(value, memoryview):
                value = value.tobytes()
            content = self.make_bytes(value)
</patched>
```

In this patch, we have introduced a condition to check if the value is an instance of `memoryview` and convert it to bytes using `tobytes()` before processing it with `make_bytes`. This should ensure that `HttpResponse` handles `memoryview` objects properly, as expected.
