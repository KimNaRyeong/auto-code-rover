To resolve the issue of `HttpResponse` not handling `memoryview` objects correctly, we need to ensure that `memoryview` objects are properly converted to bytes before being stored in `_container`. This can be achieved by modifying the `make_bytes` method to handle `memoryview` objects.

Here is the patch that resolves the issue:

# modification 1
```
<file>django/http/response.py</file>
<original>
def make_bytes(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, bytes):
        return bytes(value)
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        return value.encode(self.charset)
    else:
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)
</original>
<patched>
def make_bytes(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, bytes):
        return bytes(value)
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        return value.encode(self.charset)
    elif isinstance(value, memoryview):
        return value.tobytes()
    else:
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)
</patched>
```

The above modification ensures that `memoryview` objects are properly converted to bytes before they are used to set the `content` attribute of `HttpResponse`. 

No further changes are needed as the `content` property setter and other parts of the code already utilize the `make_bytes` method correctly. Thus, this single modification will ensure that `memoryview` objects are handled properly.
