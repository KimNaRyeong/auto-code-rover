However, it doesn't explicitly handle `memoryview` objects, which is causing the issue described.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The setter should correctly handle `memoryview` objects by converting them into bytes before setting the `_container` attribute.\n\n### Next Steps\nWe need to find and understand the `make_bytes` method to see how it handles different types of input and potentially modify it to handle `memoryview` objects.\n\nLet's use the following API call to proceed:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"make_bytes\", \"HttpResponse\")\n```"
