We have enough context to proceed with the fix.\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `django/http/response.py`\n  - **Class:** `HttpResponse`\n  - **Method:** `content (setter at line 310)`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** \n    - The `content` setter method must be modified to handle `memoryview` objects by converting them into bytes using the `bytes()` function. \n    - This will ensure that when a `memoryview` object is provided, it is correctly converted to bytes before being processed and stored in `_container`.\n    - The behavior should preserve existing functionality for other content types (e.g., strings, bytes, and iterables).\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere\u2019s how the patch should be implemented to extend the `content` setter method to handle `memoryview` objects correctly:\n\n```python\ndef content(self, value):\n    # Consume iterators upon assignment to allow repeated iteration.\n    if isinstance(value, memoryview):\n        content = bytes(value)\n    elif hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):\n        content = b''.join(self.make_bytes(chunk) for chunk in value)\n        if hasattr(value, 'close'):\n            try:\n                value.close()\n            except Exception:\n                pass\n    else:\n        content = self.make_bytes(value)\n    # Create a list of properly encoded bytestrings to support write().\n    self._container = [content]\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the `memoryview` object is converted to bytes, thus resolving the issue described. The change preserves the existing functionality for other types of content by integrating smoothly into the current logic."
