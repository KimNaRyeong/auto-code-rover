To resolve the issue where `HttpResponse` doesn't handle `memoryview` objects correctly, we need to modify the setter for `content` in the `HttpResponse` class. Specifically, we should add a condition to check if the value is a `memoryview` and convert it to bytes if it is.

Here is the patch to address the issue:

# modification 1
```
<file>django/http/response.py</file>
<original>
        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
</original>
<patched>
        if isinstance(value, memoryview):
            value = bytes(value)
        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```
<file>django/http/response.py</file>
<original>
        else:
</original>
<patched>
        elif not isinstance(value, memoryview):
</patched>
```

This patch ensures that `memoryview` objects are properly handled by converting them into bytes before they are processed and stored in `_container`. The changes are minimal and preserve the existing functionality for other content types.
