Here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue as described. The script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. The script will exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

```python
import sys
from django.http import HttpResponse

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_memoryview_in_httpresponse():
    try:
        # memoryview content
        response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))
        expected_content = b"My Content"
        actual_content = response.content

        # Raise an assertion error if the actual content does not match the expected content.
        assert actual_content == expected_content, (
            f"Expected content {expected_content}, but got {actual_content}."
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # re-raise the exception to indicate the test failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_memoryview_in_httpresponse()
        print("Test passed. HttpResponse handles memoryview objects correctly.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate that the issue is present
```

This script reproduces the issue by trying to use a `memoryview` object in `HttpResponse`. If the `actual_content` does not match the expected byte string, an `AssertionError` is raised, and the stack trace is printed using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. Additionally, it exits with code 1 indicating the issue is present. If the test passes, it prints a success message and exits with code 0.
