The class contains several methods and properties, of which the following are particularly relevant to understand how content is handled:\n\n1. `__init__(self, content=b'', *args, **kwargs)`\n2. `@property def content(self)`\n3. `@content.setter def content(self, value)`\n\n### Analysis\n1. **`__init__(self, content=b'', *args, **kwargs)`**:\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     This is the constructor of the `HttpResponse` class, which initializes the response content.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     This method sets the initial content of the response, which might be where the issue with `memoryview` objects starts.\n   - **Intended Behavior:**\n     This should correctly assign the given content, whether it's a string, bytes, or memoryview.\n\n2. **`@property def content(self)` and `@content.setter def content(self, value)`**:\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     The `content` property and its setter method are used to get and set the response content.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     The setter method is crucial as it will determine how the content (including `memoryview` objects) is handled.\n   - **Intended Behavior:**\n     It should properly convert or handle different content types into the desired byte representation.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo address the issue:\n1. Investigate how the `content` setter method handles the assignment of different content types, especially `memoryview`.\n2. Investigate the `__init__` method to see whether initial content assignments are handled correctly.\n\nLet's proceed by getting details of the `__init__` method and the `content` property and its setter.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"HttpResponse\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")\n```"

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Specifically, for `memoryview` objects, it should convert the memory view to bytes so that the content is correctly represented.\n\n#### Location 2\n- **File:** `django/http/response.py`\n- **Class:** `HttpResponse`\n- **Method:** `content` (setter)\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe `content` setter method should correctly process different types of content (including `str`, `bytes`, and `memoryview`). For `memoryview`, it should convert the content to bytes so it can be correctly served in the HTTP response. This processing should ensure that the existing handling of `str` and `bytes` remains unchanged."
