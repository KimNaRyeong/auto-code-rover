Search for the `HttpResponse` class to identify which file it is located in.\n2. Once we have the file, we will search for the methods within that class to understand its behavior.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `HttpResponse` class.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"HttpResponse\")\n```\n\nOnce we have the file in which `HttpResponse` is defined, we will proceed with searching for methods within this file."
