### Reasoning:

The primary goal to resolve the issue is to ensure that when a memoryview object is assigned to `HttpResponse.content`, it is converted to bytes, just like when content is passed as `str` or `bytes`. This requires handling within the `content` setter method of `HttpResponse` class.

We need to modify:
1. The `content` setter method (`content`) to handle `memoryview` objects by converting them to bytes.
2. Optionally check in the `__init__` method if we need to convert `memoryview` there specifically.

The main change will be in the `content` setter to ensure any `memoryview` object is converted to bytes properly.

### Patch:

# modification 1
```
<file>django/http/response.py</file>
<original>
    def __init__(self, content=b'', *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Content is a bytestring. See the `content` property methods.
        self.content = content
</original>
<patched>
    def __init__(self, content=b'', *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Content is a bytestring. See the `content` property methods.
        if isinstance(content, memoryview):
            content = bytes(content)
        self.content = content
</patched>
```

# modification 2
```
<file>django/http/response.py</file>
<original>
    def content(self, value):
        # Consume iterators upon assignment to allow repeated iteration.
        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
            content = b''.join(self.make_bytes(chunk) for chunk in value)
            if hasattr(value, 'close'):
                try:
                    value.close()
                except Exception:
                    pass
        else:
            content = self.make_bytes(value)
        # Create a list of properly encoded bytestrings to support write().
        self._container = [content]
</original>
<patched>
    def content(self, value):
        # Consume iterators upon assignment to allow repeated iteration.
        if isinstance(value, memoryview):
            value = bytes(value)
        
        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
            content = b''.join(self.make_bytes(chunk) for chunk in value)
            if hasattr(value, 'close'):
                try:
                    value.close()
                except Exception:
                    pass
        else:
            content = self.make_bytes(value)
        # Create a list of properly encoded bytestrings to support write().
        self._container = [content]
</patched>
```

These changes will ensure that `memoryview` objects passed as content to `HttpResponse` are properly converted to bytes, addressing the issue raised.
