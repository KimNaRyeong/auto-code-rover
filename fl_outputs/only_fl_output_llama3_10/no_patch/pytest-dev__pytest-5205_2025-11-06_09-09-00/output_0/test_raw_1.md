Here is the reproducer script:

```python
import pytest
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def test_xml_generation():
    @given(x=strategies.integers(1, 10))
    def inner_test_xml_generation(x):
        assert 1 <= x <= 10

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        pytest.main(["--junitxml=report.xml", "-v"])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
```

To run the reproducer, execute `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal. This script should reproduce the issue and print a stack trace when it fails.
