I apologize for the mistake. Here is a new standalone Python file `reproducer.py` to reproduce the issue:
```
import pytest
import sys
import traceback

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
        expected_result = {"a": None}
        approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
        assert approx_expected_result == actual_result
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

Please make sure that you have pytest installed in your Python environment before running this script. You can install pytest using pip: `pip install pytest`.
