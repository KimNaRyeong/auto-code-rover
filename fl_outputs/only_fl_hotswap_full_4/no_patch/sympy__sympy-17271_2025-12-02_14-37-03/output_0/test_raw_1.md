 Here is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue:
```python
from sympy import frac, zoo, S

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        f = frac(zoo)
        assert False, "Expected TypeError, but got no exception"
    except TypeError:
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
When executed with `python3 reproducer.py`, the script will raise an `AssertionError` with a stack trace, indicating that the expected `TypeError` was not raised. This reproduces the issue described in the original post.

If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, as there will be no `AssertionError` raised.
