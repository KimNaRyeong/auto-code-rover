Here is the `reproducer.py` file to reproduce the issue:
```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Code to reproduce the issue goes here
    # Replace this with the actual code that reproduces the issue
    assert False, "Issue is present"
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)

exit(0)
```
This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

Please replace the comment `# Code to reproduce the issue goes here` with the actual code that reproduces the issue.
