It seems that the issue is not with the code itself, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. Here is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` file:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
    mutual_info_score(x, x)
except ValueError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
else:
    raise AssertionError("Expected ValueError, but no exception was raised")
```
This script will try to execute the code that reproduces the issue. If a `ValueError` is raised, it will print the stack trace of the error. If no exception is raised, it will raise an `AssertionError`.
