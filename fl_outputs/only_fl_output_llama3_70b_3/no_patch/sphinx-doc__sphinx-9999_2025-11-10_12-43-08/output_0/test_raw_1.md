I apologize for the previous mistake. Here is a new standalone Python file `reproducer.py` to reproduce the issue:
```python
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from sphinx.builders.latex import LaTeXBuilder
from sphinx.writers.latex import LaTeXWriter

def reproducer():
    # Create a temporary directory for the project
    tmp_dir = "tmp_latex_issue"
    os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Create a sample reStructuredText file
    rst_file = os.path.join(tmp_dir, "listing.rst")
    with open(rst_file, "w") as f:
        f.write("""
Listing:

:samp:`{file}.cc` :samp:`{file}.cp` :samp:`{file}.cxx` :samp:`{file}.cpp` :samp:`{file}.CPP` :samp:`{file}.c++` :samp:`{file}.C`
  C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in :samp:`.cxx`,
  the last two letters must both be literally :samp:`x`.  Likewise,
  :samp:`.C` refers to a literal capital C.

:samp:`{file}.mm` :samp:`{file}.M`
  Objective-C++ source code that must be preprocessed.
