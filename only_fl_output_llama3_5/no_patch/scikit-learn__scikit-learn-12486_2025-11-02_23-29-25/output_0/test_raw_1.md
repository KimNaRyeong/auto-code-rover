The issue is not with the reproducer script itself, but rather with the environment in which it's being run. The error message indicates that scikit-learn has not been built correctly and suggests running `python setup.py install` or `make` to build the package.

To reproduce the issue, you can try installing scikit-learn from source and then running the reproducer script. Here is an example of how you might do this:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
cd scikit-learn
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build scikit-learn from source:
```
python setup.py build
```
5. Run the reproducer script:
```
python reproducer.py
```

This should reproduce the issue and print a stack trace to the console.

Here is an example of what the reproducer script might look like:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.mixture import GMM

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    X, y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)
    gmm_model = GMM()
    param_grid = {'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']}
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')
    try:
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Expected an AssertionError"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script should raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace to the console.
