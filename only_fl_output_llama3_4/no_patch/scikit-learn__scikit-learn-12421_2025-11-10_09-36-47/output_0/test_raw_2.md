The issue is not with the code you provided, but rather with how scikit-learn was installed. The error message indicates that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

Here is a standalone python file `reproducer.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS
    except ImportError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and print a stack trace of the issue. It will also exit with code 1.

Please note that this script does not actually test the OPTICS class, but rather checks if it can be imported correctly.
